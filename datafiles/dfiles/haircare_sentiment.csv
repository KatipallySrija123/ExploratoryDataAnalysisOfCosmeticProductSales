It helps when creating styles, then trying to pull them off a cardboard. When you are done you can put them back into the container. So, the are not all over the place! Alright. So I bought these over a year ago and I'm not even halfway through them! 300 is a lot, but when it comes to bobby pins, it's a LOT. These are a bargain, which is good. They are also cheaply made, which is not so good. I use a lot of bobby pins in my hair daily. I have some baby hairs that I like to secure by criss-crossing bobby pins together. But here's the thing- the black paint chips off of these when I do that. It's a bummer, but for the bargain I got, these can be disposable bobby pins for all I care. I mean, I still have more than half after a year. If you use these without criss-crossing them, you should be fine. Oh, and my boyfriend hates these because, you know, endless bobby pins to find everywhere :) For me, this purchase was pretty simple. Do I buy a pack of 100 for $2.99 on some paper thing, that eventually becomes a poor way of storage, or do I buy a 300 pack that comes with a tub?I purchased the black ones and they work great. Granted, there is a hairdresser in a review below that disagrees with me and you should definitely take her review to heart, in addition to mine. They're coated in sort of a rubbery coating and they stay in my hair. I have very fine curls and they work in my hair as well as my daughter's medium curls. They provide the hold you would expect and appear to be of good quality. I could have a pile of bobby pins as large as mount Everest and that still wouldn't be enough bobby pins. So, I just settle for this great pack of bobby pins instead. I like the size which is pretty standard to the size of an average bobby pin and the price is great for the quantity you get. Some people complained of flaking, and that does occur to a few of the bobby pins  but truthfully it's not much of a problem because I'm much more prone to lose my bobby pins before they are old enough to completely flake off! Bobby pins are a necessity for dancers and cheerleaders and short haired people (which I am) and they work great. Will definitely order again once Bobby pins serve its purpose. However, what I have encountered are the soft ends that are suppose to be securely glued to the harsh ends slips off when removing them from my hair. Almost every morning I typically use roughly 4-6 pins to secure my hair in a soft French roll or to simply push back my hair from my face. They are great little pins but someone (manufacture, maybe) should pay a little bit more attention to the soft plastic ends. I tend to recycle my pins after every use and place the pins back in the container for future use but if the soft plastic ends are no longer there I am one less bobby pin for future styles. At any rate, again they serve its purpose, not all of the plastic ends have come off roughly 5 out of every 10 and it’s a great little tool in any woman’s beauty arsenal. Happy Styling! A few years ago I bought some bobby pins at a boutique in Hong Kong (I think they were made in Japan or Korea) and they are the absolute strongest, most amazing bobby pins I've ever had. I can't find anything that compares since, and unfortunately that includes these. I was hopeful because they get the best reviews on Amazon, and I realize this is a weird item to be picky about, but they just don't measure up to the HK pins. I have thick hair and need tight, flat pins for how I like to style it, and these have more give than I was wanting. Having said that, these pins are similar to most everything else on the US market, maybe even slightly better than what you'd find in Walgreens. And there's LOTS of them, so it's a good bargain. Super good quality bobby pins. I've bought bobby pins at this price before that were so cheap and flimsy. That was not the case with this set. Truly a great value too at this price. I'm a very pleased customer who will totally purchase these again in the future. I've also used these as stocking stuffers because, let's face it, women lose an average of 72 million bobby pins a day! (totally made up statistic, but it feels accurate) And now with the whole man bun trend, you can probably fill some man's stockings with these as well! Bought for daughter. She complains that it doesn't pin and hold hair in place tightly.  It has a tendency to slide off.  I agree.  I use it to pin my bangs back to wash my face, and it doesn't hold it tightly in place like it should.  Still usable and none has broke or was defective.",3,4,-1

roller pack. My pack comes with 10 rollers, so this was perfect. My first impression was that these clips are on the thinner side. They feel lightweight. I was afraid they could easily snap with medium amount of pressure. I was concerned about their longevity, but when I began using them, I realized they had to be light in weight in order to stay in place on my head. The hot rollers are heavy enough, and when you have slick straight hair like mine, it doesn’t take much for things to slip out.I have owned these for years now, and not a single one has snapped or cracked. They are all still intact. I don’t find them to be the most comfortable hot roller clips, and I even find myself using the metal pins that my roller set came with. But, in certain areas on the scalp, these work better than the pins. I have a feeling these clips would work well for those with a slight wave to their hair, or even those with thicker diameter hair shafts. If they can stay up on my straight and thin hair, they ought to be no problem for the wavy and/or thick(er) haired individual. bought these to replace the metal single clips, lost when I moved.  They work well for the most part, the one on top of my head in hair towards the front does leave a dent in my hair. They are easy to work with and put in my hair. Since I don't use all 12 of the curlers, a 10 pack was enough They hurt to put in bc they pull on all your hairs getting in, but they have a pretty dang good hold as long as you're putting your roller in the right direction and all that. Definitely worth the money for me bc my hot rollers came second-hand and they didn't have the original metal pins with them, so I needed something to be able to use them at all. I'm comfortable with the price and quality of the product. Good I have fine hair that will not hold a curl for longer than 30 minutes when using a regular curling iron. I don't like using hairspray, but if I did  the curl would last longer but only for a short time maybe another 30mins. to an hour more. What amazes me about these curlers; it only takes me 5 minutes or less to roll my entire head AND I only leave the rollers in for anywhere from 5- 10 minutes MAX and my hair still has curls when I come home after working 8 hours and zero hairspray. My hair always looks shinier and healthier when I use my rollers.  My hair has bounce and body and yes curl all day.  I love the way my hair feels. This product just blows me away. Every hair salon in the world should use these. They leave no marks in your hair like a curling iron barrel does. It's super fast, and you can add either just great body to your hair in just minutes or very curly curls in as little as 10 minutes. My hair is even more easier to style with the bounce and curls I get using different size curlers in different areas of my head. This is something you can't achieve using a curling iron unless you have 4 different size barrels heating up at one time. Who does that? I  gave away every curling iron I own. I won't use anything else on my hair - if I have to style it,  I have recommended these to anyone who asks what I use on my hair to get the curls I get and I am asked often!! Like many of the other reviews, I too, wish they had 30 clips for the 30 curlers but I purchased 15 extra clips when I purchased the curlers and even though I had to buy extra clips to match the amount curlers supplied -since they only give you 15, I STILL THINK THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY PAID and WORTHY OF 5 STARS!!!! Love it Love it Love it! I have an ancient 12-piece set of the jumbo (1 1/2"") and super jumbo (2"") Conair rollers. I lost the clips so I got these to replace them.  I also wanted to order a second set of rollers but was leery of the poor reviews about the clips.  I am Korean with waist length hair with layers in the front from about my collarbone down.  I have a LOT of thick Asian hair.  These worked just fine with the rollers and my hair - the rollers did not budge.  I was careful not to overstuff the rollers and to make sure I set the clips so the top part was facing up from the roller not hanging down off of it (which is the opposite of how I uses the metal u-shaped clips that originally came with this set - those I like to use poking up, not down). My hair is pretty porous so I do not leave them in very long.  They did leave a slight crimp if they were not set close to the head or completely wrapped arond the roller  and I could see how they could easily get tangled in finer hair.  So maybe if you have smaller rollers and/or very fine hair hair you might be happier with traditional u-shaped clips.  I docked one star because they seem a little flimsy and I think $11 is a little steep for the what you get.  I am about to order a second set of rollers and a second set of clips (remember I have a set of 12 rollers and these come in a set of 10) - a little overpriced but still cheaper than a single professional blowout.  Overall I was pleased with the purchase. Love them! These clips worked perfectly on my hot curlers.",1,4,-3

I can add more to make it hold more, or just do a light dusting.- Doesn’t contain parfum or parabens. It does have a light scent but the ingredients are good.- Washes out fairly easily with a little water.- I’m often too lazy to wash the hairspray out, and so just end up sleeping on it. It actually kinda absorbs into the hair and makes my hair feel good in the morning. My hair style is a set..this product performs well. I have used it for several years and am satisfied with it. I love that this is a clear non-aerosol hair spray and holds my hair in place even whena bit windy, which is often where I live. I've using the GIOVANNI L.A. Hold Hair Spritz for over 10 years. Great hair care product that doesn't require a lot for great holding power! I love this organic hairspray because I don't feel like I'm inhaling chemicals when I use it. It also holds my hair fabulously. Highly recommended. Organic…and even with my thick hair I can easily style my hair with all their products. This product is my favorite hairspray.

I would say I like this version better than the other Joico Color Balance one I tried, but it's not quite as good as Naissant.Pros: It seems just as effective as my favorite brand the day of use and leaves a nice ash shade. It also doesn't dry my hair out as badly as other brands.Cons: It doesn't last...like...at all. I have thin hair, so not shampooing at least every other day is not an option for me. I use a color safe shampoo and this still washes right out after 1-2 washes. I feel like I have to use this 2-3 times a week to really make a difference between colorings. That's a lot of product for very temporary results. Boo.All in all, I will probably keep this on hand for those really sad color days when my hair needs a bump of love, but I am too lazy to tone yet. This is the absolute best sulfate free violet shampoo. I am allergic to sulfates and its hard to find good shampoo without it.  Leave it on too long and your hair WILL be blue. lol  I have had hair that ranged from white blonde to the current popular gray & this shampoo and conditioner has kept it from turning brassy.  I swim twice a week in a heavily chlorinated pool and my hair is never brassy.  I also use this twice a week. I leave it on for approximately 5 minutes but you have to adjust based on your needs.  If for some reason you make your hair too blue just use some regular shampoo w/ baking soda mixed in and it will come out.  Or wait a week and it will fade.  Also, the shampoo does not affect darker hair colors. My roots and the front of my hair is black with a smoky blonde everywhere else and only the blonde is affected by the shampoo/conditioner. I have noticed that it will NOT remove brassiness from darker blonde colors. I am transitioning from dyed brown to letting my natural silver grow in. I have bleached/toned the dyed hair to blend in with the incoming silver. While this keeps my gray/bleached hair from going brassy, it is quite drying and I find that I have to use a deep conditioner along with it. I wash my hair 2 - 3 times a week. To keep it from getting over toned, I would suggest alternating this shampoo with a deep conditioning shampoo/conditioner every other time, if you shampoo frequently. This shampoo works best if you have processed hair with a violet/ash tone. It does work ok if you have a blue/ash undertone, but a shampoo that is blue/violet would work better for that. All in all, a great product, just a bit drying - but a deep conditioner takes care of that. This shampoo is so amazing! It keeps my hair a cool blonde and cancels out any “brass ones”. The pumps in the package were a pleasant surprise because large bottles can be bulky to dispense when turning over in the shower! The smell is sweet and the product leaves my hair soft! My biggest secret is applying to DRY hair for 15 minutes and then hopping in the shower to rinse it out! I see better results this way! Love joico! I am also pregnant and I haven’t dyed my hair in months! This is a life saver! I LOVE this Joico shampoo and conditioner for my color treated hair.  My color doesn't fade and lasts a long time.  It smells great and the conditioner leaves my hair silky soft.  This is by far my favorite shampoo and conditioner! I have fine hair with blonde highlights and lowlights.  I love the shampoo and conditioner.  High quality, nice smell, doesn't weigh down my hair, and it enhances the blonde.  I just switched to this at the recommendation of my stylist.  I highly recommend! My wife loves your product and it makes my life better because I get to shampoo/rinse her hair.  Used to be your bottles always came with pumps which also made my life better because a big heavy bottle can be a risk to toes when you're in the shower, especially if you have to invert it to get shampoo or rinse out.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a picture of a bottle with a pump but  reality bites when the product does not match the picture, yep, no pump.  Do the right thing, bring back the pump and save my toes from possible harm.",5,4,1

NOTHING compared to the performance of this shampoo and I tried even the most expensive products out there.  For me, it's worth the price.  No other shampoo gave me the beautiful soft volume for my fine, static, sometimes frizzy long hair.  I only seemed to have good hair days with this shampoo.  Enter Bain Volumifique, the replacement for Bain Volumactive.  I thought, ""Great, another one of my most valued products reformulated.  I'm going to be very disappointed yet again.""  Sigh.  I went ahead and ordered the new formula and braced myself.  After my first use, I wasn't as disappointed as I thought I would be.  The new formula doesn't leave my hair as soft and voluminous as the original formula.  Volume and softness don't seem to go together with the shampoos that I've tried.  But with the original formula, the impossible was achieved.  Anyway, the new formula was actually good, I was fairly satisfied with the volume, but wish it left my hair with more softness.  Here's the million-dollar question:  Why do companies discontinue or reformulate (not for the better) products that their customers obviously love and don't want changed?  Why? Why? Why?  By the way, I ordered the 1000 ml (34 fl. oz.) and my shipment arrived in poor condition.  The box was almost ripped open and the shampoo leaked a bit.  Given how expensive this shampoo is I think better care should have gone into the packaging. I love the way my hair had volume I have long LONG fine blond hair- and am always looking for and trying new shampoos promising to volumize - and they're usually a joke. Until this product! Actually makes my hair feel and look 3x thkcker!! I wash my hair 3 times a week with it- but do mix in a little of John Frieda's Purple shampoo to help keep my hair a nice blond -and to help add a little moisture; as this shampoo can dry out your hair just a little ( thus the four stars instead of 5 :) ) This is an excellent shampoo - one of the best brands in the field that is usually only available in salons.  Volumizes without being gummy or drying. I had a Rock Band back in the 70's in high school and college, and always liked the longer hair look of the Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin era. Now that I am almost  60, I think I would not mind getting old at all if my hair  would not get any thinner and look as good as Paul M's. lol  I have been using Biolage Hydrating shampoo for 20+ years.  My hair is very fine, and scalp dry, with some dandruff, and started thinning when I was in my early 40's.  I found if I shampooed, used a tiny bit of their conditioner, and rinsed with cool water, then blow dry, my hair looked thicker for most of a day or evening. If I just rinsed with water the next day, it would not blow dry out as full.  Also by washing my hair everyother day it controlled the dandruff.  I am always trying new shampoos when I hear about them, looking for something better than the Biolage.  THAT is why I ordered the Kerastase, after hearing some older ladies at the place where I get my hair cut rave about it.RESULTS:  I used it for 2 weeks, and gave it to a girlfriend.  After washing and blow drying both with and without conditioner, my hair was NO FULLER than with the Biolage, which is HALF the price.  Also after only a  week of use, my hair and my scalp were dryer, and dandruff more noticable.  IMHO, all the shampoos marketed by these big companies like Loreal, Garnier, Pantene etc. all have the same basic chemicals, they just change the color and perfume, rename it and then launch a huge Ad campaign and sell millions till people realize its the same ol SH**.  I went back to my hydrating shampoo, but with two changes that seem to have helped my volume and thinning.  1. I now use a product to spray or massage onto the ends of my long hair to help protect it from sun damage and split ends during the day,(I am outside playing a lot of golf) and help to gently comb out the tangled split ends without pulling hairs out with my brush after I get out of the shower. I like two products for this so far, the Biolage leave-in-tonic, and another called Biosilk when my split ends are bad. 2. I picked up a Magic Wand massager several months back, on a lark, to try for my tennis elbow.  It does not seem to have had much effect on my tennis elbow, but I discovered it  leaves my scalp tingling after about 5 minutes.  That must help with the blood circulation a little, because my head itches less, and seems less dry.  I also am noticing my hair seems thicker the last few months because I am pulling less of it out when I brush thesplit ends with the tonic applied, and also less falling out because of the scalp massaging with the wand.  This makes sense to me because the products using Minoxidil really just dilate the blood vessels.  Hope this helps another old rock-star out there.  :)  leave a comment if you have a similar experience. I bought the Kerastase Volumactive Volumizing shampoo hoping to see the advertised results. I have normal hair strands, but they lack volume, so after trying this shampoo for 2 times, I could already see results: the hairs are fuller, and they seem healthier. I used to wash my hair every 3 days because it became oily, and now it lasts 1 week without seeing the greasy hairs.I use it in conjunction with its conditioner, so that may be a reason for such a big improvement in the way my hair looks and feels. It is recommended to change the shampoo every once in a while so the scalp/hair doesn't get used to the same environment/chemicals, but I intend to buy Kerastase products from now on. Great brand, products and results. I have fine hair and wash my hair everyday for the clean feeling and the volume. I used many drugstore shampoos and they all make the hair feel dry if you wash it every day. Kerastase doesn't. Even when you wash every day, doesn't feel dry. I also don't like using hair conditioner due to heavy feeling.I have been buying this shampoo on Amazon since years. The price is great. This size bottle will be enough for at least 6 months, so, not on the expensive side of the scale.Totally recommended, especially if you have fine hair. I love this product. It leaves my hair fuller and manageable",5,4,1

I personally use it on dry hair, for the days when my hair dries frizzy asf. A little bit of this and bam. Problem solved. Don't used to much though!!!! I'd been searching for a product to help my hair throughout the year when I came upon the Bed Head After Party Smoothing Cream. In the summer, my hair gets frizzy from the humidity, making me look like I stick my fingers in an electrical socket, and in the winter, it gets very dry and full of static during the cold, Wisconsin weather. No matter how many conditioners I tried, nothing worked. I started using I'd been looking for a product to add after my hair was dry, like a leave in conditioner but for dried hair. This is it. It calms crazy ends and adds a silky smooth softness. I recommend this product. Use a very small amount on ends. Too much can leave a greasy feel and look. A little goes a long way. It smells great and keeps frizzies away.However the last bottle I purchased through Amazon Bullard Bargains LLC... sent an oily mess. I used this for many years and at 18$ a bottle am disappointed how hard it is to return... I love Bed Head products and have used them for years. This was my first time using this specific product and I really like it. It leaves my hair smooth, soft and smelling great. I do think it's strange that the container looks like a sex toy. I love this for my hair.  I am not sure what they mean by stretch? I gave it five stars because I love the product. The packaging aggravates me.  I got this as a gift which is why I tried it. The bottle it comes in would deter me from buying it myself. But now that I  have tried it I can not go back to not using it. It looks like something else and I cannot understand why it can not be packaged in a better container.  Bright pink is ok.  My hair is less fizzy and does not look wet unless you put too much in your hair. My husband started using it and my daughter. But please change the look of the item. This is definitely a good price as it’s usually much pricier at the drug store. I took one star away because I feel like they have changed their formula over the years. It was originally intended to use in hair “after parties” to get the scent of smoke etc out of hair. Has great scent, and I use it as a finisher on from my mid length to ends to separate and shine. I will also scrunch my ends after using it which makes my not really curly hair curly. This is one of the several products my hair CAN NOT go without. I have used it for two decades now. I have very long thick hair for reference and it definitely smooths defrizzes and makes my hair less poofy. Great to make hair have that second day look. All around one of my favorite products I tried this when a product I was using got discontinued. I was thrilled to find this worked better! I have gray hair which can be dull and dry, I worked in a dab onto wet hair and blow dried. To my amazement my hair was soft and shiny, healthy looking! The most important thing is it’s not greasy and doesn’t weigh down your hair. Remember a little goes a long way. Love this product!",5,2,3

review love smooth finish glow,Moroccanoil Treatment Oil,"I have been using this hair care product for many years it really makes my hair feel smooth takes out my frizz and makes my hair more manageable the only downside to this particular time was I thought I was getting a bigger bottle of the Moroccan oil when it arrived it looked like a little travel size which I guess I should have paid attention to the details in the description of the product, But other than that this product has always been part of my hair care And will continue to be that way for a very long time to come highly recommend I've had loads of problems finding the right products for my wavy long hair.  I've tried many products, some quite expensive. The ones that claimed ""smooth"" or ""shiny"" left my hair limp and flat, and the ones claiming ""body"" and ""volume"" left it frizzy and unmanageable.  Then I read about Morrocanoil Treatment and decided to try it, and I can tell you it is a gamechanger! Finally, a product that is easy to use and leaves my hair shiny, soft, with lots of body, wavy and easy to curl and style.  And my husband even complimented me on how my hair smells! I was concerned it would make my hair greasy, but even though it feels a little oily on my hands before I put it on, it disappears into the hair once I apply it to my damp hair and comb it in. I use it daily, and a little bit goes a long way. I'll be using this product from now on! I have 4C African American hair and it’s 75% gray. With that being said I use this oil when I flat iron out my hair and on occasion when I’m natural. I just can’t use too much it will weigh my hair down. This product smells so great and makes my hair so soft. I put it in after brushing and before blow drying. My hair is only oily after using this if I put it on my scalp. Just use it half way down your head and you’ll be great! I'm new to using hair oils.  I had received a sample size of this product and loved it so much I came to Amazon to buy the full sized version.  I think this stuff smells amazing.  My husband is not so much a fan of the smell, but everyone is different.  I will continue to use this product because it smells fantastic to me, but also because it leaves my hair incredibly silky and smooth.  I have no issues at all with the pump.  I have fine, thin hair and this doesn't weigh my hair down at all or make it look greasy in any way. It kind of soaks right into your hair as soon as you apply it.  This stuff works great applying both before blow drying and after styling hair.  It also works great on the ends to tame any frizzy ends.  I usually use a pump full at a time that I warm up in between my hands by rubbing them together, and then I run it through my hair.  Any residual oil on your hands works great at softening your hands as well.  Very pricy product but a full sized bottle will hopefully last me a while. The Amazon page indicated that I would get my hair oil plus a new Moroccan body lotion, included for free. The page showed a photo of a nice bottle of body lotion with a pump dispenser. Well, that’s all that was - a photo. The bonus that I received with my hair oil was another photo of the bottle, but the actual body lotion came in one of those little trial packets. (See my photo) Still love the hair oil, though. I've used alot of beard oils and I initially bought this for my hair. However, this is the best product I have found so far for my beard. Manages and tames it, leaves it soft and no oily, greasy residue or unusual shine.The smell is neutral. Not overly feminine and is not overpowering. Classic product that does a great job.  The same product my high-end hairdresser uses.  Helps make my hair soft and manageable.",1,4,-3

Si el cabello se sigue partiendo pero tambien se que todo toma su tiempo. Great product. From wispy to Healthy hair It’s a little pricey on here but I can’t find it in the stores anymore, I use it daily and I love how it smells and strengthens my hair. The bottle is very small and the product finished before I start enjoying it. I used it as a moisturizer and conditioner for hair and scalp. I continue to buy this stuff! Makes my hair so soft and shiny, but not oily. And smells great! Arrived in a timely matter which I appreciated. After just 1 day of using I can tell a difference. I use Mane and Tail The Orginal shampoo and conditioner and combined with this leave in conditioner it’s unbelievable! My hair is so soft and tangle free , however the leave in conditioner does have a strong cough syrup smell at first to me it faded rather quickly so the smell isn’t too bad for me. Also for me it didn’t cause my hair to feel oily or sticky like some others experienced , my hair is completely soft in fact in feels like a fresh feeling to me , if that makes sense. My hair type is curly so it’s on th drier side so I’m not sure if that may have something to do with it. But I completely recommend this product!! I can wait to try more of Mane and Tail. Its helping my hair but I have thin fine hair so it leaves it a little oily looking. It is helping my hair thickness I believe after only a week.",1,5,-4

and curl without using a curling iron NA This is the fourth round brush I've owned and the absolute best as everyone else has indicated.  As someone else wrote, it holds but doesn't pull your hair.  The best part are the results - after trying this the first time, I bypassed the flat iron because my hair didn't need it - and I've had *serious* issues getting my hair to look healthy and nonfrizzy.  I have longer, blonde, color-treated hair that requires leave-in conditioner.  I use Redken Outshine as a leave-in with Redken Smooth Down for shine and smoothness.  The other round brushes I tried included one with natural bristles and 2 similar to this one - one broke when it was dropped and the other my hair got stuck in the seam.  None gave me the results that this one does.  In fact, I went to the salon to get my hair blown out after I received this brush.  The beautician used a different brush and the outcome was no where near as what I was able to do on my own - I went home and washed it and restyled it myself.  This brush is also lightweight.  I would never have guessed a hairbrush could make such a difference!  (I do not work for the company.)  This is well worth the $$. Prompt delivery, great product. My husband and I use this barrel style brush at least twice daily along with a pet brush on our two older kitties. Our talkative siamese mix meOWs for more brushing at their ""grooming perch."" We placed a mat on top of a hall cabinet. We trained our kitties by brushing them each time they're at their perch. Now they jump up with expectations and we groom them at that spot. The brush handle has a hole for hanging up and it sets above the perch along with the traditional pet brush and a lint (kitty fur removal from clothing!) brush. They LOVE this brush.  I like to brush in the opposite direction of their fur to pull up any loose fur and this works well.  It makes it easy to continue brushing as I turn the barrel (more fur to pick up, less stopping!). The style of this barrel brush also makes it easy to clean with my hand after use. The vacuum comes in handy to pull out the fur from the brush too. I absolutely love, love, love, this brush!  I have naturally curly hair and a lot of brushes get tangled in my hair.  Not this one!  I love that the metal part of the roll where the bristles come out, actually acts as a hair straightener.  What I mean by that is, when you are blow drying your hair, that center section of the brush warms up and brings heat to the hair to straighten it out as you are blow drying it. This keeps your hair soft and shiny versus drying it out with those hair straighteners that burn and dry out your hair.  If you blow dry your hair a lot, I would highly recommend this brush.  You will see an amazing difference from a standard hair straightener to this large roll brush.  You will never go back to straightener again once you see how much more healthier your hair actually looks from using this Cricket Technique Barrel Hair Brush. I read the reviews here about people getting fake Cricket brushes but never thought I would be one of those people but I was! I received my 2"" brush and it looked fine. After a few hours. I remembered to look at the handle as I saw photos here of real vs fake brush handles and sure enough, mine said ""antibacterial"" on the handle not antimicrobial as stated. It also said Centrix,not Cricket on the handle. I asked a rep for Cricket/Technique if my brush was authentic and she said that it should say antimicrobial on the handle and that she believed that my brush was not authentic. Sheeeesh! Amazon was great in dealing with the issue quickly and to my satisfaction but it's pretty upsetting to order something and get a knock off. I attached photos so you can see what my handle said. If yours says the same, it is not an authentic Cricket brush according to the Cricket rep I spoke to. Buyer beware!UPDATE: May 14, 2016: I received an email from someone who says that this brush is the real deal, just older stock. He commented twice above as well so you can read his comments. I am going by what the Cricket rep told me personally. I suggest that you get in touch with Cricket if you get a brush like mine to be sure it is just the old markings and not counterfeit. I really don't know what to think but I am updating to say that I am not sure at this point whether I got an old brush with old markings or a fake. Clearly the person who emailed me feels strongly that I am misleading people about the brush's authenticity. I would not do that. I went and am going by what I was personally told by a rep. I guess you will have to do a little digging and questioning if you get a brush like mine. I received a refund and have no desire to order another one at this point. This is the third round brush I have bought to blow out my hair. The first was Prego 275 and also a Remington Pearl Ceramic round brush. Both were ok.. or at least I thought until I received this brush the other day. I have thick, wavy, unruly shoulder  length hair that I have to blow straight and than flat iron. This brush did a wonderful job grabbing onto the hair and I didn't have to stop all the time to put my hair back on the brush. I normally work with at least two brushes but I just did my hair with just this one brush in half the time it normally takes me. I did order the two inch and it worked well for my shoulder length hair but I will be order at least one more of these brushes and I might try a different size to mix it up a little :) Also, this brush is noticeably heavier than my other two brushes. It felt good in my hands and didn't get heavy while styling my hair but that may be an issue for some.",5,5,0

This product imparts a nice rich sheen. My hair feels soft and well moisturized from roots to ends, even after using a blow dryer and flat iron. But it doesn't really thicken the hair. If looking for a serious hair thickener, you'll need to look further. This product does add some body. It won't make thin hair look thick, but it will give some body. I found what it really does...is leave the hair feeling and looking healthy and fortified.  The hair feels and looks stronger after using. It really conditions the hair.  It also smoothes and seal the hair shaft similar to the way those dimethicone hair polishers work, but without the greasy look and feel. I didn't use with the recommended Nexxus Volumizing Shampoo.  That may improve thickening result. I don't know.My hair is about 6"" long and I used a quarter sized amount. The conditioner has the consistency of a loose gel. It is not watery like some Leave In conditioners. No sticky or tacky feeling residue was left on my hair. It's not oil based, so there's nothing in it to weigh the hair down. From the result I got with this product, I highly recommend for anyone that has relaxed hair, and for wrapped styles, this conditioner really seals the hair shaft. Your wrapped style will look marvelous.  I only know how it works on relaxed hair, but I think this product will benefit anyone with frizzy fragile hair. People with already healthy hair may find this product helps maintain their hair's beauty. This conditioner is to be used for blow drying or drying naturally.It is the best Leave In conditioner I've ever used....and I've used a lot. I will definitely purchase again. I'm 20 years old and started experience hair loss after using the wrong kind of shampoo. I was using a shampoo for THICK hair - the same one I've been using since I was 14 or so and actually had thick hair. Through the crazy whirlwind that is life, I didn't really stop and look at my self image a little bit. Lamesauce, I know. But when I did, I realized I hadn't been taking care of myself very well and that I could see through the front part of my head into my scalp! The thick head of hair that once was now beginning to be the hair barely hanging on in whiffs. Thank god I decided to hit up Amazon and read reviews of hair thickening products. I ordered the Biotin Shampoo and this. This duo is better than Butch and Sundance, Phineas and Ferb, Batman and Robin, PB and J, all combined. The shampoo controls the frizz and adds essential nutrients to ensure the health of your scalp while the conditioner is actually tested and found out to be the best thickening product in the world- the most increase in diameter for your hair follicle. Look it up. Seriously. It's a combo you can't beat.FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS VERY CAREFULLY. Incredible result. I MEAN INCREDIBLE RESULTS. My hair is almost back to what it was when I was a 14 year old boy. Yeah. That's not a statement I would have said looking at my hair last week. It's been only a few days and right now you couldn't even tell I was once balding. Thank you Nexxus. This product is magic.All the best. Here's to not going bald! My hair has always been fine, hairspray just makes it wet unless I get one that does a fine mist for thin hair. I blow dry my hair almost everyday. For the last couple of years it has caused a big problem by giving me lots of breakage and splitends. Right after I used this product there was a big change. Odd thing for me to feel was my hair tucked behind my ear for the first time. It made it fuller right away and has stayed that way for the last two weeks with once daily use. I do not curl my hair so have no idea how it effects that. My hair is smoother with less frizzies and feels wonderful. The bottle came full with tape over the lid to keep it from leaking out. Hoping this product will help me grow my hair longer for the first time without it looking like a broken, dry mess. Bought it based on other reviewers. Thanks :) This conditioner will leave your hair looking fuller and has some of the same holding effects as gel, but it doesn't do much for the root of the problem (in my case, thinning hair). The conditioner hardens in your hair after a half hour or so, and after a ruffle of the crinkled hair, my hair does look more full and the style holds as if gel was used,I use it on nights out, but don't expect this shampoo to help with a thinning hairline long term. This Nexxus Headress Thickening Leave-In Volumizer seems to work well and does make my thinning hair appear to be more thick than it is however I wish that it was not  white in color as it takes time to dry on damp hair (I do not blow dry). If it was clear, I would not have the odd hour or so waiting for it to dry. Otherwise it does the trick for me and has a nice scent. I also feel good replacing my sculpting gel which was probably not so good for my scalp and hair with this more healthier conditioning option. I have very fine hair, I have a good amount but still very fine. I always have to use product to get any sort of volume. I have had this for about 2 weeks now and I use it every single day along with a root lifter by redken and my hair has a lot of natural looking body. It doesnt fall by the end of the day and it doesnt make my hair greasy or feel dirty. I use it maybe 1 or 2 days in a row before washing and the second day of wearing it my hair looks even more full. And its great that its only 15 dollars on amazon, I'm sure a product like this cost a bit more in stores. Thanks amazon! Nexus products are still #1 in my book for hair care.  This Thickening Leave-in Volumizer is fantastic!  It does exactly as it says it will, and leaves my hair looking and feeling soft, full of body and very touchable.  I have no problem styling my hair and it doesn't leave any residue on my appliances. This is one item both men and women will appreciate and once you start, you'll always want to have it on hand so it can be in your hair!",3,4,-1

The brush heads are soft and won't harshly scrape up against your scalp, which is great for comfort, especially if you struggle with dandruff like me. I prefer to use this brush right after the shower when my hair is wet, but it also works fine if your hair is dry. Just be aware that you may see different results.When I allow my hair to air dry after brushing it with this brush, my hair comes out wavier and more defined. On the other hand, brushing dry hair tends to make my hair frizzier.Overall, I would highly recommend this brush to anyone looking for a reliable and effective tool for styling their hair. Whether you're a man or a woman, the Denman Curly Hair Brush D3 is a must-have item for anyone with curly or wavy hair. It's comfortable, easy to use, and delivers amazing results every time. So, if you're looking for a top-quality hairbrush that won't disappoint, look no further than the Denman Curly Hair Brush D3! Darlings, the Denman Original Styler is a tool that every fashionista and beauty maven should have in their arsenal. It has been a staple in my own hair and makeup routine for years, and I must say, I am quite fond of it.The bristles are firm, but not too firm, and they glide through my tresses with ease. And the handle, oh the handle, is simply divine. It is ergonomically designed for maximum comfort and control, and I find that I am able to style my hair with greater precision and ease.However, I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the color selection. I was hoping for something a bit more vibrant, something that would truly make a statement. But alas, it seems that the Denman Original Styler is only available in black.In conclusion, the Denman Original Styler is a solid 4-star product. It is well-made, effective, and easy to use, but it lacks a certain je ne sais quoi that would have earned it a full five stars. Nevertheless, it is a tool that I would recommend to anyone in search of a reliable and versatile hairbrush. I was VERY apprehensive about spending this amount of money on a brush. I have one of those flexible silicone shower brushes, and thought that there was no way this could be worth it. After my first use, I was proven wrong. This gets rid of virtually all frizz, and makes my curls stand out so much. I have a much tighter curl in the back (3c/4a ish) vs the front (3b), and it also helps separate those out. It also gives me a tiny bit of volume at the root (something that I always struggle to get, usually it's just completely flat).Highly recommended. I LOVE this brush. (Also the plaid pattern is really cute) After hearing much hype about how Denmans destroy type 4 hair and living through the Era when everyone was cutting their denmans up to make them better suited to African descent hair, I was pleasantly surprised at how little tension this brush created in my hair.  I wear my hair stretched, a method that relies on tension created by either a roller, twist or braid but prefer to detangle and sleek out each section with a brush, then mold.  This brush was fantastic and not the horror so many make it out to be for African hair.  In fact, it somehow perfectly detangled my hair (fast) without creating tension despite the 9 rows in the brush!  At the end I was left relying more on the technique in my hands than on the drag of the brush to hold the hair straight.  I can NOT believe ppl were cutting up these brushes (removing three and four rows) to make them looser and wish I had taken the plunge to purchase one sooner.  Not my fave brush, I like to feel like I'm holding a small brick in my hands when I hold a brush (a holdover from when I used to break combs- the weight is more for security than purpose), but it feels like butter going through hair and it is steadily becoming my most used brush if not my fave.  And utility is WAY more important than personal preference.  The brush detangles beautifully, moves thick, thick hair creams with ease down the hair and really does dry hair faster (I had to redampen some sections as i detangle in wider sections than i twist). Light as a feather brush.  Strong teeth.  No peeling rubber or loose brush head after a full wash day.  No discomfort when in use.  Would definitely recommend. I have very curly hair and this brush is the only one i've ever owned that didn't SUCK to use on these loopy locks. I like to imagine that I now have the hair brushing experience that the straight-hairs get, and it's extremely satisfying.Likely will never buy a different brush, this is perfection. This brush pulled on my hair, which I didn't like. So, before I threw it away or put into bag with other disappointments, I removed 3 rows of combs, which made a big difference-no more snags. Been using with success. I like it. I have waist length hair and it very fine but thick. This brush is great for my hair. Doesn’t rip it out and I love the times on my scalp The brush worked well for curly hair. It is made to help your hair dry quickly.",5,4,1

product care great shopping experience,"Denman Hair Brush for Curly Hair D5 - Heavyweight 9 Row Classic Styling Brush for Styling – Detangling, Separating, Shaping and Defining Curls","Used for blow drying and styling. Excellent quality My mom and I love this brush, but I love it the most. I have thick, medium length 4B/C hair. This brush has weight and it is strong. I have used it every day since I received it earlier this week. I brush each quarter-section of my hair with it 50x, there is very little breakage and the brush itself is holding up fabulously. This is the first detangling brush that I have ever used that hasn't broken in my hair, even the bristles are still in perfect condition. I used it on my mom's hair too and she wants one. I am also buying a few to make care packages for my aunts. I tried looking for this same brush at my local beauty store tonight, and they had nothing by Denman. Not even the local Target, Walmart, Rite Aid, CVS, or Walgreens had it either. I love this brush and it is worth the price to have it. Just for the heck of it, I am getting an extra one for my use.Back to the use. Not only does the Denman Heavy Duty, 9-Row Styling brush successfully detangle my hair, but I have seen less breakage and hair loss using it these last few days than any comb or brush I have used before. The massage it gives my scalp is invigorating and delightful,. I continue to feel the tingling sensations for 30-60 minutes after. The design evenly distributes oil to every strand of hair, and the strong-non scratchy- bristles uplift any dandruff from the scalp, relieving itching. After using, my hair is SO much easier to manage. I'm between hair styles right now, so I am just safety braiding my hair in quarters at night after scalp treating, hair conditioning, and brushing.If brushing my hair and braiding it every night will make it grow longer, I will do it as long as this brush continues to be manufactured. My goal is to grow my hair past my shoulder blades. Right now, it reaches a little more than half way down the back of my neck.  Thanks to my current hair products (Fantasia Naturals Tea Tree Oil line, and an essential oil mixture (Tea Tree Oil, Peppermint Oil, Aloe Vera Oil) with a Fractionated Coconut Oil base) and this brush, I have found myself needing to wash my hair less and less. I used to have to wash it once or twice a week due to excessive dandruff and itching (drying the hair strands and my scalp excessively), now I have been able to reduce it to once a month and my hair stays clean. My hair has never been healthier and I am seeing less split ends. Thanks to this brush, I don't need combs for anything other than making parts. I am so glad I will never see a 3"" hair ball again. I have extremely thick 3C Curly hair and it’s very very long and was becoming problematic to brush out. For my hair routine I brush in the shower while rinsing conditioner to de tangle it and then I brush my hair as I put product in outside of the shower.I really love what this brush does to my curls. No other brush has made my curls more defined and beautiful than this brush. That being said I have one complaint about a feature I understand why they put it… the part with the bristles slides out so that it can easily be cleaned. And while that’s great and all, because my hair is so long, I cannot hold the brush horizontal the entire time I brush my hair. And because my hair is very thick, it clings to the brush and unless I am holding to top part of the brush so the bristles don’t slide out, it was get stuck in my hair (not hard to remove though) and the handle will become detached from the bristles.I’m sure there is a brush out there similar where you can’t slide out the bristles but I did not realize when I ordered this that it could do that. I thought I broke it at first. If your hair is past 3C I would not recommend this brush at all. You will get frustrated with how much the bristles slide out, it would be nice if there was some kind of lock and unlock feature for it. Su diseño es el indicado para moldear el cabello rizado. El mango de agarre es excelente y el peso del cepillo acorde a su funcionalidad. Great quality, easy to clean and leaves your hair looking great. I am very happy with this purchase. I have very thick hair and when it's wet it's thicker and curlier and tangles easily. I bought this brush to detangle after I wash my hair. This brush detangled my wet hair with very little shedding. I usually straighten my hair but I noticed as I was detangling how well this brush defined my curls. This is a great brush! This Denman brush is absolutely awesome for detangling multi-textured afro hair, and any hair texture less curly than that. The Denman brushes I have purchased have worked better than any others I have used for this in the past. No beat-up, bent bristles from all my hairstyling abuse. Lol. However, with this new brush I more recently received, it appears as though they've changed the plastic that the handle was made from, and it seems to be a bit more fragile than the one I had before it. They've also updated the shape of it. In my inescapable clumsiness, and with slippery products on my hands, I dropped the brush on the hard, tile floor twice within the first week and a half of using it, and it, now, has this huge crack on the back of it from hitting the floor in the same spot (see photo). I am purchasing another one, just in case that crack decides to get any bigger. It isn't moving down any further, at least, but it is widening on the top the more that I use the brush. Btw, the gold logo on the back was there when I received it, but washed right off in the shower, hence the reason for its absence in the photo.Confound it, Denman! Why did you make such a fantastic, yet fragile ""heavyweight"" product? I am purchasing another one, because I love how well the brush does its job. I will just make sure I have an unreasonably firm grip on the handle while using it to prevent this from happening again. It said ""heavyweight,"" yes, but this apparently did not mean ""unbreakable."" It can take on death-defying feats like getting the tangles out of my unruly ""wool,"" but I guess the ""heavyweight"" part would only apply to the fact that it doesn't feel like a feather in the hand.Anyway, this brush works like a dream, but treat it like porcelain. Hopefully, the designers will return to the drawing board and, next time, use a plastic material that is a little sturdier and more suited for this application.",5,5,0

stuff no problem got tired reading great review finally ordered best natural curly thin hair always use conditioner left hair tame frizz time leaf heavy 10 miracle hair,"It's a 10 Haircare Miracle Leave-In product, 4 fl. oz.","I started my curly journey like 4 years ago and always saw this as a highly recommended product but I just always thought “I don’t need it” but a stylist recently used it on me and I loved the product. Will def buy again. I absolutely love this product.....I have short hair so I use a dime size amount and it helps me style my hair and the style last longer! It leaves my hair soft and helps with any frizz that I might have. I have curly, coarse hair and need a frizz-reducing product every day.  I tried this and was thrilled at how great it worked.  Just like anything that works good, it's expensive. Hair was knotting and breaking off.  This helps with the process. It conditions my hair and smells nice, but my hair is not silky smooth like I was expecting. It worked, just not miraculously - and I need a LOT. I have dry, coarse hair for reference. I will not be repurchasing, purely because of the price. some background on my hair: I have naturally dark blond hair that falls about half way down my back. it has a slight natural wave (naturally it will dry at an ugly intermediate between straight & wavy). it has a moderate amount of damage from heat styling and wearing in ponytails/buns.  my hair is about average thickness, but because it's so long it can look thin because it gets weighed down by the length. prior to this product I was using a detangler, a shine/anti-frizz serum (frizz-ease or similar), mousse, and about half the time I used a voluminizer/thickener by redken. I also use specific redken heat styling products depending on whether I curl or straighten. My review is based on using only It's a 10 (unless otherwise noted).PROS:- Since using it I have gone from having a TON of static in my hair to having none- I didn't think I would like a spray on product, I thought it would be hard to evenly coat my hair without using too much, but I haven't had any problems- Light, nice smell. Other people have commented that they found the scent overpowering, but I have not experienced that at all. After I'm done blow drying my hair I never notice the smell again.- Good detangler.  My hair gets knotted easily. It's a 10 is enough to detangle the every day knots I get when I get out of the shower. For serious knots (like I haven't brushed my hair in a couple days or I teased it) I still use my Mane & Tail detangler. a TON of people commented on it's detangling ability.... if you are buying this product primarily as a detangler, save your money and buy something at the drug store. but if you are buying it to replace something like frizz-ease (which I am), it is more than adequate. (it detangles better than any serum I've used, like frizz-ease, coconut milk serum, etc.)- It doesn't weigh my hair down. It gives me more body than I would get with frizz-ease + mousse alone. HOWEVER, it does not work as well as my voluminizer does, and It's a 10 doesn't seem to play well with other products. I am obsessed with my redken voluminizer and it ALWAYS works for me...however when I used it along with It's a 10 my hair ended up flatter than it was before. weird.- I don't have a huge frizz problem, but my hair does seem to look more polished at the end of the day than before I started using this product.- when using this, my hair feels a lot cleaner than when I use a combination of other products. I like to wash/dry my hair at night, and then just do some touch-ups in the morning. When I use It's a 10, I still have to do minor touch-ups in the morning, like smoothing/straightening pieces that got weird from the way I slept on them, but the overall feel of my hair is the exact same as the night before. It still feels freshly washed.BORDERLINE:- I don't notice that my hair is more or less shiny. This isn't a huge deal for me though. If are looking to really increase your shine, I would stick with a regular old shine spray.CONS:- though I don't have much frizz, I do have some broken hairs that stick up/out, especially around my part. This doesn't really take care of them as well as a mousse or gel would. It just doesn't have the kind of hold that other products have. However, I use a light spray hairspray and smooth the broken hairs down & it pretty much takes care of the problem- my hair naturally has a bit of wave, and usually has no problem holding a curl. but when It's a 10 is in my hair any curl or wave I put in my hair completely falls flat, even when using my redken starch spray (which can usually make curls last for days) & hair spray. If you have curly hair that you want to be straighter this would probably be a plus for you, but I like to add a little curl/body to my hair and this really prevents me from doing it.- this is a minor issue, but I don't like the opaque bottle. I like to be able to see how much product I have left.I will continue using this product. However, I will still keep my old products stocked. Not being able to use voluminizer or curl my hair with this product is a really big downside to me. But I can't deny that it makes my hair feel great.UPDATE: after several months of use, I haven't noticed any improvement in my hair's condition. In fact, I find I have a lot more broken hairs. There are a ton of factors that contribute to hair's health, so I can't say that this product caused the breakage, but it definitely didn't stop it from happening. Though it lists heat protection as one of it's uses, I don't think it does much to protect against heat damage. From the start, I stilled used a Redken heat spray when I straightened my hair, but I stopped using a heat spray for blow-drying. I am pretty convinced that's why my hair has become damaged and I've gone back to using my thermal protectant for both drying and straightening.  Also, now that we've had some hot & muggy days I can comment on it's frizz-fighting ability. For me, it did NOTHING to fight my hair's frizz. I can't remember the last time my hair got was so frizzy. It looked like I had absolutely nothing in my hair and went for a run on a hot and rainy day. Really, I just sat in a classroom all day. I received this product in my FitFabFun kit.  I was on vacation and after several days in the hot sun, my hair was extremely dry.  I had packed this leave in conditioner as I wanted to give it a try and so glad I did.  I washed my hair, let it dry and then put this leave in conditioner on my hair and left it in all night.  In the morning I shampooed and my hair was so soft and stayed that way for weeks.  This is my regular routine now when I feel my hair getting dry.  Love this product.  Thank You FitFabFun for sending it to me and Amazon for carrying it. Left my hair moisturised and silky",2,5,-3

Like down to my lower back. This hair claw can hold all my hair up. However, it is heavy and it kinda digs into my scalp. You have to use it like from the top, teeth pointing downwards holding a bun to be comfortable. The clip holds my hair very well and I have a lot of hair! Most other clips don't work or I have to manipulate the hair in such a way that it holds but not all of it is in the clip. With this clip I can just clip the hair and go. What I don't like about the clip though is that it sticks out very far from my head. It is situated in such a way that the clip is super deep instead of wide so if I place it straight into my twisted hair in the back of my head it sticks straight out from the back of my head the total depth of the clip which is about 3 inches. You can't sit back in a car seat with a headrest that is high but that is true for many clips. Some of the other Scunci clips are more wide than deep though which sit better on the head (although they don't hold as much hair). It is possible to ""insert"" it into your hair sideways but it is not as effective. For this reason only I gave it four instead of five stars. OBSESSED wit this clip. It’s huge, can hold my long curly hair, and is comfortable when I wear it for a long period of time. It’s definitely huge. I have curly hair that comes to my waist and I like to twist it up and put it in a bun. I needed something to hold that bun in place tight all day. This clip has the length to hold all my hair together but it lacks in strength. It gets lose and my buns starts yo slowly migrate south then threads of hair fall out. The grabing part also scratches my scalp. It needs to be a little more curved towards the end. I had high hopes for this huge clip but I think it’s just for at home when you want to hold not-yet-quite-dry hair while you do your make up. Will not be my everyday/all day bun holder for sure. I have super thick wavy hair that most normal ""large"" clips just laugh at. And by that, I mean there is NO way on earth they will hold all of my hair (even just pulling up the sides and clasping in the back) and if they do manage it, they likely break soon thereafter. Octopus clips? No. Basic jaw clips? Never. I have my favorite clips I used to only find at Claire's (!) but I can't even find them there anymore, so when I saw this one, I had to try it. Besides, this one is much cooler and stylish than the ones I was getting at the mall!And ho-leeee cow they aren't lying when they say this thing is XXX Large! Just looking at it I actually thought it might be too big for my hair--and I'll be damned--it pretty much is! Just pulling up the sides like I mentioned before? The clip is WAY too big! If I use it to grab my entire ponytail in a twist it kinda fits--but is still almost too big!So, needless to say, this isn't quite the clip for me...the description says it will hold any amount of hair, which isn't technically the case since my thick hair wasn't quite thick enough...but I'll overlook that and give it five stars because it is the only clip I've ever found that will hold more hair than I have!Since I've been in your place--trying to buy a clip pretty much ""sight unseen"" over the internet--I tried to upload a bunch of photos so you can get an idea of what this clip is like before you buy it. The actual size appears to be quite similar to my favorite clip (the gold one in the photos) but the XXL clip just holds SO MUCH MORE hair. I bought this because it claimed to hold even the thickest hair. I have long, THICK, curly brown hair that stops at my waistline and I had a hard time maneuvering this clip. It wouldn't stay in well but I like how it looks overall. Don't expect this to hold all of your hair! I’m really not sure what other people are saying, or how they’re saying it doesn’t hold a lot of hair, because I have so much hair and this clip is the only one that has ever done the job without me breaking my back to get all my hair collected. I usually don’t comment on things like this but, it’s just blowing my mind that there are people on here saying it doesn’t hold a lot of hair. I can’t find anything like this on the market. Maybe we do all have different hair, but I think the people who are searching for this product probably have a lot of hair. My hair is thick and naturally wavy straight, for reference.The only thing I don’t like is that it doesn’t come in more colors. 5 stars! If you are looking for a nice strong grip this one is for you, if you don't like having a big piece of plastic protruding from your head I would suggest you pass on this one,i tried using it several different Ways I have waist length hair and it looked odd when I pulled it up in the clip.",1,3,-2

(Packaging May Vary)","Nice fragrance. The product leaves fine hair feeling light and lovely. I do agree with another review that the manufacturer definitely needs to start taping the flip up lids so that during shipment the contents don’t leak out. My order had partially leaked during shipment and a simple piece of clear tape would’ve prevented that. I used to purchase this product a long time ago elsewhere before the present company bought Jason Naturals. I hope they didn’t cheapen the current product by cheapening ingredients or removing beneficial ones.  I’m hoping to continue purchasing and using the shampoos if desired results are observed. Leaves my hair very soft but was hoping to feel more thickness since hair is so thin. I will purchase again tho Product is great.  Shipping, packaging, and the such on the part of AZ is a joke.  Seriously folks?!!!?!!!! The top on a plastic unsealed bottle is not taped down??  This is not a difficult concept to grasp.  These tops unscrew themselves in the shipping process. (like the phenomenon of wearing two necklaces and they intertwine with one another.)I'll continue using and repurchase, I just won't order from this clown operation.  How they have become the monster they have is NOT through quality/integrity shipping practices. LOL. The first time I bought this shampoo, it was so hard to lather up I felt like I was pulling out more hairs than saving them. Then they came out with this formula and I gave it a try.Finally it lathers up quickly the first time you apply it. If you're especially grimy and need a second application, it lathers up even better and faster. No more struggling to get this stuff to clean your hair to give it volume and thickness.The old formula was so heavy that even after using 2  applications, by the next day my hair was oily looking. Now after 24 hours it still looks clean and fuller. I tried using it with Love the shampoo but EVERY bottle I've purchased...the lid was loose and some of the shampoo leaked out.  I'd hate to switch but WHAT A WASTE.  It would be so simple to secure the lid more tightly!!! I have thin hair but this product gave me a lot of volume. The shampoo and conditioner needs to be used together for best results. *Disclaimer* Feel free to look me up on here.  I've reviewed some other random stuff that I've purchased.  I give you my word as a decent human being that I did purchase this product and that I have used it and these are my real thoughts.  May all who intentionally mislead others, in the hope of making money, have more hair than they know what to do with...on their butts.I like this stuff a lot.  I personally feel like I see a difference when I use this as opposed to a regular shampoo.  I think I have better scalp coverage in the front and it just looks like I have more hair.  Now I'm a male and I have thin hair that is definitely receding at my temples.  I used to call it a widow's peak but then I looked up what the actually was and now I'd like to apologize to all widow's peakers out there;  You have lots of hair and my thing is not to be confused with yours.A bottle has lasted me about 4 months I think.  I use about a nickel-sized amount and work it through.  Females or males with longer hair will obviously need a bit more.  I let it sit for a solid 30 count (""one-banana, two-banana"") and then rinse.  JASON is a solid company that has been around for a while.  I will re-order. this does add volume to hair for a day or two after using.",5,4,1

Curling Custard Natural Styling Gel 16 oz,"I struggled with learning how to use this product but I kept coming back to it for 2 reasons: no product lasts as long and this product has a ph of about 4.5 which is critical for those of us African Americans with 4c high porosity hair. Google and research the importance of ph and porous hair.  Lower ph products flatten hair cuticles making it harder for moisture to escape thus keeping your hair mosturized longer.  Also, cuticles that are flattened are not as easily damaged as raised cuticles. High ph products raise your cuticles increasing the chances of dry, damaged hair. I finally found the trick to make this product work. Put this product on freshly washed hair (your hair does not have to be soaking wet) and put your leave in under the custard and on top of it. Use a very moisturizing leave in or oil (find out what works best for you. I use jojoba oil mixed with a little vegetable glycerin or sometimes I use Oyin Hair Dew although lately I have been using Elasta QP Olive Oil & Mango Butter Curl Defining pudding as a leave in because it has a low ph and does contain silicones which do not bother me because silicones give hair body and great frizz control you just have to use a clarifying shampoo). Again, the key is to use this product on freshly washed hair and to put a low ph moisturizing leave in on under the custard and on top of it. If you find the custard too thick, goopy, and hard to distribute on your hair mix with a little water.  I mix with seltzer water (not club soda or tonic water) because seltzer water has a low ph.  Refresh everyday by spritzing with a little  seltzer water or seltzer water with a little of your favorite oil mixed in or running a little bit of your favorite oil or leave in in your hair (experiment to see which works better for you) and your wash and go should be good for  at least 5 to 7 days if not longer.4c high porosity naturals do not use Knot Today leave in.  Knot Today is a good detangler because it contains behentrimonium methosolate (also google this) but it is not very moisturizing and has a high ph between 7 and 8.  A better leave in to use is Oyin Hair Dew which also contains behentrimonium methosulfate but is way more moisturizing and has a ph of 4.5.This is a great product when used how I just explained.  Also, all Ecostyler gels have a high ph.  Again, Google why the ph of hair products is important.08/13/18 Update - I always get great wash and gos with this product but I just got my best wash and go  today using a couple of tablespoons of coconut milk from a can (without guar gum) mixed a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and a little seltzer water to lower the ph of the coconut milk on freshly washed towel dried hair. (Side Note - If your wash and go lacks volume coconut milk not coconut oil will definitely add volume but do not use more than 2 to 3 days in a row as a leave in because it can make her a little gunky but it is great for volume and all natural) I then put the kinky curly custard on my hair.  I then put the the Elasta QP Pudding on top.  I got one of my best wash and gos.  Again, the key is a good leave in under and also over kinky curly custard. It your job to find the right leave in for you.  Just make sure the ph is between 4.5 to 5.5Update - 02/01/19 I am really liking a little sesame oil mixed with a low ph water to refresh my wash and go every money.  It adds body and is not a greasy as your average oil.  It it considered a drying oil.  To me it seems like it penetrates into your.  A commonly used oil for hair in India  Unfortunately it is very stinky so you have to spend a little more to buy unscented sesame oil.Update 06/17/19 Ok I found out why my hair liked sesame oil it is because it is high in ceramides.  Well now I am using safflower oil which is even higher in ceramides and has no scent.  Whenever possible get unrefined oils. You won't get the same benefits with refined oils.  Oils high in ceramides is only way to go for me.  Please Google oils high in ceramides and educate yourself on the benefits. If you want to have some curl definition this is the way to go, for sure. Since most people have written the same thing, here's what I would add in terms of my routine to help you deal with the annoyance of getting out of your shower with completely wet hair dripping all around you before and after you apply the product: (I have short hair, about 2-3 inches on top, half of that on the sides)First thing i do is wash my hair with shampoo and run my hands through my hair a few time to kind of ""ring"" the excess water out of it after rinsing the shampoo out. After I do that, I do my shower routine, trying to not get additional water in my hair.After i'm done showering, shaving, singing and whatever else one does in the shower, I proceed to add the kinky-curly knot today leave-in conditioner, applying it most to where my hair is longer and then i work my way to the shorter sides of my head. I then add a little bit of the Curly Custard (if i had to measure it, i'd say it would be about one tablespoon or slightly less). I first work it on my palms (as you would do with lotion- I find this helps avoid clumps in my hair) and then apply it the same way I did with the Leave-in conditioner. I find that if i wait until the end of my shower to apply the products, the excess water is gone, but my hair is sufficiently wet to still take the product in the manner in which it is intended.Now, the secret to having this product work and look wonderfully the entire day in your hair (at least for me) especially after it dries out, because as others have noted, it will get really hard once your hair dries, is by adding a tiny bit of greasy to your hair. Yes, sounds a bit weird, but that's what it is. I use this grease made by a tiny company in upstate NY, called Wosa Indian Hemp Grease. Once my hair dries, I put a small amount, about the size of a nickel (given my length) and the curls get softer and a little bouncier, and they look even better as the days gets going - once your hair has had time to absorb the grease. This particular grease is not very heavy on my hair since i use just a tiny bit. I have tried doing the same with oil (coconut), but I never get the same effect. Hope this helps.",4,2,2

find great detangler for my daughters 4c hair. We keep coming back to this one as we try out others too. My granddaughter has VERY curly hair that tangles easily. This stuff works! My daughter is 8 years old and has hair past her waist. Her hair is thick with slight wave with some little curls around her hairline. She has A LOT of hair, (think Arianna Grande's ponytail).I was struggling with her getting horrible knots and the ends drying out. The other problem was her getting frizz and flyaways hairs all over her head.(Sidenote: I really want to cut her hair short but she loves it long and it means a lot to her that shes got the longest hair at school. But for real shes getting her hair cut sooner than she knows!!)I graduated cosmetology school so I know a lot about hair and maintenance, her hair is high maintenance (highly porous, dry, plus damage from pool water and being slept on wet).I've tried a variety of high end and expensive leave in conditioners, shampoos and conditioners, oils, creams, treatments...Her hair is my biggest challenge.Kinky Curly Knot Today has tamed her wild hair! It has made the hairs around her crown area smoothed but not matted down. The mid-shaft to the ends look and feel nourished and moisturized. Her hair does feel a bit heavier, and I'm pretty sure its because it's now got the moisture she needs and with the volume of hair she has, it will make a considerable difference.I also love that the price is so reasonable! It's worth every penny since it reduces my workload on her hair, and cuts out the need for me to buy a lot of products that just arent working for us.My local beauty supply store doesnt carry the Kinky Curly line so I'm glad I can get it here.Oh, as for how I apply it, after washing and conditioning, I apply Kinky Curly Knot Today liberally through her midshaft down to her ends and proceed to gently detangle that areas applied.Then I drag some of the product on the comb through her hair base (the top of her head) I dont add a lot of concentrated product on her scalp as it will build up quickly and weigh down her already heavy hair.Then I put her hair in a low loose braid to air dry as long as possible. Then, when her hair is slightly damp, I will use a medium heat hair drier to move her hair around and loosen up the bulkier damp spots, not going for bone dry, just lightly speeding up the drying process. Her finished hair looks amazing. Like beautiful mermaid waves.I do straighten her hair sometimes but avoid it to keep the damage down. I LOVE this product. It makes my hair feel so soft and detangled. Todo me agrada I have been using this product for over 10 years.  I am stoked to find it on Amazon - recently made my first online purchase.  Previously I had to drive to the salon supply store every time.  This is the primary product I use on my mid back length curly hair.  I occasionally add other products but as a day to day only this one.  I put a generous amount all over my hair straight out of the shower and on days I don't wet or wash my hair I spritz some water on my hair and hands over the sink and add a small amount to my slightly moistened dry hair to refresh the curl.  If I do not put this product in my hair it is very frizzy with little curl definition.  That being said I use this every single day and have beautiful curl definition.  I am frequently asked by other curly hair women and men what I use and I always give the recommendation.  Life changer.  It is also light so it doesn't weigh down hair, no stickiness or stiffness.  Leaves hair completely soft and malleable.  The scent is delicate, not overpowering at all and seems to evaporate away quickly.  I have tried some other kinky products over the years with much stronger scents which is too much for me. I will try my best to describe my hair. I am a White American, my natural hair color is Auburn, naturally curly underneath and straight on top, coarse as a horses tail (extremely dry and coarse),  my hair is extremely heavy (no way will bobby pins hold my hair up), takes me at least an hour to brush-out the tangles in my hair because as fast as I can brush out a section the rest of my hair starts to dry and curl-up.It is nothing for me to use a half of a bottle of conditioner so that I won't have to suffer trying to comb through it.  I have bought every product on the market and even the ""As Seen On TV"" expensive product that automatically charges your account every month.  Nothing has worked until now.  I HIGHLY recommend this product. After reading other reviews this is how I used this product: After showering I ringed out my hair of excess water then then took a quarter size amount of the product in my hands and smeared between both hands and applied to my wet hair. I did this same amount twice (I have slightly below shoulder length hair). I was shocked. My big tooth comb went right through my hair. No tears and frustration of yanking out my hair trying to comb through. I then let my hair air dry and it kept a very soft curl. that lasted all night. I'm sold on this product. No more using a half of a bottle of product,  yanking out hand fulls of hair, styling time cut in over half, and my hair no longer feels like a horses tail, now it feels healthy. Deja el pelo sedoso pero para mí tipo de cuero cabelludo no va bien, me da caspa, debo lavarlo al siguiente día",1,4,-3

come eventually,"L'Oreal Paris Feria Multi-Faceted Shimmering Permanent Hair Color, 36 Deep Burgundy Brown, Hair Dye","This review is long, but if you're truly interested in this color and worried about how it may take to treated hair (which I was, I had to hunt for a review on hair that was already bleached before and it was still much darker than mine) then I promise it's worth it!! A briefer review for people who do not care: good product, I found it easy to use (I put all of the steps into a bowl and used a mix of both a brush and my hands), it is messy!! I thought that was just some people being unprepared for how messy hair dye is, but it is a very thin formula that can splatter so easily. There are warnings on the top of the box when you open it to make sure you get all of the product out from each thing, and I did exactly that, so the end result (it was on for a bit longer than 25 minutes, maybe 45 at the most) is the two reds. One is wet, one is dry. I can't say anything about how long it lasts, because I don't really mind having to touch up that much, but do put a towel over your pillow for the first couple days after dyeing.Okay, so I've been bleaching and coloring my own hair at home (with help when needed) for about two years now, and I don't really use box dyes because I love the bright colors of Manic Panic dyes. I tried them for one color and it became my go-to. I've wanted to go to a dark red for a good while, but Manic Panic doesn't have any colors like that that I thought were close to what I wanted. If your end color goal is Lee Chaeryeong from ITZY (when she had red hair), stick with me because that was my goal, and I actually feel pretty happy with the result. My biggest concern when looking for a dye was the fact that box dye is kind of meant to be visible over dark hair. I have light hair, and I didn't want it to be super bright when that wasn't what my goal was. I'm literally ONLY leaving this review because of the fact that I couldn't find ANY that were over pre-treated hair! I found one YouTube review and I decided that that was my sign, so over two days I got the pink out of my hair and dyed it. If you're just looking to see if it'll work over bleached hair, it works perfectly fine (I'm pretty sure, my starting hair wasn't exactly blonde but it was light enough that I am so, so sure it'll work fine), but I did accidentally leave it on for a little more than the instructions say to! Okay, if you're still reading this (honestly I know nobody is but I do not care) and have a bright color you're changing from, this is what I'm here for. So I started with that bright pink in the picture where my face is halfway in frame, and then I tried some at-home color removal tricks to see if they would help; they didn't, so I resorted to shampooing two, maybe three times for long periods and rinsed with hot water. That's where you get to the pictures where I'm holding up the front and then showing the back- not good pictures, but you get the idea. The pink was clinging to the front pieces of my hair, but it had rinsed fine everywhere else, so the last stage of getting my hair prepped to have a dark (and not pinky) red was to use toner on my whole head. I actually don't remember what level of the Wella toner I used, but I think it was either a) exactly the one that people recommend online for blonde, or b) something really close. I left that on for the correct amount of time and rinsed with some still-pink and mostly kind of purple and grey toned hair, which was good enough for me because I just wanted no yellow undertones if possible. That picture is the one where my hair is almost purple and silver. The next two are the results, the wet hair is right after I finished getting the dye out of my hair and the dry one is right after waking up. I KNOW that that was a LOT, but I really need a lot of guidance myself, so if I can kind of help anyone else like that I'd like to try. OK bye Feria is one of the best to use, love the Metallics and Power Reds in all the brands that they are coming out with now like GOT2B which is an excellent brand too and the comparable color would be their 'Dark Ruby'. The Feria R48 is one of my core power colors, I love it. I color it this color a few times a year as I change my hair color around almost every time I color between the purples/violets and reds. Color lasts a long time as long as you use a color safe shampoo and conditioner to preserve it. Kit is glamourous with fancy black salon like gloves to color your hair with. Lots of fun and high quality product, plus they give you both shampoo and conditioner with the box kit. I've been dying my hair red for just about 10 years and have used quite a few brands. By far this is my favorite brand and R68 is my favorite of the reds. It's super bright and fun.Scentwise, it has a perfume so the harshness of the chemical smell is nullified. It's super easy to mix and use. I usually do 2 go thrus to hit the grays around my temples though.It definitely lasts a decent amount of time, moreso if you don't wash your hair daily and use color-safe shampoo. I tried out a professionally dyed red at a salon and was super bummed how quick it faded compared to Feria. It also fades very nicely on my medium brown hair so if I dilly dally in dyeing it it looks okay. FÉRIA is a fantastic box color!I have used their box colors for years literally...especially whilst mixing 2 of their reds together at the same time. I highly recommend this specific box color, don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise...their reds are STUNNING, super lux and ultra glossy! When I use box color, this is the ONLY brand I use and my hair is in excellent condition. I am an avid admirer of this particular brand of box color.Note:Note: Keep this in your hair product arsenal always! 🤙😊 I will start off by saying I’m very happy with the products it all comes with and my hair feels very soft and bouncy however the color did not come out as red as I hoped. I didn’t bleach my hair so I wasn’t expecting much but on the box is did have different dark hair options with how the color would turn out. I do really like the color and im definitely going to try again. I did purchase 2 boxes because I have thick hair and I used both boxes. I dyed my hair with this hair dye and it’s been 2 months already and I’m STILL washing it out of my hair. Honestly this is by far the best drugstore hair dye I ever used when I first dyed it it was a really pretty red kinda like cherry idk it was good I’m definitely gonna use it again. I love red hair. And I am deep into retirement age and I still love vibrant red. This is such an easy product to use and especially healthy for my hair. I get so many compliments almost daily about my hair and the color. And I tell everyone that it is L’Oreal and I tell them the number of the brand. And it leaves my hair soft and well condition. It comes with everything you would ever need. Including the gloves, the instructions, the red enhancer booster, the dye, the developer conditioner, and shampoo it is such a bargain in a box. I have skipped the hundred dollar salon coloring, and I do my own. I have been using it for years and I love it. I re-order it every single month. Nothing compares to this product for red. It made my hair more of an auburn-burgundy color. Which I’m not dissatisfied with, but it definitely isn’t like the box, and not as bright either . I was hoping I didn’t have to lift my hair with this brand, but it seems that I will have to.",3,4,-1

purchased this back in Aug '08 from Amazon and I have finally gotten around to writing a review and it is definitely positive.  This replaced my old Vidal Sassoon which had lasted years but the screen got loose and caught in the fan and it was done.  I searched and finally settled on this.  I couldn't believe that it actually DID dry my hair faster like the other reviews had said, and also without feeling like my hair is frying and, remarkably, it does feel quite soft compared to my old dryer.  My hair is medium to long and extremely thick (fine hair but a lot of it) so it still is amazing how fast this dries my hair- </= 5 minutes. I never thought I'd care about that cold blast shot but it has come so handy as I do use hot rollers quite often.  This is also the quietest hair dryer I've ever had.  A lower softer rumble from my old one.  I loved this hair dryer so much, when I saw the same model on sale at a local drug store chain later that year, I bought one for our family's weekend place.  That's when I noticed a HUGE difference.  The second one I bought was very loud, and sounded like it was working too hard.  I called the manufacturer and they couldn't explain it.  That's when my husband and I looked at both and noticed that the one I bought from Amazon had 4 FAN BLADES and the one I bought from the drug store had 7 FAN BLADES.  The customer service rep said that isn't the reason why it sounded so bad but my husband and I were convinced and my husband is an engineer.  So, I went back to the drug store and found one out of the bunch that had the 4 FAN BLADES.  Voila!  It works as wonderfully as the first one I bought.  So, my advice is:Be sure to get the one with 4 FAN BLADES.  I don't know how you'd do that with Amazon, though.  I strongly feel there is a remarkable difference in loudness and performance.  This is an excellent hair dryer with the 4 fan blades.  It's still going strong over two years later with daily use.  The second one I bought isn't used as often but is in same excellent condition.UPDATE 1/8/11- thumbs down!It seems I jinxed myself writing the above glowing review.  My hairdryer is slowly dying.  Its GFI plug kept tripping a couple of days and now my dryer is running on a low speed while on the high switch, the low switch is barely running at all.  Still have heat, hair is still drying but obviously I need a new dryer.  I just read a recent review on here that says she experienced the same problem, but within a matter of 2 months.  My dryer got a little over 2 years.  It was a great dryer but now if it is as claimed by the other reviewer that this is a common problem of it tripping and motor dying, I cannot really give a good review considering my old Vidal Sassoon lasted many years, if not for the loosened fan screen getting caught in the blades and ruining it.Update 2/28/20After all the ups and downs with this dryer, it is finished as of today.  It worked full power for its remaining time, once in a while it tripped and I'd have to reset but it never weakened again.  And the reason why it died is because the extension cord I had it plugged into had a fray which I ignored and it exploded and shorted and so my hair dryer kept slowing and shutting down thereafter.  I think it would have lasted even more if not for that.  My husband tried to repair it, but had trouble with the silver solder and melted the plastic switch.  It would have kept going.  It's hard to believe the dryer has lasted this long.  I actually had gotten two more of these that aren't used as much to keep at my parents' place and a family vacation home.  Those are still going strong, too.  So I am hoping to get a new one with the 4 BLADES but I bumped the rating back up to 4 stars, only for the occasional tripping, but it really should be 5 considering how long it lasted and could have lasted. I needed a hair dryer to use about once or twice a month. I found this at a great price with mostly good reviews so I decided to purchase it. I am transitioning to natural kinky/curly hair and have BSL hair overall. I almost always air dry so i needed something to dry it if I was ever in a hurry. What I was looking for was: at least 1875 Watt dryer, Ionic, Compact, With multiple attachments (at least comb, diffuser and concentrator), Not too loud. This dryer fills all those requirements... except for one thing: no comb-attachment.Since this came with two attachments, I planned to purchase the third one from Revlon. For those unaware, Revlon hair products are licensed to Helen of Troy. I contacted HoT to inquire about which model of comb would fit this dryer, since most comb attachments are expensive and I did not want to waste my money. They were very fast to respond but no one could tell me if there was one available that would fit. After a week, I received an email saying that they do not make a comb attachment that would fit this particular model. They said that this particular dryer has a specific nozzle so no other attachments from them, or other brands would fit it. I was disappointed, since nowhere in the package or description page does it say this. Perhaps I was naive to think that a company would never think not to make other attachments that would fit their best selling economy model, other than the standard out of the box ones. Now I have to think if this dryer was worth it at all. Who wants to buy a separate dryer just for that one extra task?About the product:Pros:lightweight, unbulky overall.Heats up considerably. Warm is an adequate setting for me, but it might be too hot for someone with very fine straight hair.2 attachments, including the concentrator.good value for the price.fast shipping.Medium noiseCons:Cord is too short. Does not rotate easily either.Very cheap plastic, i'm afraid this could melt with heavy prolonged use.Can only be used with the specific attachments that come with it (2), which are not for sale separately (If you contact Helen of Troy they might send you some for free if yours break)Diffuser is a joke. Not long enough for long hair to dry effectively. The fingers are too short and it's not concave so the hot air just stays in the surface. People's heads are nor flat, Revlon!Conclusion:If you use your hair dryer very often, for long periods of time uninterrupted, this might die on you. If you use it very irregularly it's a good balance between the price and use. If you want to use other attachments other than the ones that come with it, you might be out of luck. If you are purchasing this solely for the diffuser, I would stay away from this. Would I purchase this again if it broke down? No, I wouldn't, but it will do for the time being.",4,4,0

frizz out of the hair really well, and rolls it very nicely, if you are trying to make a roll.  It is harder to use (brush through and roll) than my bigger brush which is not a wooden brush (bigger in diameter), but it really does a nice job.  Thank you! I've been using it for a year now. I like boars hair brushes and loved my last one but sadly it was time to replace.  The blow out I achieve with this one is good.  Bristles are long.  Not as stiff as i would have wanted but they do the job.  My main complaint is the handle.  It's awful small.  I have long hair and it can take about a half hour or so to give myself the blow out.  My hand starts cramping after about 10 minutes into it or so.  Also, since it's so smooth if your hands are even a little wet it becomes harder to hold. Good brush but the handle is to thin. I love the shine my hair achieves with this brush.  It is what my hair stylist recommended.  Works great with little static! Works well for my long gray hair. Smooths nicely. The handle seems a little short as is the head of the brush. Nice feel to the wood handle. Bristles are very thick. I have been searching for a round brush to replace my very old one. Almost bought a much more expensive one at Ulta, but after reading the reviews, decided to give this one a try. I have used it for almost a month and love it so much, I’m buying another in case anything happens to this one. While the handle is slim, it isn’t that uncomfortable. The handle is lightweight and the bristles have just the right amount of boar to synthetic to get smooth blowout. This little brush is light and easy but my hair gets tangle very easy This little brush does a nice job styling my super short hair. The big problem is that it gets stuck quite often, instead of smoothly moving through my hair. Perhaps a boar bristle brush would work better.",4,4,0

5 medium neutral brown. I used Wella Color Charm 5RG, 6RG, and 6R, mixed in the following formulation: 1 oz 6RG, 0.5 oz 5RG, and 0.5 oz 6R with 4 oz Wella 20 volume cream developer. What you see in the picture is the result and I couldn't be happier! I didn't lose definition in my 3A curls, and after an Olaplex No 3 and then a deep moisturizing conditioning treatment, my hair is SO soft and feels healthy! I am NOT a professional by any means. This is my first time mixing hair color or using anything at home that didn't come in a box. I just did a lot of research and came up with my own formulation. It's a keeper! Clairol discontinued 7RG Red Clay, so I was on a desperate mission to find something similar without needing color corrections 😬 Per another reviewer I used the full bottle of Light Copper and half Terra Cotta with 20v developer. My natural color (which I haven’t really seen in decades!) is a light/medium brown. I love it! Before picture is on the left. Great color and coverage.  Lasted a little longer than most trying to cover resistant gray.  I have bought it several times.  It's my go to when I can't get my redken at the supply store. Use this cool additive with t fourteen or t eighteen for perfect silver level ten hair. It works good and it covers the gray hair, but after 2-3 washes my gray is visible again Me encanta exelente tonalidad a un precio muy comodo The smell is horrid. However this is an ADDITIVE meaning you can ADD it to other toners to lift yellow toners while toning. I however used this with 20 vol cream developer AS A TONER. I mixed them as if it was a toner and left it on for roughly 30 minutes. Beautiful color, I adore this. Hope this helps someone else with the same concerns/questions. Photos are before and after no filter. Thankfully it’s lightened up a little after a week and a half of daily washing my hair.  I went from light blonde to the medium smokey ash blonde.  I would describe this color was more of a light ash brown right after I dyed my hair and has lightened up to a dark ash blonde.  On a positive note, my eyebrows now match my hair color.  I’m going to try the light ash blonde next to see if that’s closer to what I was hoping this color would be.",1,5,-4

The water smells like eggs it was making my hair super brittle and super unmanageable. It would cause frizzy dry hair and at the same time a greasy slimy texture. Dandruff and little like orange brown type flakes or chunks that would fall from my scalp and get all over my clothes and throughout my hair was super embarrassing.  Hard to imagine but all these symptoms at the same time make it hard for me to go out in public because of insecurities and embarrassment. I was always thinking people can see the slime goopy/ short broken fizzed out hair and notice how uncomfortable I was constantly fidgeting with my hair along with itchiness. I went all out and bought a 20 stage shower filter, a handheld showerhead with a filter inside the hand held part,  and another 150 stage shower filter on top of the Malibu c hard water wellness kit. I combined all three shower filters before I used the Malibu kit. So I don't know how the product works without the shower filters. I should have tired without the filters but I could not wait. With the shower filters it is a dramatic change from before using untreated well water with the best non paraben non sulfate shampoo and conditioner hair products.  This product  made my hair so much more manageable and  so soft it felt as if I was showering in real soft water or regular water treatment system that doesn't smell like eggs. Hair is weightless after first use and bouncy and easily untangled. Super recommend this product but I also encourage a shower filter system. :-) xoxo I had to move to rural Ohio to be closer to family and our house here has a well and hard water. No matter what I tried, my hair was rough textured, had an orange cast and was generally in awful condition. No color correction or moisturizing products did any good.Then I saw my old hairstylist who had cut my hair for years and he immediately recommended Malibu C for Hard Water. From the first time I used it, I could tell a difference in both the color and texture of my hair. After doing 1 of the supplement treatments and using the shampoo and conditioner twice a week for a month, my hair was soft and shiny again. It has a smooth texture and is soft and even colored with no more orange or brassy tones! Seriously, I cannot recommend Malibu C enough. I will definitely keep on using it!! I bought Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Vegan Hair Care Collection to help with my dry hair after a year and a half of hard water use. We moved into our house and didn’t know that the area had hard water. Slowly I started to notice that my very easy to manage hair got more dry and frizzy and just wasn’t doing what I wanted it to anymore. I went to the hair dresser and she told me the area I live is known for hard water and to give this product a shot. It took me awhile to actually bite the bullet and buy it, as I bought a filter and was hoping that would work, but I finally did. I have used the shampoo and conditioner twice now. While I can say that this is helping, it alone does not make my hair softer. I have had to pair the shampoo, conditioner, and treatment with other deep moisture and leave in treatments in order to restore the moisture back to my hair. From my experience so far I will likely keep this shampoo and conditioner in my routine to help manage the build up of minerals from our hard water. I moved into a house will well water a year ago.  We do have a water softener, but my hair had been feeling so dry, gross and extremely tangly.  My hair goes halfway down my back and I was ready to cut it off past my shoulders.  I would have to spend such a long time brushing through my hair after showers that my arms would go numb!  I started looking into Shampoo/Cond specifically for hard water and took a try with this based upon reviews.  AMAZING!  After the first wash and use of the packet, I have my hair back!  It's SO much easier to brush.  After drying it, it's so smooth and shiny.  I want to cry I'm so happy!  This product is a little pricey but I think it's worth it!!! This product has legit saved my hair. I have a filter on my shower head specifically for hard water that I change out every few months and although that helped mitigate the effects of the hard water on my hair it definitely was not doing enough. I had family visit and my sister said she felt like she had a weird film on her hair after just showering once even with the filter. I finally bought this shampoo/conditioner/treatment combo and I could tell the difference immediately. I have fine/thin hair that had become very frizzy/dry at the bottom, quick to look oily at the roots, breaking incredibly easily and so tangled it would take 10 minutes to comb out post shower. After 2 washes I could not believe how much better my hair looked and felt. I could not be happier with the results and absolutely recommend this to other people! I feel like I finally have my hair back again after 3 years of struggles & frustrations. I have a house no water softener city water but super hard. My hair is thin and unhealthy. I have over processed my hair. I haven’t necessarily treated my hair perfect but since I moved to my new house my hair became brittle unhealthy and always looked dirty. I wanted to chop it off. The first time I used this product I was impressed made my hair soft but not silky synthetic feeling. My hair stylist dyed my hair black with violet tones. my hair looked greasy first time I washed it. It felt limp and lifeless. If I added any products it was making it worse. I was in tears!!!!! It looked like my hair hadn’t been washed in month. I got back in shower and used the treatment followed by shampoo. No I don’t recommend if you want to preserve hair color but I didn’t want overly dark hair. It washed some of the color out and made my hair feel like hair again. I also think this product is good if you want to start washing hair less too cause it really cleans the hair. I Can tell the difference after one use. It smells so so good. I do feel like i need to use a lot of product though. It says to use it once I week and I usually do two times. Little pricey considering how fast I go through it but it has made a difference :)",5,2,3

The nice thing is that it gets rid of frizz while also enhancing the natural waves in my hair.  I first got this product at the salon, so it's nice to find it on Amazon.  The 3.4 ounces last a long time. Wonderful product for my thick frizzy hair. I have straight hair but it gives it that out of the salon shine and blow dry look hard to achieve at home.  It makes straight hair look like it's been flat ironed! My aunt was staying with me and forgot her hair product at home. She said she could never get the frizz out of her hair. She tried Enjoy Shine and she absolutely loved it!  It worked great on her hair. Same great leave in I've used for almost 20 yrs! If you're looking for shine this product does not really create shine, BUT it makes your hair super soft. I straighten my hair every day, so i have split ends but after straightening my hair ill put a small amount on my hair and it transforms it from dry and dead to smooth & soft ! Also it lasts a while so its a good investment and smells great too ! My hair dresser recommended this product because I have fuzzy hair and it's amazing! I blow dry my hair, put a little bit of this in and then curl it! The best! Highly recommend. I have fine hair and it doesn't make my hair look dirty or weigh it down. Have been using this for years. My favorite. Only need a small amount to manage my short hair for the whole day. I use this product to tame frizz and adding shine to my hair. I have tried many products and I have finally found my formula.",5,4,1

The handle is on the small and thin for a person with bigger hands. Was looking to replace my old isinis and this is the closest I have found yet but the bristles are harder and the bed has less flex.  Otherwise a good value. After reading all of the positive reviews on this brush, I decided to give it a try.  I purchased 7 other brushes from reading the reviews on those, and I wasn't really impressed when I received the brush.  So I really wasn't expecting much from this one either, but I was hoping it would be better.  It arrived today and as soon as I took it out of the box, I ran it through my hair and it felt so good, I wanted to just keep brushing.  I needed a good smoothing brush for wrapping my hair.  I needed the bristles to be stiff enough to reach my scalp to smooth out my curls at the scalp, not just on top, but not so hard that it felt like I was going to draw blood if I kept brushing. This brush is perfect. The bristles aren't so close together that it pulls my hair out, like so many of the other brushes did. I don't see much of my hair in this brush at all.  My husband and I have been fighting over a brush that I purchased 20 years ago. The bristle are falling out, but we were still reluctant to let it go, because it was the last good brush we had and I haven't been able to find them anymore. After using this brush, he agrees we can finally let the old brush go.  He sent me back here to buy 2 more of these for him and another 1 for myself, just in case they discontinue this one without notice like the other one was. I owned one of these brushes decades ago.  It lasted for years. The next brush like it the bristles sunk down into the foam but I still thought it was better than any other brush. The bristles were soft but not too soft.  This new brush has very hard, and stiff bristles that started to sink down into the foam within the first week.What use to be the perfect brush is now just another brush.  Why couldn't the manufacturer have left perfect alone? The bristles are very stiff. Would like for them to have a little more give. I've used a brush like this my entire life. I've tried many other types of brushes but there's just something about how these feel when you rake them across your scalp. It massages your scalp and is gentle on your hair. If you have long hair this is a must. Just don't use with heat tools or you'll met the nylon bristles! I like it, easy to handle.",2,4,-2

One day I walked into a new local salon (because my tried-and-true was super busy) and asked for a regular blow-out along with the best deep conditioning treatment they had.  Although, I was not told the name of the product or manufacturer I did catch a glimpse of the container and remembered the very distinct (very earthy and natural) smell and color of what was being applied.  During my blow-out I noticed that the other customers were staring at my hair and one other person actually asked, ""Can you please tell me what you used in her hair?"" after it was done.My hair felt incredibly soft, had tons of slip and was not weighed down...most incredibly the cuticle of each strand of hair looked very smooth, was not dull in color and this looked credibly brilliant and super shiny (almost as if it was so health it could reflect light of the strands).  As soon as I got home, I Googled this product and purchased it online after seeing other had similar experiences.  Please listen to all the other reviewers, this product has earned a permanent place in my hair care routine as I have not been able to find any other products that compare to its conditioning competency.  If your hair is like mine and grows resistant to products after constant use you will have to switch off between this and some other treatment like a protein treatment.  I do not use this each time I wash my hair and my other product of choice is Rapunzel's Protein Deep Conditioner.I began taking this conditioning treatment to my main Dominican stylist, each time I bring it she tells me how good this product is and its way better than anything she carries in her salon.  This product rightfully earned 5 stars the only reason I did not rate it that high is because over the years my hair seems to have grown a bit resistant to the benefits of this treatment (hence, the reason why I play between two main deep conditioners) and I have not seen the same dramatic results from my earlier use.  Also, you get much better results with this product when its used by a professional stylist.  In my opinion I buy products like this because I want salon quality results every time at home. This product is interesting. It’s different compared to curly curl mixes. This feels like a deep chemical conditioner whearas other products feel natural conditioning. It works great but can over dry hair if left in too long. It seems to loosen my curls not in a stringy way but a smoothing way. It’s worth a try and any one i know who uses it really loves it. I love this product it’s also $20 cheaper on her than at the salon. I use a little on my ends and walk out he door. Rinse out at the end of the day. It’s perfect and I love the smell. Excelente reparacion Estaba buscando un producto que me ayudara a darle hidratación, brillo y volumen a mi cabello , pero a la vez que me permitiera tener una textura natural cuando esté seco mi cabello para evitar tener que estarlo secando y exponiendo tanto al calor. Este producto me ayudo a alcanzar ese look natural, sin necesidad de secado El cabello queda suave un olor fuerte pero después del lavado desaparece el olor Me agrado la entrega de amazon siempre muy eficiente ,rapida. Lo que no me agrado y la compania salerm deveria poner atencion es sellar bien los botes por dentro cuando yo habri mi pedido estaba sellado por fuera pero no por dentro y de se derramo una porcion de mi pedido lo cual deberian de reconocerme por lo que page est es inaceptable. gracias Angelica Bulliner.",4,5,-1

I love how this makes my hair feel and smell but it almost makes it too soft. Make sure you start with a tiny amount, this bottle will probably last me for 20 years Title says it all. Used about a quarter sized amount. Ran thru damp hair. Left it in overnight. My hair went from thick straw to manageable softer hair (1 application). After 4 applications my hair feels smooth and soft. It works. My only negative is the smell is weird. For me it smells like an artificial chemical interpretation of a fruity aloe vera (like cheap artificial candy). A little goes a long way so the smell is tolerable since I use so little everytime and the results are seen in 1 application. Ymmv Good product that I have used for year.  Pricey but you pay for what you get. I use this as a daily leave in conditioner.  It controls frizz and helps keep my curls.",3,5,-2

Upon removing it from shipping, I noticed that the pump assembly had some dried blue goo around it. When I twisted the pump in order to activate it, a large amount of product released from inside and coated the shaft of the pump, leaking down onto the bottle. Some product design tweaking needs to happen here to prevent leaks - perhaps a plastic sleeve that can be removed but will protect the head during shipping.Other than packaging, a solid 4 star product which reduces and helps prevent dandruff - and that's why I bought it! Works every time, and smells clean and fresh and masculine. Head and shoulders doesn't do too much for my dandruff, but this is a good size if it's what you use. Scent is nice We love Head & Shoulders in our house, so I decided to try ordering it through Subscribe & Save.  I had concerns about it leaking but thought I'd try it out.  When it arrived, one of the bottles had leaked, BUT it's packaged in a sealed plastic bag, there was no mess anywhere else but in the bag.  When I contacted Amazon's customer service about it, they shipped a replacement RIGHT AWAY.  Any worries I had about buying shampoo from Amazon have gone.  I will keep it on my Subscribe & Save list, and I recommend this product (and Amazon's customer service) to anyone! This product does what it says.  I've never had dandruff problems until the last few months when I realized that I've gotten old enough to not need to shower every day.  Don't get me wrong, I like showers and hygiene, but it occurred to me that I'm not as greasy as I used to be, and if I want to maintain healthy, youthful skin, I shouldn't dry it out showering every day like I was a teenager.  So I cut back, which seemed to work great for my youthful skin purposes.  BUT dandruff started to develop.  Yeah, I noticed when I had flakes on my dark jacket.No worries though, this product fixed it, and I still only shower a couple of times a week. My husband only uses this shampoo. It only makes sense to get it in the largest size. He does not seem to struggle with dandruff on a daily basis, but this keeps the dandruff at bay. It keeps his hair smelling fresh, feeling clean, and looking oil-free. He has been using this for years. He has used other products, but they do not seem to work as well as this. I am fairly certain that if the Zombie Apocalypse were to occur, he would not be going without this. Heck, he might even recommend it to the Zombies. This is a great value and a great product.  My only complaint is that the pump is a bit awkward when handled with wet hands, which I would hope the manufacturer would have taken into consideration due to the nature of their product.  Other large volume shampoos have a much better design in their pump heads so not so much force is needed to get the product (and risk it slipping backwards and falling on one's foot) I love head and shoulders neither I nor my husband have a problem with dandruff but after researching all different kinds of shampoo I kept coming across the head and shoulders. So I gave it a try, my hair almost instantly became shiny and soft. I have color treated hair and I was so amazed by how soft and healthy my hair looked it does not have a strong odor like many other dandruff shampoos so people wont even tell you are using. It doesn't dry out my scalp like many shampoos do. I would recommend this product even if you don't have dandruff. I have never had dandruff but started using Head and Shoulders after using some on a vacation at a friend's place. I like the smell of the stuff and it's not harsh on the hair. Other shampoos make my hair too ""fluffy"" even with conditioner (which I use with H&S). just a good ""staple"" shampoo. I'm not fancy in any grooming regards so it's just shampoo",1,3,-2

I could never go out after letting my hair air dry before I started using this product I bought this thinking it was the skinny serum which I have been using since high school (about 2008/2009). Not one to be wasteful, I planned on giving it a try and if I didn't like it, I'd be sure to but the serum next time. And omg I like it so much more. The serum is great for frizz and worked well for when I straightened my hair. But this balm works great for just blow drying my hair. I don't use a round brush when I dry my hair if I'm not going anywhere and when I use this product and just dry my hair any which way, including bending forward and drying it upside down (just so I don't have wet hair), it still looks great. I don't know what it does. Maybe adds a little extra weight to my hair or something but it looks soft, frizz free, and as if I carefully styled it with my round brush. I prefer to scent of the serum to this (but then again, that could just be the nostalgia of using the serum for my entire adult life lol) but this smells fine as well. So, I love the Super Skinny Serum which is a different product, it works GREAT for frizz. This one smells amazing and helps my thick heavy hair dry quicker!! It also takes less for me to straighten with my unconsistent wave pattern. I don't feel like it does as much for the frizz though. It is super lightweight though I ordered the wrong item by mistake. But, OH THE SMELL! if I could figure out how to contact the seller I would. It had a fish odor to it like I had just caught a dead fish and stuck it in the bottle. Awful! I have used this product for years and I love it! It is light and doesn't leave your hair greasy looking. I’m so glad they still have this I used to use it all the time like 10 years ago and then moved and could never find it so thank god I can order it on here! This stuff is the best. I have really frizzy hair and this helps so much! Great product",2,5,-3

This made Toppik so much better because it can easily direct where I want the fibers to go. With out it, I wouldn't even bother trying to use Toppik on it's own since it's basically like a salt shaker. I would've given it 5 stars but I do consider it a little overpriced for what it is but still a must buy for me. Lid is great for your Toppik distribution.. Easy to use The applicator is too big for the product I purchased, so I haven't had the chance to use it. So I can't honestly say whether it's good or not. The pump gets stuck often, but it works...  good application if you use it correctly. I really like this applicator now that I have a handle on how to use it.  At first I found myself feeling it was hopelessly clogged and had to be routinely replaced. However, I've learned a few things over time and through trial & error. 1) Use the smallest size Toppik container. Even though this sprayer will work with either 12 g or 27.5 g container size, it doesn't work well when the product is too low in the container - that is, when the top of the product is more than an inch from the top of the container. For this reason, I suggest strongly that you use it on the 12 g container.  I buy the 27.5 g container, and I use that to refill the 12 g container. This applicator works like a suction and it won't be able to suck up the fibers if they are too far from the top. Keep it more than half full and shake while using to keep things flowing. 2) Can the applicator clog? Sure it can - but in my experience this isn't what's keeping it from working. However, if you're unsure then remove the applicator from the product container and immerse it in water and see if you are able to pump water through it. If so, then the water either resolved the clog or there was never a clog and you're probably experiencing a problem with the product being too low in the container. After you wet it, pump out all the water and put the applicator aside to allow it to dry before you attempt to use it. The spray applicator shouldn't be used while it's wet because then it will definitely clog. 3) Sometimes you just have to use the original product as a shaker. The spray applicator isn't the best to use for every situation, so your overall results will be best if you keep a shaker cap on hand so you have this option open. It's a little pricey. Should have been cheaper! I could not get the applicator on the bottle to see how it works.  And i forgot to return this item.  It's sitting on my dresser collecting dust.",3,4,-1

Too bad it is extremely small. If you want to save money, I would look into Hunter shampoo if you want something without an aroma. I am now using SCENT AWAY, a shampoo and body wash for hunters. They do not want their smell giving them way. The request for my opinion of the pureness or thickness, I do not understand. What the heck are those qualities? I use many of the DHS products and like them all.  I use the Zinc shampoo about once a week or alternate with the SAL shampoo.  Both work really well.  I also use the DHS hair rinse if my hair feels too dry from any shampoo. It has eliminated the need for a conditioner and is light but adds enough body to eliminated fly away hair.Now I found DHS clear shampoo and I've been using it almost everyday.  Love it. Feels good , my hair isn't weighted down or irritated. .  DHS is a great company for treating issues with hair and scalp problems.  Highly recommend. I don't like that there is no smell on this product but I already knew that before I purchased it.  However; i do love the feel in my hair, soft , light and super clean.  Will highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a lightweight shampoo. recommended by my dermatologist as I can't use scented products and a lot of shampoos rinses irritate scalp - this does not This has few ingredients, almost no/no objectionable smell and generally rinses clean. Very sensitive scalp but I use this no more than once a month to clean oils from scalp and hair left behind by daily use of necessary gentler shampoo. It lathers well, strips oils out, and hair feels lighter after, but is not unduly drying. Depending upon your sensitivity this might work, despite SLS and CAPB as ingredients. My dermatologist told me to buy this because of allergies.  It actually cleans my hair really well.  No perfume so it’s great for sensitive skin.  Leaves hair nice and shiny. Great packaging- the shampoo did not leak at all. My dermatologist recommended this product and wanted to charge about double what I paid here. This stuff works great- no residue/film left on my face like normal shampoos in stores do and my face has cleared tremendously after only one use! It's clear in color and scent, so if I want my hair to have a nice scent I just use a little bit of conditioner (any kind I have on hand)- only on the ends of my hair. Not quite as great as I expected for the price.It’s not horrible, but I really couldn't tell any difference between this and the generic Walmart free and clear shampoo.",1,2,-1

One star off for forgetting something simple but important since I travel alot!! I have used this this product for many years. It is a major seller for Nexxus!!  It used to cost $5 a bottle....then the price increased to $30 bottle.  I found some at Amazon for $40 a bottle. But I'm looking to find something to replace it.  I'm tired of searching......  On to something else!! It was missing the cap. I was too lazy to return this, but bottle  arrived without cap.  This is a reflection of the seller not the product!I decided to purchase this after my hairdresser used it on me.  I would have bought it from my hairdresser, but I wanted to see how it affected my hair the next day and if it washed out well.  All was good.I bought this for TRAVEL so no cap a big deal.I like the product pretty good for when my long hair gets dry and tangled.  I spray it on my towel dried ends when I get out of the shower, wait 5 minutes or so, then get to combing and re- apply as needed.  Helps well on brushing dry tangly hair too.It works well. It doesn’t leave my hair dry and lifeless like so many other dimethicone type products. Nor sticky like other products.For me, it’s overpriced for what it is (but I don’t know of a cheaper replacement)  and I have other products I prefer usually, but it’s kind of my go to quick fix and that’s why I wanted it for travel.I’m sure it’s great as a spray on dry straight hair for quick de tangling or frizzy fixes without weighing things down or drying them out.My hairs a bit curly/frizzy so I lean towards more moisturizing products, but this product is NOT totally drying (which is wonderful compared to so many other products out there) - I just feel like it’s a product for folks that want to wear their hair straight.But it arrived used with no lid.  So I spent $20 on something for travel I cant travel with...Sign of the times. Sign of Amazon times. My hair LOVES this product.Honestly --- I'd love to recommend it to everyone and anyone who has a bit of dry / frizz / color treated / heat styled / could use a bit of moisture in their hair diet, just likes to spray stuff on their hair after a day or so to refresh it (dry shampoo makes my hair feel icky unless it's totally greasy) and make it smell yummy  ---- BUT!!! --- not everyone's hair is the same. SO!I would generally recommend this product for people who have baby fine (I can grab all of my hair - regardless of the fact it's past middle of my back - twisted up twice between thumb and forefinger) to medium fine, naturally kind of wavy or curly which usually equals frizzy or humidity driven insanity hair. ---- who are looking for a bit of something extra to help make your hair a touch more soft, a touch shinier, a good margin healthier if you keep using it, maybe looking to help counteract regular color-treating ... This is about all I can vouch for, and that I've used this product in the hair of.I also use this product in my hair when it's dry, though it says to use only when your hair is wet. If I shower at night and forget to put product in it that night, the next morning I'll use Straight Iron Heat Protection (on dry hair, which usually the instructions on most brands say on wet or dry hair -- but as you know it doesn't totally drench your hair of course) and then I'll spray this on my hair and comb/brush through, then flat iron. I usually don't even need a finishing a finishing spray unless there's a tempest outside or where I live next to the ocean sometimes the humidity creeps to 98% and so the most I use is Hairspray with Flexible Hold, Brushable, 2. Oh and this stuff smells DIVINE. This is one of my favorite Nexxus products, and I think a lot of customers feel the same.  My only complaint is that it is very often not available!  Please make more!!Addedon Nov. 10, 2022  Well, I've given up on this product and have found one by Pantene that I like even more, and it costs less that $10! In the evening I shower and wash my hair then spray 2-3 sprays in my hair after blow drying. Then I go to sleep with a hair cap on. To detangle in  morning  I spray my hair with a water mist then 2-3 more sprays of this conditioner and comb through. Hair is soft and detangled. My hair doesn’t feel as dry as it used to. I pair this with a serum to hydrate the dry ends of my hair. My hair is color treated blonde and is fragile so cheap products will not work on me. This product is pricey but it does the job. I really like the scent of this spray mist. It did leave my hair feeling soft too. I'm not certain if it left my hair conditioned or not right now. I'll have to keep using it to decide if it conditions my hair.",4,1,3

It makes my hair soft and isn’t too heavy for my finer hair. Love the mild fragrance which dissipates quickly. I’m a natural brunette that has bleached her hair for a good amount of years and it’s the only thing that’s kept my hair healthy, smooth, and maintainable. I do wish the scent was different but it’s not a deal breaker. This product is a miracle worker if you color your hair a lot! Kinda expensive but worth it! Used this whole bottle before writing a review so that I could give an honest opinion. I saw this product recommended on social media and figured I would give it a try. It is a nice, thick conditioner. However, it does not make my hair any softer or silkier than my favorite drug store conditioner that is much, much cheaper. It also has a strange smell, and does not make my hair smell good at all (which my drug store conditioner does). I found myself reaching for my cheaper conditioner every time. Overall, it’s a fine product. Definitely NOT worth the price tag. Will not repurchase or recommend this product to friends. Use this product for years and love it. I have used Enjoy conditioner that I use to purchase from our local salon. Unfortunately for some reason or another they stopped carrying this line.I was happy but hesitant to order it here on Amazon because some reviewers say it's fake.I know from a few past purchases I have received without a doubt fake products which really gets me angry because we all pay good money for these products.I was happy when I opened this to find it to be the real deal.I remember exactly how this product works, smells and what it looks like.I would like to think we can trust third party sellers after all we do help keep them in bussiness.I also would like to think that they do know that those of us whom are not new to this line are not being fooled.That said this delivered the exact same results as when I purchased it last from my salon.This leaves my hair so smooth and because I color my hair it quickly repairs the dry ends and leaves my hair free of frizz.My bottle does not look like this at all.Mine is purple and says Enjoy but my understanding is they changed the bottles so some people still may get the older looking version but still the same great formula.I am gonna order again now that my Husband has decided to tap into this but I'm hoping to order from the same seller.If not hopefully I will get another authentic one.I am not a fan of the Enjoy Shampoo but I do love the conditioner ,it really delivers salon looking results. I've used this for years it's the best! My hair is long, and thick, and dry. A little bit of enjoy goes a long way. The more you use it, the better your hair gets. Helpful hint, use small spritzes of leave in conditioner in between washes ! This stuff really works. I have really long, really thick, coarse, wavy hair that snarls a lot when I shampoo it. I love this conditioner because it makes combing out my wet hair so much easier when I get out of the shower. The smell is a little overpowering at first but it fades as my hair dries so I can live with it.",5,4,1

Poor shipping.  Bought the large pump size fir valu and convience.  Can't use the pump. It arrived broken. I was looking for a product to save my hair from the effects of softened water.  My husband installed a water filtration system complete with softened water in our new house.  I didn't have the heart to tell him that this was killing my hair color treatments. I was using expensive Redken products that combined with the soft water, caused a gross build up in my hair and my hair color was turning brassy brunette between colorings from the minerals deposited in my hair after every rinse.  My hair is thick and extremely curly and I had a terrible time smoothing my hair and controlling any style.  I tried the Malibu Well Water Action hair system because it advertised that it would work with soft water.  I am happy to report that my hair is now soft and clean.  The shampoo really does clarify the hair and remove product build up. My  hair feels so light and healthy, its amazing. It feels young again. The shampoo lathers up really nice and rinses clean. I was a little worried at first because after shampooing my hair, it felt very dry and almost stripped, but that is immediately resolved by using the Malibu Well Water Action Conditioner.  I used this product for 2 months and decided to give my Redken products another try because I hated the idea of throwing it out.  After using the Redken Shampoo for colored hair again just once, I was so grossed out by the immediate build up left in my hair, that I washed my hair again the same day with the Malibu Well Water Action shampoo and conditioner. Immediate relief!  I will never go back to Redken again.  My color treatments last longer and do not fade as fast.  The price of the Malibu Well Water action system is no more expensive than Redken is.  I also appreciated being able to buy a try it kit, (Shampoo, Conditioner,  Hard Water Weekly Demineralizer packet).  I love the system!  Try it, you will not be disappointed! This is probably my 3rd time purchasing this product, but since I purchased it in a 2 pack the review does not stick.  We moved and changed water companies and I guess we have hard water.  No lather and normal shampoos just do not leave my hair feeling good.  I researched this shampoo out before buying it and there were no regrets in my purchase.  As mentioned, this is my 3rd big bottle. The last one lasted me from May to December.  This is mostly my husband using this shampoo these days and he does not have a lot of hair.  :-p  I tend to rotate through shampoos that I get from Sephora and sometimes I am able to get shampoos to review so that is why this shampoo lasted us a long time.  Lathers well, rinses well.  Keeps your hair looking clean and ready for your favorite conditioner.  I think I have bought the companion conditioner before, I just do not think I repurchased it. I too recently purchashed a home in a rural area with a well. My hair was turning orange, breaking off (looked like a shedding mutt),I hated going out in public and hearing jokes about my Bozo hair. I tried coloring my hair and it would not take the color. I was using an extreme amount of hair spray trying to style my hair. My hair laid flat and was glowing in the dark orange.It was to the point of being ridiculous. I started reading online things to try to get the orange to fade. Nothing worked. I finally came across Malibu products. I thought why not, I've tried everything else. It""s like a miracle! My hair is now a normal color. It bounces and shines.I can style it and it last all day at work without a bunch of hairspray. It's not breaking off. I threw out all of my other shampoos and conditioners. I will never again use another product. LOVE IT! I swear by it. It's a miracle. The bottle says it can be used as a body wash also. I thought I'ld give it a try. Another miracle. No more itchy skin. I also threw out all of my other body washes. A MIRACLE. Thank you Malibu. This Shampoo is fantastic and does what it says.  The only reason for 4 stars is the pump.  The shampoo is very thick and the pump takes FOREVER to ""refill"" and pump another amount out.  I have very long hair and I use about 5-6 pumps to wash.  I've started just unscrewing the pump and poring it out.  If they would give an option of a different lid I'd appreciate it.  I'm still going to continue to buy this because the product really does work well!! Our well water is full of minerals and my hair looks & feels dull if I don't use a shampoo that clarifies it.  I've used Ion and it was ok, but I didn't like how watery it was.  Also used Pureology's Purify and thought it was pretty effective, but the bottle was small and kind of spendy, so I started window shopping and found Malibu C a while back.Love the smell and feel of this shampoo, and it keeps my color treated hair looking vibrant.  But I didn't realize how good I had it until I used what was left of my Pureology shampoo yesterday.  Yikes.  It gave my hair that feeling you get from a harsh shampoo that strips it.  Couldn't get my fingers all the way through it during the rinse.  So now I'll stick with Malibu unless something more magical comes along.  Works well, feels good, price is right. This shampoo is very clarifying. It will strip your hair of all hard water build-up and leave your hair feeling squeaky clean and shiny. Would definitely recommend this to people who don't wash their hair too often as a clarifier; preferably for use once-a-week. It is WAY too intense for everyday use. No sulfates, vegan and cruelty-free is also a wonderful bonus. For the price, you get a lot of product. I'm giving this product only four stars, however, because the packaging made the shampoo leak all over the box and I probably lost five ounces of product. I assume that's because of the pump nozzle. Overall, though, this is a great product.",2,1,1

I personally did not like this brush though, because there are so many bristles so close together, it’s hard to get a good scrub and move around your scalp without pulling you hair. I do have type 2B hair, which makes me think it would work better for people with fine hair or people with really short hairOverall, didn’t work for me, but was a good quality product for the price Wonderful for scalp message and really a lot of foam from shampoo. Feels great on scalp. This rough exfoliator is great for super built-in dirt. I use silicone on my scalp, and this is hard plastic. Great though, I use it a couple of times a week. GET THIS!!!I’ve had this for five years and it’s held up all this time! I lost it and I cried.If I don’t have it, it’s honestly like I didn’t even wash my hair. My hair is super thick and course. I have pretty bad dandruff too that I try and manage with T-Sal and whatever pyrithione zinc conditioner - usually a product from Head and Shoulders or Dove. Using this to actually get product through my hair and onto my scalp is essential to feeling and looking good.Also, I chew and trim my nails OBSESSIVELY! Whenever my fingers get sensitive trying to do what this does in the shower, I do not get great results.To anyone with thick and course hair or with issues with their scalp, get this and you will never go back to anything else. You wouldn’t know it from looking at it, but my hair gets so tangled underneath. I have to comb it out before washing it, while washing it/when conditioner is in it, and after towel drying it. This handy device has saved me loads of time! It seems to comb through much more easily than a comb or brush. And doesn’t appear to hurt the hair. I bought extras and have them in bathroom, purse, travel bag, carry on airplane bag, and extras in the linen closet. -I just don’t want to find myself without it!! (It also works great for scrubbing the shampoo in and out. This has helped cut down on some greasiness; before using this I guess not all the shampoo was being rinsed out /a little was getting trapped underneath in places.) These are fantastic for washing one’s hair. They  get to the scalp and work in the shampoo or conditioner. They also enliven the scalp. The only thing I have against this one is that it’s just a molded piece of plastic and it’s not as cheap as it should be. About two years ago, you could buy a package of ten of these for about four bucks.",2,4,-2

Style Butterfly Clamps, Assorted Colors, 1 Dozen","Great clips, although the ones I received were in a much different color scheme than the ones pictured. Mine are translucent pastel colors (some light gray and white). Didn't really care either way, however. These are so much better than traditional jawclips in terms of getting a grab on your hair. These clips are intended for hair-styling purposes more so than using IN a hairstyle if you get what I mean. I probably wouldn't wear one out-and-about but I do use them for sectioning off my hair when I'm blow-drying, curling, or straightening it. Also nice for using to get hair away from face while applying makeup or washing your face. The ""grip"" power these have on your hair is like nothing I've ever had in a hair clip. The word ""clamp"" in the product title is accurate. These do not budge  or shift, even in straight hair. They really lock your hair in, I think the triangular nature of the teeth on the clips has something to do with that. Very versatile clips that I will most definitely get a lot of use out of, and priced well for the amount you get. I have been looking for these for years.  I still have a few of the ones I bought years and years ago, but haven't been able to find them.  I just figured they were a relic of the past, and then I stumbled across them on Amazon.  I keep one in the shower, so after conditioning I can put my hair up while the conditioner does its thing.  I keep a few with my other hair products, in case I want to clip it in place till the gel or whatever product of the moment kicks in.  I keep a couple around for working out, to get my hair out of the way.  I keep a couple by my bedside, in case it's a warm night and I want it up.  These are so incredibly handy.  I love them, they work great.  The only way I've had them break is if someone steps on them!  They won't just crack or snap or anything.  I bought two packs of them, so that should last me a lifetime! These work great for getting your hair out of the way, for whatever reason you have to want it out of the way.In my case, I have sensitive skin that can get itchy if my hair touches my neck or back, so I use these at home to keep my hair off those areas, especially in the summer when I'm wearing skimpier tops. It's also great for keeping my hair out of the way when I have to do cooking or housework. It's a lot faster to glob my hair on my head and clamp it down with a couple of these than it is to monkey with a pony tail holder or barrettes or whatever.Bonus: The colors in this set (blue, light blue, purple) are some of my favorites, so they're not only useful, but also cute to look at. I was concerned that these would have sharp teeth that could potentially damage my hair. But once they arrived, I saw that the teeth were slightly rounded at the top and smooth to the touch.I was also concerned that because of the cheap price, the metal spring might rust. But after owning and using these for several months, I've seen no sign of that.I like that they grip my hair firmly, but not too tightly.The only thing I don't like is something a few other reviewers mentioned. The top part of the clamps that you squeeze together has sharp, pointy edges. So, one just needs to be careful when using them (or file the edges down with a nail file). I liked this product a lot. It held my hair in place. These clips were able to hold my hair in place while I was trying to either twist, braid or wash one side of my hair and the other side would be clipped to the side so I can focus on the style I was trying to achieve. I bought these in 2014 and they are still holding up and still strong. I would recommend that if your hair is waist length and very thick, it may not hold as much hair in one clip, you would have to have multiple smaller sections. You can't buy these in the stores anymore.  The clips they sell are too big for my hair so they fall out.  These hold my hair up when I need that. I was happy to find these on Amazon. The clips are nice and no doubt will be totally useful because who doesn't use clips.  The colors listed are lighter than they really are, but still pretty.  The lighter purple ones are darker like the top ones and the blue ones are more navy.  Other than the slight difference in color, I'm fine with them.  I have had these clips in the past and they have held up well, just wanted to have more on hand.  I had a shortage doing my hair and went a little crazy getting the dozen pack, but I'm sure I will use them.  I use these kind of clips everyday. So I have a lot of hair to the point that it looks thick, nope it's just my density is alive. And it came right before wash day and I was tired of using hair ties to section my hair before, during and after washing. And I must say these butterfly clips are amazing on my hair. It doesn't tug if used correctly. The clips are a little slippy with product on my hand however not that much. And with my natural hair I don't feel as if it's breaking it off. And the hold of the clip is amazing too.",5,4,1

Leaves Hair pH Balanced, Ideal for Over-Processed, Environmentally Stressed Hair, Sulfate Free, Paraben Free, Color Safe (Pack of 3)","I have fine hair and many conditioners are just too heavy for it. This 50-50 conditioner moisturizers and detangles my hair without weighing it down. From very long hair to very short hair (I had 17 inches cut off) I've been using Giovanni for 5 years. I used to spend way too much money on crappy name-brand products that did nothing except made my hair smell good.The first thing that impressed me about Giovanni (when I had hair to my butt) was that I only needed a tiny amount to condition my hair. I was going through a bottle of $15 conditioners in a week and I went through this conditioner in 3 weeks. It's like putting the most wonderful butter in your hair that washes out. The second (and most important) quality was that my hair was so soft and shiny! Whaaat! I've been spending too much on crap when this stuff has been around! I love Giovanni! And to top it off, they don't test on animals which is my number one rule when shopping. Try it out. If it doesn't work well you only lost a few bucks. But if it does then you'll be a lifer like me!And by the way, with hair to my shoulders now and 3 other people using the conditioner, we go through a bottle in 6 weeks! I've had dreads for over 10 years.  I just cut them off 2wks ago read a review on this item best choice i ever made. My hair was very slick and soft while using this conditioner. I ordered a second batch. I now will have 6 all together. I only used this product once today but I have to say I noticed immediate changes. Well balanced I have very long hair and every conditioner I use either makes my hair feel super greesy or super dry and staticky I think I will order the shampoo and see if I like them together I love this product for my 4a4b hair. I give this product an overall 3 stars because when I made the order it’s says set of 3 but I only received 1. Called Amazon they tried to send me the right order amount, but I received one again. I didn't call them back. Next time I probably will buy in store. This is my favorite conditioner. We just moved and can no longer find it in stores so buying it here. A bit pricier than it was in stores, hence the star off, but I still love the product. I've been on the hunt for a while now for a good conditioner and I've finally found it. This melted all the tangles out of it hair like butter. The consistency felt almost like whipped cream. I have type 4a/4b, low proposity btw I comb through this conditioner through my ends in the shower with a wide tooth comb. It detangles and moisturizes pretty well. I would repurchase again but I want to try Andalou Naturals next to see if it would be a little more moisturizing.",1,2,-1

Only negative from vendor I did not receive the pump twist on cap for the shampoo I like the way this product works on my hair-my hair is very processed (bleached) and this product helps my hair recover from the processing I dye my hair black every 6-8 weeks and as someone who has an oily scalp, this shampoo cleans my hair while maintaining the dye in my hair. It is a little bit on the drying side, but, if you oil your scalp once a week, you should be good to go. I love this Nexxus Color Assure Rebalancing Shampoo.  I did some research and found that Glamour magazine, In style magazine, and Allure magazine all recommend this product for color treated hair and color life longevity and vibrancy. I am new to coloring my hair as I now have gray hair that forced my hand.  It sucks since I have never been a ""go to the hair saloon girl"" and now I have to go once a month to cover the gray new hair growth.  I have always had natural red highlight tinged to my hair from my mixed Irish and French Canadian lineage so I was hesitant to color my hair and lose those natural highlights that make my hair me.  I have a great hairdresser who was able to match my hair color perfectly including the red highlights.  I was amazed and happy but found the color vibrancy did not last all that long and I just knew that it was my shampoo combined with how often I washed my hair.  So I started by only washing my hair every other day which helped preserved color life but not color vibrancy.  Also I am lucky that my hair was not greasy after not washing it for days, I know others who cannot go even one day without washing there hair.  Still, I needed to tackle color vibrancy and hair softness - what to do?  Google to the rescue.  I found via research that Nexxus Color Assure Rebalancing Shampoo was highly recommended  by both beauty magazines and hair saloons alike.  So I gave it a green light and was not disappointed.  Amazon.com to the rescue (Amazon.com is cheaper priced than even walmart for this product by almost $3 a bottle and with Amazon Prime it is delivered right to your door.  Win, Win).  Happy to report that my hair has most of it's natural looking color and shine back when after the coloring it was lackluster at best.  Due to the natural shine and oils in my hair I am on the fence to if I need hair conditioner or not, so I always try the hair shampoo by itself first to see if I need the hair conditioner or not.  This may change as my hair becomes acclimated to the hair shampoo but for now the hair shampoo alone leaves my hair tangle free and hair breakage minimal.  My hair is also very soft when the hair coloring had left it course and brittle before the Nexxus Color Assure Rebalancing Shampoo.  Highly recommend and very optimistic that it will last but time will tell if my hair becomes acclimated to the shampoo and the benefits of the shampoo decrease or not.  Time will tell but Nexxus Color Assure Rebalancing Shampoo is the best shampoo I have tried to date for color longevity (...less hair color dye comes off in shower), color vibrancy and shine, and hair texture softness.SIDENOTE:  The Nexxus Color Assure Rebalancing Shampoo scent is a pleasant light orchard smell and not overpowering like I have found in other high end shampoos' where you sacrifice smell for what benefits the shampoo can afford you.  Not the case with Nexxus Color Assure Rebalancing Shampoo which does not sacrifice scent whatsoever for greater good/benefits.  What a relief to not smell all chemically funky but I thought it was a necessary evil... but boy am I happy I was wrong...another perk of Nexxus Color Assure Rebalancing Shampoo is that you smell pleasant and not chemically whatsoever. This shampoo has a good lather, smells clean and fresh, and leaves my color treated hair soft and clean. I've been coloring my hair for many years, and the Nexxus Color Assure Sulfate-Free Shampoo For Color-Treated Hair with ProteinFusion makes my hair look hydrated. It doesn't strip my color and prevents brassiness. However, I've been trying to get used to sulfate free shampoos, but my hair never feels clean afterwards, and I find myself shampooing more often. All sulfate free shampoos have that effect on my hair, and I have had to use a clarifying shampoo every 2 weeks or so to prevent oily build up on my scalp. I live in a hot humid climate, so that may also be a factor. I will say this is the best and most effective shampoo for preserving color, and I have tried many. I LOVE this shampoo because it’s clear, doesn’t leave residue like other products, and best part is it is Sulfate Free. I’ve also experimented with many products to keep my violet/purple hair color from fading so quickly but this is my go to shampoo. I put 1/3 of the hair dye my hairstylist uses inside the bottle, shake it before every use, and BOOM you have your own color depositing shampoo that works great. First picture was taken the day I got my hair done from the salon and last picture is after the first wash. As you can see the color still looks great and it doesn’t fade horribly like from other products I’ve used. I recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner and using 1/3 of the color dye, for both bottles, used by your hair stylist to create your own color depositing shampoo and conditioner. I use the Prevana “Violet” Color Enhancer to enhance the purple tones in my hair. I wanted to share my hair wash regiment as I hope it can help your hair color last longer. I naturally have thick and black hair but it gets bleached at the salon so this works great with bleached hair as well. You can use absolutely any color hair dye in this product to create your own color depositing shampoo. Hope this helps! The product did exactly what it was suppose to do and that was to NOT fade your color.",3,4,-1

Secondly, I have this brush for 2 months now and it’s still intact. I don’t use it everyday (that could by why), but I only use this brush for my WIGS. I used this brush through some bad tangle hair too and it didn’t break. I would order again but I’m going to keep this brush for another month and give an update. Handle isn’t on right. Can’t push it in hair catches on that part.After going to the returns section and filling out the reason I want to return it, they want me to call the manufacturer for an item that is less than seven dollars instead of returning it to Amazon.Update:  Both Amazon and Conair helped me with a replacement.  Customer service was great at both ends. It never feels as if I can touch my scalp through my hair while brushing it. My hair is so thick. While using this particular hairbrush, I’m able to reach carefully into the roots, smooth with my opposite hand, get the loose, straggly hairs and my head  feels “refreshed “. You may need to have a problem similar to appreciate this, but the brush itself is so easy to clean and worthy of its price. You cannot go wrong purchasing this. Oh, yeah!  I bought a second one. I love this brush. I have long hair and I've had other brushes that break my hair excessively due to getting caught at the base of the bristles and this brush doesn't do that. It's good at detangling wet or dry hair, and works in my daughter's curly hair as well. It's much gentler than other brushes I have and is a great value. I like that I’m able to use the 3in1 adapter for my phone.The plastic bristle wig bush is soft comfy and great for my dogs/(Shepard & Girly Whirly) hair. Shep has really thick hair. Bristles are very hard in my opinion. Handle is comfortable, but brushing hair is not necessarily nice. I will continue to use and see if I can tolerate after getting used to how much pressure to use. I can rely on this brush to always create a good shape. It's comfortable on my scalp and beautiful. I really like this brush. I have put it on my handbag and it fits great. I like this brush so much I am going to purchase another one.",4,2,2

brush thick coarse hair,Phillip Brush Teaze Brush,"I have a number of people in my life who are experienced hair stylists. One even specializes in the hair ""football helmets"" ala Sally Field in Steel Magnolias. If you've got those sort of teasing skills, it really doesn't matter what comb you use. It's your technique that is doing the work so don't waste your money on this.If you're like me, you need some extra help. I've used my standard blue teasing comb on and off for years but I never really felt like my volume would last. This thing works a ton better for me. My volume stays in all day. I find that the brush works better to smooth out and join sections together than the metal pick on my old teasing comb too. I need fewer passes to get my hair the way I want it which makes this process go faster. For what it's worth, I have basically straight hair and I'm mainly teasing layers that are roughly chin-length.I'm not going to pretend like I can suddenly tease on par with my professional friends and relatives but it does meet my needs to help spruce up my hair on the daily. I love this brush!  I have searched for years for a brush that could tease my very fine hair and not tear it up. This Phillips brush is the best I have ever found, and I've been looking for about 30 years...pretty sad!  So when I found this tool, I said, ""Where have you been all of my life!!??"" I have four of them--office, home, gym bag and travel case. I don't want to be without it.  It also does a very nice job on brushing and styling my hair whether I've teased it before or not. I'm very happy with it, clearly, and after using it everyday for almost a month, the ends of my hair are not shredded like they always were with other brushes or teasing combs. I would think this would work on any kind of hair.  Quality bristles, good wood, extremely well made, good looking and a high performer, I think every gal should have one of these at her fingertips.  Slim enough to fit in a purse, it's a girl's best friend. My hair is very fine, completely flat and is very difficult to tease and add lift to..  This has worked well for me for getting the teased grunge look I aim for.  I've tried other brushes, but this one seems to grip the hair better and get all the baby hairs.  Works great for light teasing and more extreme for when I'm doing horror shoots.  The handle doesn't work that well for me to part hair and do sections, but I think it would work well if you had thicker/more hair.  Now I'm able to use this brush for myself and can use the failed teasing brushes for dreadfalls.  Happy with this purchase and it's gone the distance for me. I didn't expect to LOVE this brush so much.  I have since gotten a larger boar brush and a round boar brush because of the effect this little brush had, but this I'm glad I have this size too - it's perfect for smoothing down those flyaway hairs at the top of your head.  Magic.  Better than any hair spray I've ever used. Also good size for just smoothing down any frizzies in your waves without totally brushing all of your hair. Basically it's a good size for being able to control what gets brushed. I never even used it for teasing!  I'm just so amazed how it smooths and softens the look of my hair.  I always heard don't brush your dry hair or it'll frizz out, but I love the effect with boar hair brushes. I have beautiful, thick hair but a round face so I need a little height.  I tried a teasing comb before but my hair got all tangled and knotted and once I got the teasing done I couldn't seem to smooth it all out so I gave up....until this wonderful brush!  I saw a you tube video with the singer Jesse James demonstrating how to tease hair and she recommended a brush.  I love this one!  I did it and my hair can either be easily brushed out before bed or usually I just leave it alone and it still has a little height the next day.  I especially love the way the brush smoothed my hair out after teasing!  Don't forget to use hair spray while the hair is standing up for hold. This is the only brush I use! I know it's a teasing brush but it gets the job done for me since I have fine, straight hair. I tease my hair daily and condition it in the areas I tease heavily to smooth it out. I don't crazily brush through my hair since it doesn't tangle  so this brush works for a light comb through. It is way better than a comb for teasing and can give a little lift or I can go full goth pouf haha. It has lasted for about 4 years now but I could go for another one to get some fresh bristles. The shape of this tool makes it convenient to use for backcombing. The brush is slender and easy to slip around and under chunks of hair, and the pointy end of the handle can be used for ease of parting and separating chunks of hair to work with.That said, the tool provides no advantage when it comes to the actual quality of your backcombing. Back-combing done right is absolutely not intuitive and takes a lot of practice. Frankly,  I can spend 20 minutes teasing furiously and most of my work still falls flat before I can get my hair into a style. This tool didn't really change that at all.So if you're already a good back-comber, this might make your life a bit easier but honestly if you're already a good back-comber it really may not even be necessary. Wow, I had always used the teasing comb with the wicked teeth but this item is fabulous.  I ran across this looking for heavens knows what and decided to order it.  Boy, am I glad I did,  I don't always tease my hair but when I need that extra staying volume this is the way to go.  This brush seems to give volume that has much better staying power than the comb.  The end of the comb is perfect for dividing the hair so you can make sure to get the part desired.  Cool item and glad I happened upon it.  I would definitely order another if I happened to lose this one.",2,2,0

The irons work, heat up in a reasonable amount of time, and are easy to operate.However, I have very thick, coarse hair. These irons do not get as hot as my older Revlon adjustable temp iron. It hadn't occurred to me, that since they aren't adjustable, they would be a lower temp. They are still usable. They just take longer to make curls that last. You have to use the thinnest sections of hair and you really have to leave the iron in the curl longer. It's trial and error to determine how long. I like that I can use the 2 largest irons and have different sized curls, which looks a little more natural.Would I purchase again?Yes & No*If I was buying for a tween with normal or thin hair, so they can learn with simple, straightforward equipment, these would be perfect.*If I really needed new irons for myself and these were what I could afford, they would get the job done. Especially, if I had normal or fine hair.*If I were looking for inexpensive irons to leave in my travel bag for quick packing and less  worry if my luggage is lost, these are great.*If I were growing my hair back out and in that awkward in-between stage where you don't know what to do with your hair and might still get frustrated enough to cut it very short again(this is me), this is a great solution.*If I knew I was going to use an iron several times a week or even daily, and had my hair type, and could afford something better that heats faster and has variable temp settings, I'd definitely go for the upgrade.In my situation, I've missed the return window, so I'll keep these around for travel and to use on my granddaughter. I'll be shopping around for nicer irons for myself once I decide to keep growing my hair out. Ok I must say the price was right for these curling irons. I thought it would be fabulous to have the three different sizes for the price of one, but the curling irons did not get hot enough to keep a curl in my hair. It was made out of cheap material and did not have a temperature control. Also based on the picture the item had a shut-on and off button this did not. It have a small little dot that turned a different color to tell you that it is hot enough. I know back in the day Conair was a good product, but This was not what I expected. I returned the item. I'm teaching a cosmetology class to middle schoolers so the iron not getting too hot is perfect for us. I don't feel like the girls are gonna burn themselves horribly. Gets hot enough to allow the students to learn and perfect the curling technique. My wife loves that she has different sizes to curl with As with anything with a cord travel with it is hard. But size of dryer is great for travel. i like the different size but i don't like that there isn't any on or off switch They are good curling irons & a great deal since you get 3 different sizes. My only complaint is it’s pictured & described with temperature settings & on off switch & it has neither of these. You just plug it up & unplug it. They work though. Good for first timers or people like me who don’t do their hair very often",2,3,-1

It is one of the only cleansing shampoos that doesn't create undesired or unintended health conditions to my scalp or interfere with my hair growth with use of extended periods.  High confidence in the product to gently clean my scalp/hair as needed, even though I frequently lap swim in chlorinated pools.  Additionally, I can only afford Nioxin when I purchase the product in the large 33.8oz containers.However, my biggest disappointment, has the loss of over half the content from the failure of your modified cap design. The original metallic gold colored and the new metallic dark grey colored cap / pivoting-lid is designed to dispense shampoo by pushing down on the pivoting lid cutout labeled 'PRESS'. (As I assumed would operate similarly to your previous cap / lid-pivot designs).  After the lid initially separated from the cap I noticed the pivoting lid was not completely seated into the cap, and upon examination the 2 pivot nipples each located across the cap diameter, weren't seating into their cap seats.  I reseated the lid into the cap, testing its functionality by repeatedly pressing to open and closing the lid, but the next use turning the bottle upside down, the lid completely separated from the cap and before I could stop the high rate of product escaping from the bottle, I'd lost more than half the Nioxin shampoo...........I observed the product weight (inside the 33.8oz bottle) when rotated upside down (as you've designed the Nioxin bottle to be used ) was in fact resulting in over pressuring/overloading of your recently modified bottle/cap/lid redesign, and along with the inadequate fitting pivot nipple to cap detent design and production methods, precipitated a 'typical-use' failure event...........I was particularly chagrined to learn you for some unknown justification changed the bottle opening and cap diameter, making it impossible to to use the previous Nioxin bottle cap/pivoting lid.....My solution has been to use a an integrated cap/pump from a (no longer used) Nexus shampoo 44oz bottle along with tailoring the tube length to reach Nioxin shampoo bottle bottom.  The pump permits a much improved ability to control a regulated measure of the shampoo from the large cumbersome bottle, while at the same time, avoids having to depend on the functionality of the shampoo cap/lid assembly to operate as expected, mitigating against having to pick up the large/heavy/non-ergonomically designed bottle, and having to rotate the non-user ergonomic prioritized/heavy container, upside down in an clumsy attempt just to deliver an amount shampoo........ I would expect the cost of the Nioxin shampoo would include prioritizing an adequate product bottle cap / pivoting-lid systems engineering design/review/oversight, or at the least just tape a pump onto the bottle to provide an enhanced user/product interface. I like the way it smell and it does work, within 2 months I started noticing the growth cuz I had all these new baby hairs sticking up.The only bad thing is it’s a little pricey I have a thyroid issue which causes my hair to be thin. Since finding this product I have seen a significant decrease in the amount of hair in the shower drain. I have been using it for about 6 mths now and I won’t use anything else. So, I am 65 years old, and have used a lot of shampoos over the years -- that's why I say my all-time favorite.  I have used Nioxin shampoo for about 4 or 5 years now.  I have limp, straight hair, but it is not thinning.  Over the years, I have had to work hard to get it to show any life or bounce.  I have used Nioxin formulas #1, #3, #4, and #6 and love them all.  They really DO add volume and body.  I have not used the related conditioners, because I've found conditioner tends to weigh my hair down & add to the lack of body.  But if these shampoos are this effective, I may be tempted to go back & try one of their conditioners. I love the fresh minty scent and slight tingle when using this shampoo.  But I don't understand the dramatic increase in price in just 2 months?  It works well for thin hair, doesn't weigh down my hair but I'm not sure that justifies the cost now Fresh mint scent and helps with hair loss. Hair feels clean after use. Love Nioxin! The main thing every user should know is that it doesn’t take the place of your daily shampoo.  If your hair is light thinning (or at the beginning of) use it 1-2x a week max, but MOST inportantly...once you start using it you cannot stop! Once you do you will find it noticeably thin/thinning again. This will (should) become one of your regular bottles you have on hand no matter what! (you’ll THANK me later)... This has worked fantastic for me. I shampoo using Nioxin 3 on Sunday and then again on Thursday. Regular shampooing the remainder of the days. Read directions on back of bottle. If it says leave on (3) minutes then DO it! My hair stylist recommended this to me after I had major surgery and my hair was thinning badly.  Started using it and before long my hair was back thick and shinier than ever.  Also got this for my son's partner who has very thin hair, they started using it and their hair is much thicker.  Expensive compared to grocery store brands, but a bottle lasts a long time and the results are well worth it.",4,5,-1

Curling Iron,"I've used Conair curling irons for many years, and purchased this one after my old one finally gave out. Yes, the design, including the tip, is different from other Conair curling irons. But, I quickly figured that out (after a couple minor burns). Retraining myself to hold it differently corrected that problem.  It works nicely and I have no regrets. This is a good quality curling iron and works just fine. I love the sleeve it comes with but warning!! If you don’t look for it-because it’s almost weightless-it would be easy to toss the box it comes in thinking it’s empty. I’m so glad I read the enclosed info that mentioned the sleeve and I thought I got ripped off. I started digging through the box and there it was! I use it every time I curl my hair. Just unplug it when I’m finished, slide the hot curling iron in the sleeve and put it away. It’s completely covered. Definitely recommend it!! She told me that this product makers her hair curlier than it was before she used the curling iron. She is jealous of my natural curls so she wanted this iron, I can tell she uses a curling iron, but I don’t think others have figured out she has straight hair. I tried to explain to her to just stick her finger in a power socket and just save us the money. She still insists on wasting money on this quality curling iron. Nice job Conair you got my money and my wife prefers your product over the old fashioned finger light socket trick… ps DONT PUT YOUR PHALANGES IN POWER SOCKETS, it won’t curl you hair like this guys natural mountain hippie head of hair is NATURALLY. careful  with that ax Eugene I have very thick hair and this heats up fast and hot. Be careful not to burn yourself.  My curls are big and beautiful Highly recommend for heavy thick hair Can be used to straighten curly hair!  The temperature is the same as my straightener.  To straighten, it only takes seconds to move down the l length of my hair.  I love the protective cover when I’m done since I have cats who like to jump on the sink . Curls when I want —like my bangs.  Again, I used it at 360 and it was perfect. I have very thick hair and could never hold a curl until now. My curls stay in all day and it doesn't make my hair frizzy I love it, the wand isn’t as smooth on my hair as I would like, but gives me the curls I want, heats fast. Love it!! Just trying to find new ways to do my hair and this helps. Very nice quality for a good price",5,4,1

way dryerthis one perfect love attachment not even need straightner use,"Conair 1875-Watt Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer with Diffuser and Concentrator, Black","Product was as expected and at very reasonable price.However, package of item for shipment left much to be desired.Box was slightly crushed and both ends open...but everything did remain inside and dryer works! I bought this to replace an old Conair hair dryer that I have had for over 10 years. This is a good replacement - similar to the one I had, but a little lighter in weight. It has two power settings and three heat settings, which is nice. The warm heat setting is perfect for my hair - not too hot, but warm enough to dry my hair.It is a little too large for me to want to use it for travel, but that is OK with me. The only thing I found less than useful is the diffuser . It is huge! Maybe it would be fine if you had really long hair, but useless on shorter hair. Good power. Light. Very pleased I've been using this hair dryer for a couple of weeks. I have short hair with lots of body and a few bothersome waves around my face. I use to have to really work to control them. This dryer does a great job, especially with the concentrator, to straighten the waves. Overall, my hair dries more quickly and with very little frizz. I love the three heat settings option and use the cool shot feature every time I dry my hair. So far I am very happy with this purchase. Cord is not long enough I bought this for home use and it is actually my 2nd one the original was bought about 8 years ago. I have thick hair and it blows a dry very quickly and I love that I can adjust both the power and the temperature This product was something I bought years ago. No store near me carries this one currently. It's an older model. But, very efficient. It works well! The dryer is a bit louder, but isn't disruptive like some older models (i.e.) the neighbors should be fine hahaha.This is the type of situation where the older model of a product works better than the newer ones released after it. That is sometimes the case with certain manufacturers or companies.When this model was back in stock and I was notified, I bought it immediately. This hair dryer lasted from the original release date until 2022. And, that's only cuz I dropped it. It would have still been fine I hadn't. The box most likely will have some scratches or marks (only from warehouse storage).But, it is nothing that effected my hair dryer. It was in its original box is the reason why. If you have ever worked customer service, then you know exactly what I mean. This is NOT a problem as long as nothing is cracked or defective shortly after you use it ;P Otherwise, you should good to go! It does get warm, but it cools off quickly.Again, to make sure it's clearly stated: Any box will get worn over time (due to warehouse storage). So, all in all, this hair dryer works just fine for me. I have been using this hairdryer now for less than a year but several months.  It's adequate.  The cord is a bit shorter than I'd like making movement a bit restrained.  The slider switches for the temperature (on the left) and the speed (on the right) are cheaply made.  They're plastic and if I don't take extra pampering with them, they WILL break.  They are flimsy.  They act like they want to pop off sometimes but I push down on them and they snap back down.  The Cool button is in the way...period.  Whoever designed this should not have put that button where it's located.  It's right in the grab area on the handle making it awkward handling the dryer as you dry your hair.  The force of the blowing is pretty extreme.  Even on low, this dryer blows pretty hard.  I have to be careful where I aim it or things on my countertop will blow off...even on low setting.  The low blow setting is more like a medium blow setting.  As for making my hair silky, well, it does seem to make my hair a bit more healthy.  I can't deny.  It has kept my hair from getting out-of-control frizzy.  I have slightly wavy hair naturally, so when I dry it, I try to straighten it as I dry.  It still sometimes turns out a slightly frizzy, but nothing a flat iron can't finish off.  I don't have to use my flat iron as much..I will say that.  I've used the diffuser a couple of times and it does help to dry my hair without the direct blowing.  Not sure it does better than using my fingers though. Maybe i'm just not doing it right..who knows.  Overall, it's an ok dryer.  I'm not liking the flimsy buttons and the awkwardness of the location of the Cool button, but I am trying to use the Cool button more now to ""cool off and set"" a lifted portion of hair to give it body and it seems to help.  Time will tell if the filters will do their job.  I bought this dryer because my last (Revlon brand) dryer's filter disintegrated for some reason.  I guess it was just too old. I loved my old dryer but it wasn't this new ionic feature type.  I decided to change to this since reviewers and ads said it would make my hair silky.  ...and it does.  So for that, I give it 4 stars.",4,4,0

I can't say for certain that it made a difference but most of the people that know me don't believe me when I tell them my actual age because of how my hair and skin looks.  I also use it on my arms, hands and face to keep my skin from drying out in the desert air.  It works better than any other product that I have tried!! Nice and feels good Think I could have purchased this same product at Walmart for cheaper price, but for the convenience, it’s a good choice for me. Finally found the brand I've been looking for.

Black (BC171NCSR)","My hairstylist suggested that I try a hot air brush at my recent hair cut.  Of course I fell in love with the Conair brush that auto rotates, but at over $60, I just couldn’t afford it.  I found this brush at a much more reasonable price and decided to give it a try.  It works well, dries my hair quickly and works exactly as described.  No auto rotation but I’m okay to use my wrist to twist and move it through my hair.  If you have issues with your wrists/hands then this might not work for you.  I only need to use the low setting because the high really is HOT so experiment first and be safe.  The large and small brushes both work for my short hair - although I like the small one best right now but as my hair grows the bigger one will be perfect.  I do like the directional attachment to use separately with your own hair brush but right now it defeats the purpose of “all in one”.  The attachments were a little stiff to change in the beginning but after working with it a couple of days they twist and click in place with no worries.  I deducted one star because the attachments do get really hot (at the base where it attaches to the barrel) while you’re using them, so changing from one to another will take a little time to allow it to cool before you do so.  All in all, a great product and I’m really thrilled with it. First time I tried it I found it somewhat awkward. Been using it for a couple of weeks now, and it is getting better. I have fine, above-the-shoulder-length hair. I took it on a trip, it was my only means to dry and style, and took longer than the conventional blow dryer and brush but came out fine. The smaller brush is useless to me, it does not grip, so I only use the larger brush. 1000 wats are not strong for quick drying, so you must have extra time. Now, I usually use my regular blow dryer for a few min and switch to the airbrush for styling. Not exactly what had in mind but it works, on a side note, I do use the airbrush in between washings to style and add volume to my hair. It's perfect for that.  All in all, I don't regret buying this airbrush. Hope this helps. I like this dryer brush even though it is large. I have small hands so it is a bit big for me. The brush bristles are soft and nice. It really does a great job of drying and styling at the same time. Wish it had a cold air button. I needed this for travel and am glad I purchased it. Loved this when it was on the lower setting.  Has everything you want especially for traveling.  The high setting has a horrible high pitch sound.  I had to use ear plugs to use it. There is a learning curve to using it but on my second try I got that styled blowout look and feel, like I just came from the hair dresser. Dries hair super quickly and was really pleased. Definitely taking this on vacation. I really do like the weight ,how warm it gets quickly I used all parts😘 My hair is on the short side, thought the brushes looked small enough to work. I was able to use it with some difficulty but had to tame the hair down w a curling iron bc the hair didn't fit all the way around. I got volume but had to work twice as hard. The other thing is it has very large base to handle, I have arthritis so it is difficult for me to hold. For medium lenght hair I think this would be great, just not shorter hair. I bought it for my mom for Christmas because I did not want to spend money on the super expensive ones. She said the bristles were very soft so it wasnt grabbing her hair. She does have short and thin hair so…and the small head is too small and the big head was too big. There also looks like the brushes have a metal piece that works like a straightener so it makes your hair look shiney afterwards. Not sure if we are keeping but maybe if you have thicker hair it will be better?",3,4,-1

It’s so easy to use and I am SO happy with the results. This was my first time trying it and there are some areas of my hair I could’ve done better but overall it exceeded my expectations. Also love how affordable it is compared to most other brand name wavers. It works good but it’s harder to get closer to your roots when using because it’s kind of bulky but it does the job. Excelente producto , fácil de usar , tiene para controlar la temperatura y broche de seguridad. My daughter has thick hair and it produces waves. A little hard to maneuver and takes awhile to do your whole head. I love the waves from this! I realized that if you hold it with your thumb on the lever instead of the handle, your hands will not get as tired and I think it curl’s better as well and it adds more lift at the root area. So squeeze the clamp with your thumb, not your fingers! For context, I live in South Florida where the humidity is my hair's arch nemesis. I have course, long hair and not matter what hair spray, texture spray, etc I use - I cannot keep a curl. My mom is a hair stylist so I have access to great products that typically would work in other climates, but not in SoFlo.It heats pretty quickly and light so your arm wont be sore after completing your whole head. My waves do hold for hours with and without the addition of hair spray. A couple things I notices, the heat isn't as evenly distributed as I would like. It's not too big of a difference, just have to be a little more tactical on where I place the section of hair. Also the handle that is used to clamp down the barrels is not as sturdy as I would like it. It bends as if I may snap it - would prefer it to be made out of a stronger material.Overall, I do enjoy this hair waver. If I'm being completely honest, I wish I would have returned it to get another. I just forgot to within the return window lol. But I'm not displeased with it, just pickier than most. Okay…. MY HAIR DONT CURLLL!!!!My husband bought me this for Christmas, because you know I want to curl my hair!! And my hair don’t Curl!! And even if it does it falls right out, no matter the product or however long it’s been since it was washed!I used this the day after Christmas!! My hair stayed curled for two days!!! TWO DAYS!! with nothing but heat treatment and clean hair!!!TWO DAYS!!BUY IT!! Excelente ✨✨✨✨✨",1,3,-2

Strength Hair Serum, Anti Frizz Nourishing Hair Treatment for Dry, Damaged, Frizzy Hair, Frizz Control and Heat Protectant with Bamboo Extract, 1.69 Ounce","A little dab will do you. Probably only need a pea size amount. It’s a very concentrated serum. Will leave your hair soft and silky and won’t weigh your curls down. Cannot comment on frizz control. Even living in the state of Texas it’s only the end of January with no humidity.The reason for the four-star, the product came with no cap over the pump. Not sure how well it will hold up when traveling.  However, it appears you can turn the pump to the left to lock.  I am traveling in 2-weeks and will put it though the test. I have tailbone length hair and this is the only serum I ever use on the ends of it to keep it soft. I will continue to use it and yeah, I definitely swear by this. Makes my gray , wavy  curly hair look great and calms my frizz. It’s as good as it was in the 1990s. I think it helps with the frizz of my mixed texture hair which conditioner alone doesn’t help. My favorite thing about it is it doesn’t leave my hair as greasy feeling like some leave in conditioners do. I 💜 John Frieda products. I am currently using the Midnight Brunette shampoo & conditioner. Also, the Secret Weapon cream & 3 Day Straight heat protection spray. I really liked the old bottle that looked like a test tube within a clear container - the bottle in the picture advertised. But I guess they stopped making it... Little dissapointed but still a great product 💜💯 It seems to be weightless.  Works without the greasy feeling.  I am now using all of this brands products and love them! Softness, not heavy on the hair and it really does keep the frizz away This stuff works well! A little goes a long way. Comes in two tiny bottles. I applied it to wet hair and I saw amazing shine after using a blow drier and flat iron.",4,4,0

Lo recomiendo Damage from allergies to other shampoo & conditioner as well as what I believe to be ppl adding chemicals to the products as a prank & damaging my hair & scalp … AND sensitivity to town water,  I was at wits end as to how to save my hair. It was my one positive attribute that I never had to work at & all of a sudden it was dry, brittle, breaking, falling out, scalp flaking & spending so much time trying to moisturize w/ out leaving greasy I never seemed to have time to really do my makeup. I was just slapping on the basics & running. These products from day one helped with the dryness. This conditioner, I have my own way to use. My hair is so dry it drinks it up; after I towel dry I brush my hair forward, a small amt rubbed into my wet hands I spot massage into the ends, put on a turbi twist so it doesn’t get into my scalp & clog pores & sleep with it. Next morning spritz w/ water, blow dry & I have amazing soft, shiny, easy to style hair. No breakage, nothing in the sink, on the floor, or in my brush. At the end of the day I fill the sink with water, dunk my hair, towel dry & air dry. I do this 2-3 x’s a wk & it’s improving the consistency of my hair faster than I could ever have hoped for. A miracle! Two weeks ago I bleached my Pixie hair cut but it didn’t get to the level I wanted, it had orange undertones.  So I used a  toner on it but It still was orange. I bleached it again using a Violet Powder bleach, it pulled out a little more orange and I used a toner on it that gave it. Champagne beige color.  The color was finely right….but now my hair Follicles were like STRAW! I was desperate for help, so I found something new to go along with the “Joico K-Pak Reconstructor I use first for 3-5 minutes then used….”Joico K-Pak Hydrator Intense Treatment. It’s added more shine and is helping with with the elasticity. I’ve used them both 4 times and my hair feels BETTER THAN it did even before I started this whole bleaching process!  WOW! It’s the BEST for getting your hair shaft strong,smooth and supple!  It truly works better than any $50/$100 Salon product out there.  👍🏼🥰 Quarantine calls for bleaching black hair platnium so you can dye it a bright color for funzoes 😎👊🏻💯 Until air-dry my hair and find locks brittle af... I thought I just missed a section in the shower so I went back to dampen my hair, but after airdrying again it went back to a frail state 😔 It was so crunchy... After looking at Amazon Reviews & Reddit for hot tips, I found a person who suggested Pronexa+Joico K-PAK so I ordered both! But the Joico K-PAK came first so I have only tried that!And the Joico K-PAK saved my hair! I naturally have soft and fine hair, but my second time experimenting with bleach left my hair in a crunchy and vulnerable state :( So sad. I tried applying coconut oil but it was not back to normal the morning after 😣 When I got the K-PAK, I applied coconut oil once more (for safety measures) and then washed + used K-PAK and it FIXED my hair! It was like an instant fix... kind of unbelievable :0 My hair stayed soft for maybe a week before a verry small section got brittle again, so I’d say once a week is enough. Thanks Joico! Nice and smooth conditioner. I need something thick because my hair frizzes like crazy in this humidity. I also dye my hair. I have not been disappointed with this product. It is heavier though so if you have fine hair, might not be the right version for you. I accidentally bought this thinking it was the kpak protein treatment. So I was at first disappointed til I started using it as a regular conditioner in the shower. It is the best all around conditioner I’ve ever used and I’ve used A LOT (like so many literally I can’t even begin to count). If you don’t mind silicones in your hair I don’t see how anyone couldn’t like this. I have very treated hair (platinum sometimes w crazy colors) and this makes it feel better than it’s been since it was virgin like a billion years ago. This is my 3rd tube. I use mainly blondme shampoo the big one in pump (sulfate free) and sometimes purple shampoo, but this is defo my fave conditioner. I can even use to pastelize dyes!Oh and I’ve since gotten the kpak real protein treatment ha. This conditioner is great for after that since any time you add protein to your hair you need to moisturize afterwards. I loved using this conditioner. Very thick and hydrating. NOT waxy or greasy. Absorbs into hair and rinses nicely. Trust me when I say I did not try this because of the reviews on Amazon.  I tried it because the girl the does my hair and I trust totally, mentioned her boss was using this brand now in her salon.  It is a professional brand and I was only trying to see if I could find it at a cheaper price than their website....plus seeing if I could find trial sizes.  Well, I did and I did. So without sinking a lot of money into 3 small bottles....the shampoo, conditioner and the intense hydrating creme I was very happy with the results. For women that have been coloring and blow drying,etc for years we really cannot use over the counter shampoos and conditioners because they just do not cut it....NO MATTER WHAT THEY ADVERTISE. So, I am passing my knowledge on in truth.  Hope it helps.",2,5,-3

everything else price to high, I use to get at CVS 8 years ago 2 for $5, then it went to $3 each.  Now I think shoprite has 2 for $7 when on sale, don't buy 1 it will cost $4.  I stopped buying on Amazon they cost the most on Amazon...so far 2022 target is the cheapest hovering I think $3 each regular price, my medium brown sells out quick...another note, I almost bought on Amazon, read reviews, review person said 2 pack, it turned out inside box were 2 pieces.  I immediately took it out of my cart the cost was way to high...I forget but way to high.  Last year I did buy on Amazon when it was $3 each...no more, go to target.  I can't rate cause I've been using this brand from day one, many years ago cause its the cheapest...if I had the money I would buy expensive brand.  It works.  I will add when I started dying it lasted 6 weeks, now I'm much older 4 weeks, and as you wash your hair it gets lighter and lighter...I belive,  not sure, all hair colors will do this. Love this brand for my hair, always does what it’s supposed to! Plus not harsh! Always buy again This is my go to hair dye. Works every time and its pretty straight forward. The conditioner smells good as well and really makes my hair soft afterward. This is my go to hair dye. I use this hair dye every 6 months when my black brown color is fading. I use this L’Oréal brown black color shade. Rate 10/10. I mix 2 colors,this alone is VERY dark, it come out better with adding some dark auburn.

My normal shed rate prior to using a boar bristle brush (BBB) was 25-30 hairs a day, and on wash days I was losing 40-50 hairs.  Within two weeks it dropped to 10-15 hairs a day, and wash days I was losing 15-20 hairs.  Within a month, my shed rate dropped to 5-10 hairs a day, and wash days were 10-15 hairs.  Now it has been just over a month, and yesterday was a wash day.  I only lost 6 hairs yesterday.  This morning when I brushed, I did not lose even one hair.  NOT EVEN ONE!!!  I'm sure I'll lose a few when I brush tonight, but this is incredibly awesome.  I have average thickness hair (a 7.5 cm ponytail circumference), and would love it if I got another centimeter added to my circumference.  Maybe the BBB is the answer for me?!Other benefits:  My hair type is 1c-F/M-ii (Google Fia's hair typing to learn what that means).  It is past hip in length, and I want it longer.  One prompter of trims for me has been when my ends start to look and feel dry and when they split.  Since using the BBB, my hair is shinier, smoother, glossier, and more moisturized.  My natural sebum is being moved down my length and is conditioning my hair.  I am finding that I do not need near as much leave-in conditioner or as much oil applied to my length.  I've even skipped it a few times.  This makes it so my hair doesn't feel as weighed down, yet it is very well conditioned from my own sebum.  It is winter right now, and I have less static than I did prior to using the BBB.  This has become an indispensable tool in my hair-care arsenal!I have a tutorial on YouTube I uploaded showing the proper use of a BBB in he bent-at-waist position.  Unfortunately, I'm a gabby person and my video was too long to be posted here as a review video, but feel free to look it up.  My YouTube screen name is just my name, Laura Grout, and the video is entitled ""How to Properly Use a Boar Bristle Brush.""It is important to have fully detangled hair before you use the BBB on it or you will cause damage and breakage.  A BBB is not a detangling brush.  Use a wide tooth seamless comb for detangling. Also, bending at the waist does not mean you need to flip your hair over.  If you flip your hair over you will cause tangles.  There is a way to do it that minimizes tangles.  I show how to do it in my video. Regular use is important if you want to reap all the benefits of using a BBB.This brush has bristles that are stiff enough they will penetrate to my scalp when brushing, but not so stiff that they hurt.  I wash my brush when it gets linty build-up in it, usually once or twice a week, using gentle shampoo and a nail brush to scrub.  The brush has shed a few hairs out while cleaning it.  This hasn't impacted its performance thus far, but I expect I will need to replace this brush eventually.  It feels really good on my scalp.  It craves brushing every morning and night.If you buy this brush and use it regularly, you will not be disappointed.  Curlies, your mileage may vary.  Some curlies and wavies love BBBing, and others say it's the devil.  As a straighty, I'm pleased as punch with this essential haircare tool.Update:  It has now been a year since I began using this brush, and I still love it just as much as when I wrote this review. my hair loves this quality brush While, as stated, it IS a quality brush, it is rather on the heavy side. Plus, in my opinion, the bristles are not long enough and do not penetrate wet hair as I would have expected. Perhaps I should have chosen a hairbrush that combined real boar bristles AND nylon bristles. When I first got this brush and opened it, my husband remarked about how big it was.  Yeah, I said it's a paddle brush and they're bigger.  Actually, this is a big brush.  The paddle is about 3 by 5 inches.  I'll try to add photos with a ruler after I finish this writing.  Not only is it big, it's heavy and clunky to me.  However, big and clunky is not the worst feature of this brush.  As other reviews have said, you can not clean this brush or at least you aren't suppose to get the cushion the bristles are attached to wet.  Silly me, I didn't really believe they would sell a hair brush you could not clean.  After buying the brush I sent email to the manufacturer asking how this brush should be cleaned.  The following is the email I received back from Spornette.Subject: SPORNETTE #344 BRUSHDate: Tue, 12 Apr 2011 11:30:49 -0500Hello Dee,Thank you for your email regarding the best way to clean the #344 brush.We suggest that you only run a comb from the bottom of the bristles to the top to remove any excess hair.  You can then dampen the comb and go through bristles, but you cannot get the cushion wet or submerge it in water.Thank you for supporting Spornette International.Spornette Customer ServiceOK, I still kept the brush and didn't return it even after this answer.  I had really been wanting to see if a natural bristle brush would make any difference with the frizziness of my long naturally wavy hair.  It was ok but I can't say that it did that much for it and I found myself not wanting to use the brush unless my hair had just been washed since I didn't feel like I could really get it clean.  Of course the whole idea of a natural bristle brush is to condition your hair by distributing your natural hair oil throughout the length of your hair and when it is first washed there isn't much, if any, natural oil to distribute.  I did think the bristles were stiff enough that it did feel good on my scalp but not to harsh when I did use the brush.  As I brushed through my long hair I had to be careful that I didn't bang the big brush into something as I brushed down. E.G. the vanity top.  The one thing that helped me use this brush for a year is that I found a wonderful brush cleaner by the Fuller Brush company.  I see that they now have several of their products on Amazon now and I'm hoping they will eventually add their hairbrush cleaner.  In the meantime, I've been replacing all my hairbrushes with ones made by Fuller, which are made in the USA.  They have natural bristle brushes with light weight plastic handles, which I think will be fine with my washing them with shampoo & water. Fuller also has wood handle hair brushes if you prefer wood.  This best use of this Spornette hair brush is if you need a wooden paddle or if you only plan to use it on just washed hair and if you want a big heavy wooden brush. I am a transplant from California to far northern Minnesota.  It is very very dry here in winter.  My hair is long (half way down my back), very thick and wavy.  It was becoming especially dry and unmanageable.  I researched hairbrushes - different types and their uses on lots of websites.  And I read many hairbrush reviews.  I found this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKpcpmeNJ48  entitled ""How to Properly Use a Boar Bristle Brush"".  It's worth slowing yourself down and watching all the way through.  I have learned that the Spornette DeVille boar bristle paddle brush is for brushing your hair, for distributing your natural oil throughout your hair.  It is not a styling brush to be used with a blow dryer.  It is not an implement for de-tangling your hair.  I've been managing my hair per Laura's video for about two weeks now.  The change in my hair is very noticeable.  This inexpensive brush and Laura's techniques have made my hair softer, shinier, less bulky.  There's often a bristle or two on the bathroom counter after i brush.  I don't consider this an issue.  There is a bit of static each time i begin to brush but it dissipates after the first few brush strokes.  there's a bonus, too, to this new regime -  the simple act of brushing each morning and evening is rather peaceful and almost meditative:)",3,1,2

and because my curly is different from others most often, it's hard to find a brush with reviews that I can rely on  (I'm also part Native American, so my hair is very thick!). To give you an idea, a classmate once asked if I curled my hair with ""a pencil or something"" every morning, bit by bit. When dry and untouched, it shrinks to my shoulders. Pulled or straightened, it doubles in length, reaching or passing the middle of my back.Anyways, I usually use brushes with plastic bristles and the little beaded ends, the rectangular vented ones or whatever (sorry, I'm not the type to use a wide tooth comb to detangle my hair and use a separate brush to, well, brush it). The struggle is that they are often cheap and within a couple weeks to a month in, the bristles bend and won't run through my hair, only over it. They also break or the beads fall off. Of course, when I straighten my hair, using one of these causes a lot of static!When I learned about wood brushes, I decided for this one, as it is reasonably priced. My issue with paddle brushes, is that in the past, the entire rubber bit holding the bristles and glued to the handle breaks off. Usually within a day or two. If it wasn't that, my hair would easily bite the bristles off that rubber back piece.It's been about a month since I've had this brush (doesn't seem long, but these types of brushes last a day. Literally.). And I really like it! All the bristles are still in tact. Nothing looks like it's going to fall off soon. While I use this brush still a little more carefully (taking smaller sections of my hair to brush), I have used it normally quite a few times, just running it through my hair with no caution and everything is fine.I can't say for sure if it's better for the frizz factor yet (though I think there is a bit of a difference for the better), but I'll use it the next time I straighten my hair- that's when the static and frizz is very noticeable (I wear my hear up most often). When I do, I'll make sure to update this review.Oh! And as for the little beads lacking on the tips, I like that about this brush because I can be sure it won't get caught in my hair, get stuck and break or something. And if you're anything like me (not tender headed at all!), the lack of the beads actually feel a bit nice. But that's just me, ha.Hope this helps. I have long thick hair that for years was damaged from chlorine hair dyes hair dryer plastic bristled brushes etc.  Last year I decided to opt out of all of those and take on a new hair regime.  Part of the new regime includes homemade hair and scalp treatments of either argan or coconut oil. After 4-6 months my hair and scalp are totally transformed happy and healthier.  But then there was an issue with my harsh brushes. I have seen wooden brushes before but they always seemed ridiculously expensive.  Especially if they had to be replace every six months or so.  Well I came across the Bass brush at such a good price that I thought I would give it a try.  And WOW glad I did.  I'm not sure how I can describe it but I'll try...I have a sensitive scalp and so switching from sharp plastic needle like bristles to soft wider rounded bristles is night and day. The difference is between running a fork vs gentle fingers over your scalp an in your hair.  And then something else I noticed.....my hair is more manageable and the oils seem to be distributed from top down to bottom which has resulted in nice ends on my hair. It's easier for me to brush my hair with this wooden brush.  Lastly, I really look forward to brushing my hair dry or wet tangled or not. Instead of a quick chore I take my time and just slowly run the brush through lots of hair.  Sometimes even if I don't need a full brushing I might slowly run the brush over my head almost as a massage to de-stress my scalp.  I know it sounds kinda weird or woo-woo but if I've been working too long at the computer or had a stressful day my neck and head get tight.  A couple of slow almost massage like runs over my scalp really relieves a lot of held in tension that I never realized I had.  So yeah, I have to recommend this brush.  Wood over plastic, thicker pins vs bristles, a nice weight and balance to the brush and great price makes it a no-brainer to own. This is a great brush, you should buy it.I have purchased one of these every few years for a fair amount of time now.  First my wife got one, then I got one, and then we got a back up for travel.  It really is a good brush.  The bamboo handle feels solid in your hand and well constructed; you are able to get a good grip on it.  The bamboo pins are firm but are attached to give them some flexibility.  They go through both fine and thick hair equally well and both long-haired and short-haired people in the household have been happy with it.  It seems to be fairly durable as we have had them for several years and it is only missing a pin or two and is still fully functional.  These brushes are also visually appealing; the colors and design of the wood go well together and it just looks like a nice brush.  Finally, it may not be the only reason to buy it, but I like that these brushes are made of bamboo, which is an easily renewable resource and more environmentally friendly than most other wooden products.I always try to offer potential flaws in a product, but really this brush doesn't have any.  It's not a miracle brush that will last forever, but at under 20 bucks and multiple years of use, it really is a no-brainer, you should buy this product.",1,3,-2

I’m now starting over to grow my hair and thought I’d invest in a professional shampoo and conditioner. I bought the large bottles so it wasn’t much more expensive than the Evercreme. I’ve been using it for 2 months but I’m not really sure if I will continue using it once I finish the bottles. I haven’t noticed a difference in how my hair feels. I think it’s a combination of everything that’s going to help my hair grow longer again. Not using hair bands, wearing my hair up so it doesn’t rub and tangle on my clothes, using a hair mask and leave in conditioner, etc. It’s nice but not the miracle I was hoping for.",1,5,-4

I have been using my Mar-V-Cide brush for years and years and years after finding it in a Caswell-Massey a LONG time ago (it's lived through me having hair down to my butt, then several variations of a shouler-length bob, and now a pixie cut), and I recently bought a few more, one for my daughter with her very long hair and one for my husband with his barely-there hair. My daughter and I both swim regularly, and it's hard to really get the pool chemicals and/or salt completely out of our hair, and the Marvy brush really helps with that.I know there's a whole backlash about shampoo use and too much shampoo, but if you want super clean hair, you want a super clean scalp, and you want a tingly scalp massage while you are shampooing, this brush delivers. I'm an old-school ""squeaky clean"" hair kinda girl, so I like using this brush and getting lots of foam from my shampoo and scrubbing my hair and scalp super clean, especially after I have been in a chlorinated pool for hours. I hate the feeling of my scalp being tight and dry after too much exposure to pool chemicals and this brush helps get rid of that.The brush basically made out of the same material that those big red bouncy balls that schools use in kickball is made out of- a stuff rubber, that gives with a bit of pressure. The brush is sturdy, but designed to curve around your hand, so you can really scrub your hair without it scratching your scalp or being uncomfortable or it actually hurting your skin.My daughter has eczema, so in order to exfoliate the scalp she either has to use a harsh chemical shampoo or use a shampoo brush- for us, it's much more pleasant for her to use one of these brushes on her hair when she's in the shower than have to apply a chemical mask and wear a shower cap for a while while it goes to work. It also helps her get all her hair clean even if she takes a quick shower.This item is a staple in my routine, and I haven't been without one for over two decades. I just think they are great. They help clean hair and scalp, stimulate blood flow, and generally make you feel relaxed. I saw all the other fancier designed brushes but thought this looked easier with the handle nub and it is, it's simple and does a good job of massaging your scalp, it's not flimsy and sturdy and I noticed within ONE day that my scalp was cleaner, I know this sounds gross but by the night I'm scratching buildup out of my hair, I shower and wash my hair everyday and have thick curly hair which I know many say not to wash daily but I have mixed hair, one area is super fine and the other curly so the fine area actually gets oily quickly and I always had buildup issues - I use sulfate free shampoo and conditioner from paul mitchell (awapuhi is the best and get the larger bottles to save $) but I still had build up and after one wash I am weirdly shocked that I don't - I am so used to it that I expected to have to brush it out. I only use a light pomade to keep my curls intact and I still had build up and now nothing so definitely recommend and will keep on using it. Now if you could design ones with nicer colors and maybe a way to add a wide tooth comb together with it .. This little rubber thing scratches my scalp and gets my dandruff shampoo right in there. As a result it increases the effectiveness of whatever that active ingredient is, and it feels super good while it does so. It seems sturdy and durable, made of quality material, but given the price I would buy it again, even if it doesn’t last more than a month or two. I've tried using different scalp massagers & shampoo brushes before, without success.  Most would catch my hair so I couldn't get a good massaging action, and/or (depending on the type of plastic, flexible or hard) the bristles would bend or feel too sharp.  I tried another with fat, round ""fingers"" made of hard  plastic which didn't have enough grip to do more than slide over/under my hair.  I really like this brush so far, though I've only used it twice.  I was able to really get to my scalp with it and use it in every direction, with care-- mostly doing a kind of double-swipe over one area at a time, changing direction as I worked around my head.  I did try a circular scrubbing action just to see what would happen and didn't get tangled at all, but my hair is short & layered (6 inches at its longest), and in good condition (natural texture is smooth, wavy and somewhat coarse). So I can't say how this would work for someone with really long, thick, fine, or dry hair, etc. but I think you'd just need to be careful, and this brush would still a better choice than the others described.  I like the way it conforms to my hand and to my head, and the short bristles are just the right size & shape to do what they're supposed to do.  They feel good & firm, not hard & scratchy. Well i bought this brush because i have scalp eczema and wanted to loosen/ scrap off the dead skin flakes on my scalp. Unfortunately i have really thick hair and was not able to get the brush to touch my scalp without quite a bit of effort involved. I ended up going with a different type of scalp brush. My husband however said it reached his scalp and felt great (he has shoulder length hair). So this brush might not work for thick hair but it definitely works for thinner hair These are good.Because they are rubber you can be a little more aggressive with them when massaging your shampoo scalp which is quite an invigorating feeling.The tips are actually not rounded off which I think I may prefer. The tips are actually cut to be flat. Take a closer look at the pics. The problem is that after buying two, I can easily see that they are not all made precisely the same. One has edges that are not smoothed out and a little sharper which is annoying, while the other is a bit more manageable and less painful. I wish they made these with better quality because the idea is great but every tip on the bottom is different and some not smoothed out to avoid scraping. Again, I wonder if the bottoms were rounded off rather than cut to be flat, if it would have been better.....yes, yes indeed it would have been better.A good purchase but don't expect them all to be the same.",5,3,2

I figured I would use a paintbrush and dye my grey roots, while leaving the length orange and brown. The bottle came well sealed but the label was covering the instructions. I used a brand new paintbrush and just dipped it in, applying liberally.No stranger to messy dye, I used gloves and kept my work area tidy. Even so, when I rinsed the paintbrushes off, any tiny bit of contact with the countertop resulted in permanent stains, even when I tried to wipe it away immediately. Tried borax and super washing soda combined with lemon juice. No luck. Tried scrubbing bubbles. Nada. Tried hydrogen peroxide. Also no. Manufacturer's web site has some recommendations such as Magic Eraser and/or acetone but we have neither of those. Before you start, test your workspace in a non-visible area and make sure you have a good cleaning solution for it before you start.Even so, I was very tidy. I even managed to keep the dye off of my scalp in most spots, except towards my temples where the hair is very fine. I have very thick hair and figured I'd test a top layer before bothering with lower layers. But I also did apply it fairly thickly on top. It looked great during application. I let it sit for four hours (after running strand tests and finding the white hair to be fairly stubborn if less than 4 hours). When I rinsed the initial dye out, this is what it looked like right away, while still wet. Basically, pink scalp with still white strands.To be fair, I didn't bleach it. I have knee-length hair and am not about to risk that kind of damage. Henna is far more effective and doesn't need to be bleached. You can see some orange henna strands toward the back from months ago. I usually use a tiny amount of acid with henna, such as vinegar or lemon juice, to help the dye absorb. I may try a mix of that on a strand test to see if there's a ratio that wouldn't cause harm.I don't want to give up on Manic Panic but it's ineffective so far and damaging to bathroom surfaces. That said, it smells neutral, which is a lot better than henna. It's also nice that it's premixed and not as much of a royal mess, though at least henna doesn't permanently stain countertops/tubs.I had been hoping to go for buying purple, red, and blue to give a subtle flame-like hue on my grey roots, over the course of a couple of years. But this just isn't really working out so far. I'll probably keep trying and will update the review if I have any success.Update (about a week later):I did another round and am going to increase the star rating. This time, the dye absorbed really well! I did two things differently: I shampooed my roots a day ahead of time and I used about twice as much dye. I also used petroleum jelly on my scalp line, as others recommended. That helped for not having a pink face but I found it didn't really work on the top of my head, as it just meant that the roots became immune to dye, lol. Basically, for my hair, if it's too conditioned/coated, the dye won't absorb. If it's dry, it bonds better. I have almost ankle-length hair, so I usually keep my hair pretty oiled and conditioned to avoid snarls. I do not bleach, ever, as that runs too much risk of breakage/harm.I do love how conditioned my hair feels after using this dye. I've upgraded from 2 stars to 5 stars. I'd probably knock it a half star for the way it dyes the countertop and tub, if I could take away half a star. I'm not sure how well it will hold up with time and may update the review later. I will note that the dye didn't stain the tub if it was diluted, such as during showering, but I also only used this on my roots (I use henna on the length) so volume may be part of why it went okay. My fingernails got badly stained - even though I used gloves, this stuff is strangely itchy for me so scratching it the first day led to messy pink fingernails. Not a big deal though. I ended up buying another color too, as the second round went so much better than the first round. Shipping time was great for this product. I usually use Pinky Colors, but they couldn't ship next day. So I went with this Maniac Panic Hot Hot Pink that could ship next day and I like it a lot. Manic Panic Vampire Red Color Cream 2 Pack Classic High Voltage:I used this product for a mermaid costume (I hate wigs), and I am super happy with the results. Honestly, if work would allow me to keep this color I absolutely would. HOWEVER I super did not expect it to show up as vividly as it did on my light-medium brown hair. (Picture attached)My hair was color treated (apprx 2 months ago) with a dark natural red-ish/brown color & highlights. I expected the highlights to be bright, but this stuff showed up allover. I did not pretreat my hair in any way. Washed well with normal dove shampoo the night before (apprx 24 hrs) & did not condition.The person helping me had never used hair-dye before. That’s how simple this stuff is. I used vaseline around my hairline & on my ears to keep from dying my skin which was a good call. We poured 1 tub of the dye into a bowl & they used their hand (with a glove) to apply it all over my hair. It took quite some time to apply (maybe 45 min) due to users having no clue what we were doing, and I left it on for around 45 minutes after finishing.The consistency is great so there wasn’t any unwanted dye mess in the bathroom. I cut open a trash bag & used it around my shoulders to try to reduce mess as well. Recommend one for the floor & other surfaces just in case. I have VERY long hair, and one tub was enough. I’m glad I got the two-pack just incase, but I only needed one.I rinsed with cold water & sulfate free shampoo/conditioner. The water never “ran clear” despite rinsing for a long time so I eventually gave up. I let it air dry & slept with it in a top-knot to finish drying. I slept on a towel which was a good idea. First red picture is after taking it down the next day. No heat. No styling. No products. The color is stunning & I’m obsessed. Again though: it is WAY brighter than everything I read (reviews included) made me think it would be.I washed it last night & was honestly trying to get a good bit of the color out - to no avail. I shampooed twice/conditioned once with sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner & used hot water. After about 30 minutes in the shower the water finally seemed to run *mostly* clear, but it was not as clear as I prefer. I shower at night before bed & only towel dry so it is still pretty damp when I lie down. Again slept on a towel & this was just as important ad after it was first dyed. TONS of transfer overnight. Last picture is today after it has finally air-dryed completely. My hair still feels soft & healthy after dying. I notice all my baby hairs going wild a ton more, but that is always the case after dye.My only complaint about the product is the color transfer after washing when wet. I can’t really speak to when it is dry, but I don’t believe I had issues with it being down against my white shirt when it was dry (but I imagine rain/sweat would be a problem). I almost never blow-dry my hair so if I were able to keep this color long-term the transfer would be an issue for me.Will update as necessary. I am trying to get the color out asap & will wash with regular shampoo/conditioner & hot water plus whatever else I can think of. Sorry, employers. Not thrilled about having to wash daily until it fades & honestly a little worried the faded colors will be more offensive to the employers than the dark red.Fyi: The review asks me to rate “drying power,” and I honestly have no clue what that is. So I’m 5 starring that one for benefit of doubt. When my kids want color these manic panic colors a the best and easy to touch up!",5,2,3

Soft but dependable hold Great product delivery was fast I love the smell and you only need to use a small amount. It helps to get the frizz off the edges and create softness as wellA must have! This is my second time ordering this. My hair is really long and i use it after i get out of the shower. It makes my hair super soft. This stuff is magic.Seriously, it is the best hair-product I have ever used and I do not care how expensive it is, I will use nothing else as long as this exists. The product goes on smooth and leaves your hair firmly in place all day long with a very light shine to it. However, even though your hair won't move it still feels soft and pliable to the touch unlike traditional gels and pomades. I haven't ever noticed any type of fragrant smell which I'm happy about and just a little quarter sized amount will keep me set for a full day. Because I need so little this bottle lasts me months, so the price is absolutely worth it.Pros:- Solid hold- Mild shine- Hair is still soft to the touch- 24 hour hold- Hair doesn't feel greasy- A little dab will do you- My girlfriend is still willing to run her fingers through my hair (doesn't like pomades or gels)Cons:- Cost",5,5,0

comfortable not noisy nice cleaned easy price good bought others twice price half good happy,"Conair 1875 Watt Turbo Hair Dryer, Blue/Black","I enjoy the conair brand hair dryers. Has good heat and blow power. Would recommend!  I originally had the INFINITIPRO (rainbow) one and i LOVED IT.  I bought it for around $60 at Ulta or one of those stores.  It lasted me about a year and then the cover/filter thing broke off and it scared me to use it because it would catch your hair and it smelled like something was burning.I decided to get this one because, hello, I'm a woman lol I NEED a hair dryer.  This was $20, not sure about the release date, it's not as pretty as my rainbow one but I love blue so that's okay.1- There is NO way this is 1875 watts.  My rainbow was WAY more powerful and it was 1875 watts!2- The wire is shorter than the rainbow one.  To be fair I was always complaining about the rainbow one being too long so I'll probably just have to get used to it.So I guess we'll see.  Even if this lasts a year I would be happy since the rainbow one was 3 times as much money!I'll update in a few months! I go through blow dryers like crazy. I'm an artist that does Dutch Pour. With this technique you thin your paints, pour it on your canvas and move it around and spread it using a blow dryer. It's messy and the dryer tends to get covered with paint. For this reason I need an inexpensive one with the power to do the job. The Conair 1875 fits my needs perfectly! I know this might not exactly be the type of review you were looking for but it's what I got! This was purchased to replace a Conair Ion black blow dryer that lasted many years. It has 2 drawbacks: one is that it’s longer and not as compact which makes it more awkward to use. Second is the configuration of the switches cause the blow dryer to shut off when in use. Pluses are: Nice blue color, enough power for my hair, and it’s lightweight. Appreciate the design of this hair dryer because without any attachments, it focuses air where I point.  Lots of oomph so it dries hair quickly.  Own 2 of these, 1 in each bathroom so available for guests. I bought this dryer because my Helen of Troy blow dryer is not blowing hot air anymore. It’s been years of having it. I wanted something super affordable but that worked just as well. This dryer heats well and dries my hair quickly. I also wanted to try using the diffuser. I’ve never used it. But I’ll have a chance to try on my kinky curly 4C hair type. I highly recommend this hair dryer. drying power is good, light weight but a little big to carry for traveling.",3,4,-1

like the results I religiously use this stuff after every wash, and I can really feel the difference on the days that I don't have access to it. It smells fantastic, makes my hair silky and full, and keeps it growing healthy. I spray it 4-6 times on damp hair, use my hands to distribute it to the ends a bit, then blowdry.I used to have frizzy, unhealthy, hard to manage hair; the kind of hair that hairdressers look at in disgust and immediately ask ""do you condition your hair? You need a DEEEEP conditioner"". I've never been able to grow my hair out more than an inch before it starts getting awful split ends, and the back of my hair has always felt rough and looked dead. I started using Aussie Hair Insurance 4 years ago and after 2 weeks I already felt a difference. After a year my hair was growing out healthy and felt soft to the touch and it would blow-dry straight and full without using a round brush. Now 4 years later I have hairdressers telling me my hair feels SO SOFT and looks so healthy and I've had older ladies compliment me on how beautiful my hair is. The old ladies could just be envying my 24 years of life, but I'd like to give credit to this miracle of a hair product because my hair really isn't that great naturally. I don't know where I'd be without this stuff, honestly. I haven't found a single leave-in conditioner that works even close to as well as this.I just wish it was easier to find! I've only been able to find it at Bed Bath & Beyonds that have a drugstore section and Stater Bros. Target, Ralphs, and other markets carry a product called Hair Insurance but it's a heat protector, not a leave-in conditioner. And so I have to buy in bulk from Amazon when the Stater Bros runs out :( I have very, very thick and long (to my waist) hair so I always need extra moisture to combat both dryness and split ends.  This product meets this need and more wonderfully well.  Plus it has the additional bonus of having the great Aussie product smell, which is typical and expected from this company.  I do not wash my hair every day but usually only wash every three or four day but this conditioner does not build up on my hair nor does it leave a residue.  The sprayer disperses the right amount and does not clog.  This conditioner is also great for fly-aways and frizzies.  Hair does not become sticky, gooey, or stiff.  If I overshoot my hair and some lands on my back, shoulders, face, or arms, I just rub it in.  The spray does not feel yucky or greasy on the skin.  I also use the leave-in conditioner as a detangler for my hair since I often have snarls and knots.  I cannot oversell how wonderful this stuff is.  I always keep a back up bottle so I do not run out.  I whole heartedly recommend this multi use product to anyone who cares about their hair. It's been extremely difficult to find a leave-in conditioner that performs as well as the defunct Aveeno product. I'm certain that many Aveeno users were surprised and disappointed when the leave-in conditioner was no longer available. Though, Aveeno (Johnson & Johnson) is infamous for replacing successful products with ""new"" versions that have more additives (Aloe, Vitamin E, etc.) I would have given Aussie Hear Insurance Leave-in Conditioner 5 Stars, if its consistency was cream-like. Current liquid consistency is a challenge to apply by spraying directly on the back of one's head. A thicker consistency would facilitate application by hand. All that said, this product ranks 4 Stars and is highly recommended. I'm so glad brands like Aussie exist - affordable, pleasant to use, and EFFECTIVE.About my hair : mermaid-length, straight to wavy, ""fluffy"" texture, thickI'm already a fan of Aussie's 3-minute conditioners, and this is no exception. The scent is faintly tropical but light and pleasant. It untangles hair extremely well, even in spots that my regular conditioner can't help. It hasn't caused any product build-up in my two months of using it, even after certain days of me spritzing liberal amounts when I use my blow dryer/curling iron. Usually my hair gets a little angry with me after -multiple days of heat styling in a row, but this leave-in conditioner is doing its job well.When I ordered this based off of good reviews alone, I actually had no idea that I would be getting *three* leave-in conditioners. Needless to say,  I was very pleasantly surprised :) Before this product, I was using Redkin's Allsoft Leave-in Conditioner, which is a lot more $$$. This works just as well, if not better. I think I found my new favorite with Aussie. Since using this, I need nothing else for natural curls. I use a small plastic bottle (the .97 bottles that walmart sells in the 'travel size' bins work for me.) to mix 1/3 water to 2/3 conditioner. This gives a good mix for morning for waking up dead head curls. The bottle I use gives more spray per squirt so I'm able to really wet my hair, as needed, and don't get hand cramps from using the conditioner's pump spray.I use the condition 'straight' for rainy or damp days to battle frizz. Even if I get caught in  the rain, the conditioner will help hair dry without frizzing. The conditioner's bottle pump is a little stiff and if you've got a lot of hair, you may want to get another plastic bottle to use it straight, to avoid hand cramps. I don't; but, for arthritis sufferers, it may be necessary.I also use it 'straight' as hair spray for 'setting' a style. It doesn't make hair stiff, but does hold the curls and hair will feel soft to the touch.Also, getting this via Subscribe and Save saves money as well as assuring I won't run out.",5,5,0

The number of rods is perfect and the clips.Be careful because these will burn your finger tips due to the level of heat and no real surface area to grab them.  The clips that come with the set are slick and want to slip.  Took me several uses to figure out how to get them to hold.  In the meantime I ordered more clips just in case.My hair looks great but my fingers tips are not happy about it. I’ve just purchased these for the first time ever. I have super straight, thick hair and have always wanted curls. As a teen I always used a curling iron but it was never enough to really hold a curl. My hair is just too heavy, but with these curlers I’m finding that it holds so much better. There is a bit of a learning curve, and I’m learning that I need to use product (mousse when it’s damp, and then hair spray on dry hair before and after rolling) but it’s really holding well. I’ve used them a few times so far and I’m getting better at it lol. This product really met my expectations and I’m very pleased with this purchase. There are 20 rollers of assorted diameter in this set. Rollers are coated with a soft, tangle-free material and the ends of the rollers are constructed of a ""stay cool"" material that minimizes burned fingers. The set heats up quickly. There are 20 butterfly-style roller clips and the clips can be warmed on the three heating rails. This is a nice feature that helps ensure more curls. You'll need a system for heating and using the clips, though, as you can heat only three clips simultaneously. Easier and faster than curling your entire head of hair with a curling iron. Excellent product!  Heats rapidly, sustains curls and most importantly “does not damage the hair!”  Great addition to the home care beauty arsenal! Why mess with perfection.  The set I had in the 80s was perfect.  These are about a 7/10. These are not as hot as I'd like and the clamps are a miss. I love the fact that the clips are heated, but they do not stay headed long. Also, I wish the clips came in different sizes to accommodate the different size rollers.... Only reason it gets one it’s cause for me it doesn’t work great ? Maybe I’m using it wrong but I didn’t like them Clips get too hot to place easily. A bit cumbersome to use.",1,4,-3

It's easy to use, offers a strong hold and natural matte finish, and doesn't leave any residue or flakes behind. Highly recommended! Awesome product! I've been using it since I was in high school. It takes less than 5 minutes to get my hair ready when I go out. I purchased this ""Wildshake"" (purple tin) and the ""Air Rise"" (green tin) after doing several hours worth of research on finding the best possible pomade for men with fine, short/medium hair. I can confirm that this is the best styling pomade for men with shorter hair (regardless of whether it is fine, super fine, medium, or thicker hair) -- if, like me, you have more complex medium-ish-short hair that needs some pomade before getting the suit on and going to work, but you have fine/wavy or fine/straight hair, then this works great but the Gatsby Air Rise (green tin) works way better because it doesn't weigh down the hair at all. This one is a little bit heavier which works well when I get my hair cut shorter, however, will still work on medium length hair if you have really thick or tangly hair that you need to make behave. For me personally, I have a ton of hair, but it's all Spanish hair - fine, silky and not super volume-rich after putting most pomades into it (because most of them weigh the hair down and flatten it). Anyway, if you're anything like me, the air rise is the way to go, but if you have really short hair then I'd go with this. It's probably good to own both. For some background, I'd tried all the Crew products (meh) before, then ventured out to try to find something more specific to the needs of my hair that maybe didn't have a ton of insane chemicals in it either. If you are skeptical of synthetic chemicals, I was surprised to discover the hard way that Paul Mitchell products are full of them. These are surprisingly clean though, as far as these things go, perhaps because it is made in Japan (they may have more strict standards). I'm sad that I can't find this brand at salons here in the states but I have been very happy to find them so inexpensively on Amazon. I would recommend this brand to anyone, just make sure you look at their chart of different products and choose the one with the correct texture for you and the one which is best for your hair type and length. Since discovering Gatsby's constellation of waxes, I haven't looked back. I've now tried Wild Shake, I have now used 3 of their hair wax products and they are all excellent.  This one is my favorite for when my hair which is usually cut short starts to grow and has weight to it.  I really like the feel of this and the way it works on my longer hair days.  I have also used it on short hair and I also like it as well.  It does have a different hold feel to the hair and it does what it says it will do.  It actually works to give you that grunge look or messy look.  Like the rest of their waxes, it takes very little to use and the styling holds very well,  Restyling is easy and requires no new use of product.  All you have to do is move the hair where you want it.  If someone where to ask me if I had to choose between this one or the Spiky Edge, it would be difficult to decide since I really like them both and they are designed to be used for certain hair lengths.  I do not know about the rest of you, but my hair length noticeably changes after about 2 weeks and I need to cut my hair every 3-4 weeks.  Yes, I keep my hair short to medium in length, more of the atheletic look.  So, I like both products because they do what they are suppose to for the length they were designed for.  If push came to shove, I would say, I choose the Spiky Edge for really short hair (like a flat top or military look) and I choose the Wild Shake for hair that is noticeably longer.  So I need both since I have 2 different lengths between hair cuts.",1,5,-4

It's not the exact same unit. A bit noisy and less air. The problem we had was trying to push the button to get the cord to retract. After a few days of fooling around we found if you push a little on the button and pull the cord it retracts QUICKLY.  I'd say it's a bit bulky for travel. 2nd one of these dryers I owned. Best thing about this dryer is it blows hot air without burning your hair! Most hairdryers today barely blow slightly warm air at best which won't ""set"" your style. I'd purchase several dryers in big box stores & returned all of them. Ordered this one & wish I'd have thought of it sooner & hope they never quit producing them.  As someone with curly hair I bought this during the winter to diffuse my hair so my hair wouldn't be soaked, it has so much power and I love how the cord can go back into the dryer after use. I did notice it was a customer return box was opened stuff not packed properly plus was not impressed that they sent it in the retail box showing the whole world what I am buying an open box . It should have been in an amazon  box. but I am not going to short them on stars because it does work well This is more of a styling dryer, not a standard dry and go dryer. I love the retractor. I've had a couple of this same hairdryer.  I love the retractable cord. Great product. I love the retractable cord feature!",3,3,0

Permanent Hair Color, LB01 Extra Light Ash Blonde, Pack of 1, Hair Dye","I have naturally medium brown hair, I been going too my hair stylist for years to be a light blonde! Hundreds of dollars down the drain....I'm a single mom and love being blonde but couldn't no longer afford paying for salon visits. I then thought to save money and start to do my own hair at home! Which I never did my own hair before, but I read many things about going blonde at home. I didn't want to put just BLEACH on my hair. Lol I knew I would just melt my hair off. 😅 I purchased 2 boxes of the extra light natural blonde dye. Left on my root area for 30 minutes.....and put a plastic cap on for heat, I then put on the rest of my hair and ends 15 minutes. So yes total of 45 minutes without any burning of my scalp.  I washed out- with only the conditioner it came with and left on a few minutes. My hair turned pale light yellow 💛 which is normal cause it's bleach in the dye. I put on my hair after it dried....Wella toner T18 lightest ash blonde! It looks so light and gorgeous. No one believed I didn't go to a salon and have it done!!! I love it! Looks so pretty and I saved so much money doing this on my own! I highly recommend this hair dye! It's so gentle and conditioning on my hair. I'm gonna stock up on this dye for now on! Hope this review helps. Been using this for nearly 20 years. I use it about every 5-7 weeks. The color is nearly identical to my natural color, but I have some gray (more like white🥴) hair coming thru in places so this helps keep it all blended and looking refreshed.  My hair is in the dryer side, so most times I just use it as root touch up, and right before rising it out I apply conditioner to the ends so that the dryer ends don’t absorb any of the product. This has helped tremendously to keep my ends/tips from becoming dry/damaged during the process.  I do a whole head application every 5 or 6 months.  The smell is strong, but definitely tolerable. I run a small fan on the bathroom counter as I apply which helps dissipate it in the air. Overall, it’s super hard to beat, ESPECIALLY at around a $10 price point.  👍🏻💁🏼‍♀️ Was worried when I got it and the box said new improved scent because I am allergic to most perfumes/fragrances.When nice n easy 'improved' their scent it was awful and I switched to Loreal.  So I was very concerned that they had made a similar change.  Luckily they hadn't. it is not a flowery sent at all.  It's a really subtle kind of rich herbal with a ... I want to say a bit of musk maybe(?), but not really a strong scent and it didn't bother my perfume allergy at all.  Very happy with the color too! UPDATE 3/7/23: At the end of January I did a bleach bath to get everything to a level 10, and another round of this same dye. Its been over a month now and the color still looks fantastic, I have to touch up my roots soon! I will continue to buy this productI LOVED this dye!! I’ve been dying and cutting my own hair for a few years now, and I recently decided to go blonde. I received the 9A dye today with same day shipping, and immediately got to work after doing another round of bleach on my roots and Olaplex 3 after. I also applied it to my brows. It turned out beautiful! Will update if anything changes in the coming weeks.My hair was wet in the before pics; When dry it’s usually a mix of level 7 inside near my roots, 8 and 9 on my mids, and some of the highlights are a level 10. I was using the Ferria ice blonde toner before, which was good but is meant for LEVEL 10 HAIR and did not cover the darker parts at all. I decided I need something stronger and went with a permanent dye to really cancel out that hideous brassy yellow I always get after lightening (I have level 2 hispanic hair naturally).This product worked WONDERS! I left it on longer than the directions say to and of course some parts of my hair processed a tad more than others. This is more my own fault and not that of the product; I had pink money pieces before going blonde and those poor strands have gotten bleached like 10 times, so they took this dye more than the rest of my hair. I like this look though and im sure it will even out as I wash my hair! Smell is tolerable and I intend to keep using this as my roots grow out. I used to color my own hair for years and started going to a salon about ten yrs ago. Decided to try it once more before booking an appt, usually not happy w color and costs hundreds. Colored my hair tonight and I'll never go back to the salon again for bleach blonde hair. Will be sticking with my LB 02 forever. I love this product and wouldn't use any other.  Have used for 50 years now!What I was disappointed in was the shipment of the item. It was in a brown bag shooved into my mailbox.  I'm getting a replacement, but just a lot of trouble having to go through the proccess of returning.  Should have at least been put in a box for shipment. I needed to cover my roots till my next appt. Thought if it worked well enough I would just stick to doing the box. Think I’d rather still go spend salon money ti get the icy blonde I love. This is pretty but made my hair purple blue for about a week. This is a week in w washing it a few times and it’s better now. I have my next appt on the 13th. Think I’ll still keep it to add the icy blind highlight Love color, yet the smell bought tears to my eyes. This is the perfect color for me. It's a silver with faint brown highlights on my hair. I'm 66 years old and wanted to transition to silver hair without having silver roots and brown ends. Now my hair is one color and looks great. Wish the smell wasn't so bad.",1,2,-1

My hair feels great and looking better everyday I always research products a thousand times over before I buy them! There are many organic, stimulating-claiming shampoos out there so I was very careful as to which one I wanted to purchase. I bought this shampoo online at amazon because the price is worth it & it TRULY does do what it says! I have a very, dry, somewhat itchy BUT oily scalp! This is a great clarifying scalp shampoo as well as an AMAZING scalp stimulator! If any of you are wondering about hair growth, this shampoo is for you! I have only been using it for a month now, and my hair grows very slow! I just got about 4 inches (of split ends) chopped a month ago and my hair has already grown 1/2 an inch this month! I use it every other day and use the emu oil conditioner. By the way ladies, hair growth DOES mostly have to do with genetics it also has to do with daily trims & moisture, regardless if your hair is VERY oily or not! I recommend this shampoo for anyone with dry, stubborn hair! It will remove any dead skin cells blocking hair follicles in pores and open up those stubborn pores! & When pores open up, your blood vessels (inside the pores) are given oxygen, which further stimulates the hair to finally GROW! I just wish there was a bigger bottle. I just found out that you may also purchase this shampoo at Sally's! I've used now almost the whole bottle, but there was no change so far noticeable. But at least there were no side-effects and the shampoo is quite thick and creamy and has a nice smell and lasts quite for a while, but I think I won't buy again. Like how it adds volume and promotes hair growth Excellent shampoo!! Great shampoo!!!!! My scalp felt so clean after I washed it. I've been natural for almost 6 years now and I'm always looking for products that clean all the oil and dirt from my scalp. Great smell too I highly recommend. I love this shampoo! I have very fine straight hair, and it's about 3 inches past my shoulders. My hair tends to look oily within 24 hours. I've tried many volume shampoos, organic shampoo, dry shampoo etc. This shampoo blows me away! It's amazing, and I don't use conditioner after either. My hair looks like I've been at a hair salon every time I wash it. I'm excited to try more products this brand has to offer!",1,5,-4

It's my absolute favorite dandruff shampoo and it has saved my scalp and hair so many times. It has also done the same for my family who had issues with flaking and seb derm on the scalp. I had very bad seb derm and this cleared it so fast- I felt and saw a massive change after one use. Same for my family who also had things clear up after only one use. As soon as I feel a slight itch on my head, I wash with it. I always have it stocked in my bathroom with at least 3 bottles on hand. Head and Shoulders and so many other dandruff shampoos I have tried just do not compare to this at all, those are like level 3 dandruff shampoos and this is level 10 perfection. Smell is fresh, not medical.  Thick and works up a lather. Using it every other day with good results I have to admit to not reading description as I replaced a 'retail' bottle with an Amazon purchase only to find that the product was half the size of the original - I thought it was a good deal, but you get what you pay for - that being said the product is my 'go to' solution for itchy scalp from eczema - halfsized or not - thumbs up. The zinc in product works good on my scalp, especially if you let it sit on your scalp for a few minutes before rinsing off. It helps relieve my itchy scalp. It worked well enough I made a second order. He probado muchos productos contra la dermatitis seborreica y este es el mejor I bought this to treat my scalp condition where had multiple painful pus-filled pimples on my scalp.  They were all over but were heavier on the back of my head.  I use it every time I wash my hair and let it soak in for 2-3 minutes.  I then rinse and rewash my hair with Dove Dermacare soap to get the smell out.  The smell really is not that bad, but I prefer to quickly rewash may hair.  It took 4-6 weeks to get the full effect but the condition slowly and continuously improved and now I have almost zero pimples.My condition usually got worse after my hair was clipped.  The reason I tried this shampoo was the result of some research on dermatology sites.  I don't really know exactly what condition I had, but this made it go away completely. Like that it foams up like regular shampooLike the thicknessDon’t like the price",3,5,-2

I hope they work for him. I've been using these scissors for over 10 years. The blades are still sharp enough to cut my thick and course Asian hair. Good size for hair cutting I can't say enough good things about these shears. I purchased these in June, and 4 months later the blades are still ultra-sharp and the tension hasn't budged. I trim my bangs with these every week, and do an all-over trim about once a month. I will never buy no-name hair scissors again. Good scissors for everyday hair, eyebrow and sideburns touchups. No overly sharp as described but adequate. Work better when hair is damp. Size, value, and function make this hair cutting shear the best addition your grooming kit. Just the right size for my wife's hands These are great budget shears for people who like to trim their own bangs or freshen up layers. They're very sharp, glide along the hair well for edged layers, and don't catch on thicker and textured hair (a problem for a lot of cheaper shears). They fit comfortably on my fingers as well which means less cramping when I'm pulling off awkward angles to get harder to reach sections of my hair. Works great on wet or dry hair!FWIW, I use this on my own curly hair to keep it looking fresh between my usual professional cuts. I do point cutting to break up and thin out my ends a bit when they get bulky and re-shape my layers as well as just snipping out any rough ends when they occur. Nothing too fancy, but that being the case I don't need $100 shears and these more than meet my needs.",1,2,-1

I love it even more than Thick and since you only need a few spritzes to style your hair think it will last a while making it a great value. I have very fine hair, and Yes.

light blond shade. I am pretty white.I’m looking for chemical free hair products due to hair loss and allergies.There was no hair loss or itching scalp after. It’s not like the hairdressers but I’ve done it once so far and it did look great.I haven’t washed it yet.So not sure how much fading will occur but I did rinse it with water and a tiny bit of natural conditioner and it seemed to take out some of the color. I pretty much love the results of Surya Henna. I have used various brands in the past, and have done a healthy amount of research on henna, botanical hair coloring, safety, etc...I bleach my hair in the summer, when I get bored I henna. My natural color is nearly black (but truly just dark brown), so I started with about a years worth of highlights with dark roots.  I purchased Natural Mountain Henna in Burgundy and layered henna on damp hair, since my hair was damp I don't think I got much in the way of concentration, but it did deepen my highlights to a dark blonde, with heavy ash (green tones)...clearly the indigo which did become muted once the henna oxidized. I knew that I wanted to go darker, but didn't want to repeat with the same brand so I stepped out on a limb and tried Surya. Great results!! I feel like I have a  great fall color and am even considering using the RED, after reading another review.  I waited about a week before I felt like I wanted to commit...and then ordered Surya.The color swatches on the side of the box match the results (exactly) on my hair....1) This is not pure henna, it does have some chemicals and FDA colors, on EWG when I checked this rated at a 4 for toxicity on a scale of 1 to 10 - Keeping in mind that food coloring, etc.. that we eat would likely rate higher (though I wouldn't eat this)2) This is semi-permanent, which tells me that it will fade and I am okay with that because the stuff is luxurious out of the box.3) It is packed with really great ingredients that make you feel good about using it and my hair after using it felt very soft and was wicked shiny.Overall the color is really fabulous - if they could find a way to remove all chemicals that in my mind would be significantly better and hence I deducted a star. I am definitely going to order this again.Update: As most have said the color did fade within a month or so, but certainly not back to the bleached blond hair I had.I've added a photo which shows about two days oxidation. I intentionally left the front section blond with neutral henna only coating that section.I'm likely going to try some other brands because of a few of the chemicals. 2nd update: because i was doing streaks i was thrilled that the maker suggested unscrewing the bottle cap rather than snipping it with scissors. so, my first round of streaks was in late may (i'm writing this 7nov17) and the color was amazing (see my initial notes below). by august a friend called those grown-out and faded streaks ""pink"" when we were standing outside on a cloudy day, which didn't please me much. so, in september i re-did the streaks, trying to go over the top of my initial streaks. this was using the same bottle that i'd opened in may and resealed. THIS TIME the color on my hair is an odd brown with maybe a hint of that wonderful purple-y burgandy that i love but really just brown or maybe dark auburn. not what i want! my conclusion is that my saved henna cream has changed in the bottle that i opened months ago. i'm going to order a new bottle and will come back here to post results!UPDATE: just in case your hair is like mine, semi-permanent might be permanent! i've had semi-p do this previously so i wasn't shocked. unfortunately when this is super faded (almost 4 months later) it's not very attractive. my choice is keep it fresh or let it grow out. a heads up!---i used this for streaks not all over so can't address whether it conditions or not but it didn't seem to diminish the softness or shine of my hair at all. covers grey brilliantly and seems at least approximately the same burgundy shade on my medium brown hair as on the grey.this has faded a little in something like 6 - 8 washes but that's as advertised.the color when fresh is exactly what i wanted...that burgundy that's a little purple and a little bright without being garish. the faded color is nice too. semi-permanent hair color behaves as permanent on my hair and this is doing the same though it's perhaps fading just a little faster...semi-permanent just dulls a little on my hair without ever going away. on my light blonde hair  i tried it on a small part of my hair to see results , what i thought ! my hair turned to  warm blond , a little brassy , Thank God , i tried on a small part not whole head . Like how easy it is to use These semi-perm colors are so easy to apply. Just protect your skin with some vaseline (edge of face) and rub in the dye with glives. I use the plastic hood from the box, then double up with a shower cap and sleep with the dye in my hair overnight (cover pillowcase w a brown toned hand towel.) Wash off in the morning (no conditioner for the 1st wash...fine thereafter). Dye fades evenly so there isn't that artificial line of demarcation between roots and rest of my hair, over time. It's not permanent dye so needs to be applied more frequently. Burgundy suits me better (gray at top of head to dark brown Asian hair farther down) than Mahoganey. Mahogany looks yellow on my hair, and makes it look like a bad blond job.",4,3,1

It acts like a perm.  Even had the same type of ammonia smell, but only after it was applied to the hair.  In the bottle it just smells like a light fragrance.  And it definitely wasn't very moisturizing, kind of dried the hair out.  Weird...  Also the bottle was NOT sealed, so I don't know.  I didn't use this with any other product, I just used it after shampooing almost as a conditioner.  Maybe I used it wrong, but it definitely felt like I needed to deep condition after using this.  smh  And it took four months for hair to revert back to normal.  I use other Aphogee products like the Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizor which I love, but this was just confusing. It does everything that it says,  great moisturizer and leaves your hair very soft Arrive on time. Great price for the size. I can’t find this in the stores so it was good that Amazon had it. The scent isn’t bad. I would buy again after I use all of this one. Also, I use it with the shampoo, step one protein treatment and the leave in conditioner.  I see a huge difference. No more shedding or breakage! Just be careful with the step one treatment because it smells horrible, is sticky and can sting  if you’ve recently done you relaxer (nothing serious for me though).

Since I've been using it, my hair has become much more healthy, thick and strong. Great pricing for a damage control for hair. Order when you need it! I use this product when I am doing a protein wash (I alternate between Moisture and protein), and I like it doesn't strip my hair and its still soft after washing. First purchase in 2014 and to this day 2022 I still repurchase.  Can't attest to how much it has helped on its own but it hasn't hurt hence 4 stars. I follow with the ApHogee Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor and their leave in. Oh I only shampoo once (My Hair is 4z yes not 4c, zzz and is on the dry side I give a good rinse and massage with just water then I shampoo 1x taking my time) My wife's hair was getting brittle and this was recommended to us. Restored the shine and flex fairly well. She's happy and that's what counts. I used this right after I bleached and dyed my curly hair and followed up with the two step protein treatment. Completely revived my hair like nothing had happened 10/10. If your wondering about the scent, it’s more of a fruity scent. This product does what it claims. It does strengthen and repair damaged strands. Great for relaxed and/or color treated hair. I use this product once a week and follow up with a deep conditioning and moisturizing mask and get excellent results. I wash my hair about 3 times a week, but don't use this shampoo every time I wash my hair because it has keratin protein in it. Too much protein isn't good for hair, so once a week works for my hair. I use a quality moisturizing shampoo like Shea Moisture or Silk Elements or Ion in between. I do notice stronger hair and easier styling.  You always have to follow up with a good moisturizing conditioner and a good leave in conditioner that detangles hair. Will continue to use this shampoo in my weekly regimen. Scent, not so much. But softness and moisturizing,  yesss. Love the scent the texture it leaves your hair.",1,5,-4

Definitely adds some shine, but tends to make my hair seem greasy if I spray enough to get the shine I want. If I use it sparingly enough to avoid the greasiness then I don't get much shine. Although I generally like TRESemme products, I much prefer the I live in GA so you can imagine how frizzy hair can get in the humidity.  This spray helps a lot!  I have a drawer full of anti-frizz products but this one seems to the best job.  I gave it 4 stars because I haven't yet found perfection in the anti-frizz department but I am very happy with this product. Great product that I have used for years and cannot find at Target.  HOWEVER, this product always comes late and has leaked in the box.  Every. Single. Time.  I'm not picky when it comes to these things, but they could really work on improving their shipping. I wanted something like this - hold style without heavy oily look and feel and without crunchy hairspray.  I wish that it held style a little better - I find myself using some on damp hair, then more after hair is dry, but for the price, that's okay.  It doesn't prevent static, which is what I had hoped. This product met my expectations but I dont think I would personally purchase it again, It does have a slight drying affect on the hair which is not something that works for me, but as for adding shine and making the hair smooth and silky it does do as it states. Didn't add really any shine to my hair.  I was a little upset.  I have course dry hair so maybe that is why I can feel the difference in my hair as I spray it on while blow drying. My fingers just glide through my hair while I dry it after putting this stuff on. I've been purchasing these in bulk online since it's near impossible to find it in stores anymore. I hope they don't ever completely stop making this product!Also, if my hair starts to feel a little dry later in the day.....I give my hair a quick spray and if fixes it immediately.For me - I got through this stuff reeeaaally fast. I wash my hair everyday and I use a lot of product. I also have long, thick hair - but I use about a bottle a week. apparently did not hold far enough away from my hair as my hair was 'gummy' ... too hard to create enough distance with arms and without spraying all over surrounding things.",1,4,-3

Too much gets greasy. It leaves my hair soft and healthy and I love the fresh, clean scent.I've used a ton of products to try to help my dry hair. I color it once a month and I'm in my early 70s.  I wash it every other day. I've found nothing better. I used to use cheap shampoo, and my hair always looked dry.  I'm a guy, so like most guys, I didn't care.One day, after my old barber retire (during covid), I was at my new hair cutter.  The lady that was cutting my hair and I were talking during my haircut.  I had told her a used to have a job that required a hard hat, and my hair had begun thinning on top.  I told her that I used a certain shampoo because it's got 5 vitamins and minerals, and she laughed.  She said I needed something that moisturizes.After trying a few different shampoos, I remembered hearing that Paul Mitchell (John Paul Degioria) was good.  So I tried this one, and my hair looks and feels so much better!  I've usually always shampooed daily, so I never had a problem with dandruff, but my hair was dry looking.  Now, my hair looks RICH!  It's really the best way to put it.  It's become golden (I'm a blond) again, and it looks fuller on top!  My scalp even feels better and healthier!Now, when I use it, I lather it up and let it sit there for a minute or two before I wash it out....something I've never done before, so that may help, too.  But I just believe that this is a great, quality product, and it smells great, too!The only drawback is the price.  It's not cheap, but great products seldom are.  I've finally gotten to the age (52) where i started thinking, let me me do good things for my body regardless of the price, and my hair is thanking me for it! Great shampoo.  Gives my hair a nice shine and a very clean feel while leaving it very manageable. Love the shampoo and how moisturizing it is. The smell lingers all day, but it’s not unpleasant. I would love if it had a pump like the conditioner, but that is a minor detail. Most of the shampoo was inside the bag so I lost a bit of product. Would definitely recommend this shampoo! This stuff is great. I’ve been using for a few years now and smells good and seems to work work. It’s shampoo that seems to condition too. I only use this now along with the hair and body lotion daily. It ain’t cheap but good stuff I received my shampoo today.  It was leaking shampoo which was upsetting to me.  I am keeping it because I was out but I wanted you to be aware of this happening.  And I hope it doesn't happen again.Thank you,Vanessa Williams Very good shampoo but expensive Doesn’t lather as much as the traditional tea tree shampoo, but it is a bit more moisturizing. I’ll be switching back to traditional tea tree.",5,5,0

That I can say is true because I myself have ordered a set and received a watered down shampoo that almost falls through your fingers. I was upset that I had spent money on this and the product didn't meet my expectations. However, it really depends on what SELLER you choose to order from. The last time I ordered this set I purchased it from the seller: APPEAL. I received the watered down shampoo and was very disappointed because this set really is great for my hair! After I had run out, I decided I'd give them one more try, and if I received at crappy product again I would try and find this set at a local salon (even though the price would be much higher than here). I chose a different seller: NY Supply and this time the product I received was exactly how I remember the shampoo to be, nice and thick! It works just like I remembered it to and made my hair feel healthier after just one wash. My advice to anyone trying to purchase this product is to search through the sellers that carry this product and go with one that has a really good review. I can at least vouch for NY Supply, they sent me the product I was expecting without any disappointment.This is the best Shampoo and Conditioner set I have ever used. I saw the reviews online and decided to give it a try. I'm sure glad that I did because I will never switch products again. I have extremely fine hair which gets very oily and requires me to wash it everyday. This stuff is really great, I can now go without washing my hair for a day and it still looks fresh and clean without the oil. My hair has never looked healthier. Usually my hair just falls flat and looks very dried out and dull. This product brings your hair to life and gives it tons of volume. It may be a bit expensive by a little goes a long way. One bottle has lasted me a few months and I've used maybe half a bottle. It smells great and doesn't leave a build up residue on your hair. Not to mention it's made in the USA and doesn't use the harsh chemicals other shampoos and conditioners use. I would recommend this product to anyone whose hair is flat and dried out. A must buy. I really am not a fan of spending a lot of money on good shampoo or conditioner, only because I don't like my family using it since they don't have hair color they deal with.  That means I have to buy separate shampoo and conditioner for the family and it just makes things complicated.  (Family of 6, half girls and half boys.)My stylist turned me onto this shampoo and conditioner some time ago but I did not want to spend the money on it so I never reordered.  However, I did really like it.  I was once again in the market for affordable shampoo and conditioner that wouldn't strip my hair of its color which is pitch black.  I was searching online and had no idea that this shampoo and conditioner was sold on amazon (I never thought to look) and I was stoked to find not only was it available but it was more affordable in a bigger bottle.  I went ahead and purchased and remembered why I liked the shampoo and conditoner to begin with.You absolutely do not need a lot, so the large bottles I bought (33.3 oz) will last forever being that my hair is really short.  I have confidence in knowing it won't prematurely strip my hair of its color that I pay a lot of money to get.I highly recommend this product. Holds hair color and  smells great. I always used Wen but their prices have skyrocket over the last year I gave Enjoy a try and I like it. My wife has has difficulty getting this product at the usual stores I've been using Enjoy for about 10 years.  I know how this stuff is supposed to feel in my hands.  I've ordered it from a Amazon sellers before and had good experiences.  This was my first time ordering from APPEAL.  When I opened the shampoo and used it for the first time, it felt really runny.  It was running off my hands before I could even get it on my head.  But it smelled fine and washed my hair normally so I thought maybe I was imagining it.  I have travel-size bottles of the shampoo and conditioner that I bought from a brick-and-mortar store and I compared the consistency.  The conditioner seems the same but the shampoo that I bought from a store was definitely thicker.Since it was cleaning my hair and the price was cheap, I decided to just use it as normal and not make a fuss.  It was definitely a learning experience; I now know that when I buy a bottle of the unaltered product in the future, I can water it down a bit myself and make it stretch a little further, if I feel the need.  The difference?  I'll be doing it with full knowledge that I'm watering down my own shampoo and I'm the one who will have shampoo that lasts longer.See, that's the problem here, seller.  You were dishonest.  You said you were selling one thing but you delivered an inferior product.  Not cool. Nobody likes feeling taken advantage of by a shady business transaction.  I won't be doing business with you anymore.Update: I just ordered this from seller NY Supply (as recommended by another reviewer) and both the shampoo and conditioner seem fine. Doesn’t seem to be the real thing! I have bought this product before in different sizes and for whatever reason it just did not have the same consistency and fragrance. I would not purchase this product again. I tried this one multiple times and easy to order and good to use. I had a stylist recommend this set to me and I've been using these products for over a year now.  The shampoo doesn't lather quite the way I'd like it to, but the end results with the conditioner are great!  I don't feel that I get any build up or residue and I now feel my frizzy and hard-to-manage hair is back on track and healthy.  I also love that it's sulfate-free, making my color last a lot longer.  I have pretty straight har, but it's coarse and frizzy if I don't use good products on it.  I also highly recommend the En Joy hair masque if you need some extra TLC for your hair.  Love it!",1,1,0

My hair stylist uses this as the final touch before I head out the door in order to give my hair lots of gloss.  I've liked the little bit of extra sheen that it gives my hair, but I'd never bought my own bottle of it, until now.  It just seemed like too much bother to do an extra step at home, plus the added expense.The last time I was there, I picked up her bottle of this serum and that was the first time that I noticed it was also formulated to reduce frizz (before, she'd just mentioned, ""This is to make your hair glossy."").  I'd always just attributed my fresh-from-the-salon hair behaving better to her skills with hair.  Turns out, though, that this was part of the trick in keeping my hair from getting wild frizzies later in the day and the following morning.It just takes a *tiny* amount.  Really.  Otherwise, you'll end up with greasy-looking, weighted-down hair.  And you won't get any extra shine by using too much either.I put one *slight* pump (about pea-sized) into my palm and rub my hands together to create just a light film all over my palms and fingers.  Then I lightly brush my hands all over the surface of my hair, occasionally doing a bit of ""scrunching"" of my loose waves and curls.This stuff seems like it's out of stock half the time.  My hair stylist carries it, but she charges more than I've paid on Amazon. I typically love Schwarzkopf products, and their OSIS line is probably my favorite hair product line of all time, so when I ran out of my usual serum I decided to give this a shot. Unfortunately I don't like this serum at all, and it's probably one of the worst serums I've probably ever tried.First it's incredibly thick. I liken the thickness to a foundation primer. Maybe even thicker than Smashbox's Photo Ready.This makes it almost impossible to smooth evenly through the hair, even if using a brush or comb. I have used it a number of times now, and I always end up with one area somewhere where there is way too much and my hair looks oily, stringy and greasy. The only time I've experienced a problem like this consistently is when I'm using a really crappy product. I go out of my way to make sure that the amounts of product I'm using isn't too much and that its distributed evenly through my hair.Second, this serum is just straight up silicone. Silicone may be great for smoothing and shine, but in this kind of concentration it seems to create buildup, is difficult to wash out without a clarifying shampoo, and leaves my fine, thick hair looking dull, weighed down and lanky.When using, my hair does not hold a style and is almost impossible to curl. When my hair is heat styled with this serum in it, my hair looks piecey in a way that makes my hair look like it hasn't been washed recently. It makes my curls fall out quickly and actually causes more frizz when heat styled.Third, the shine it provides is not a natural looking shine. It makes my hair look plastic, and honestly even looks plastic when it's not controlling frizz. I don't know how that's pulled off but this serum manages to  accomplish it.And fourth, it is actually not very effective in humid climates. I live in TX and I bought this during summer when the humidity was been between 80 to 100% and my hair was incredibly frizzy when using this. It was so bad that I had to just buy my regular serum (Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum) and stop trying to make this work for me.So all in all, I really don't like this product. Out of all the Schwartzkopf products I have bought over the last 10 years, this is the only one that I regret buying. I don't recommend it, especially for those with fine hair.It feels and performs like a serum that would have been around when frizz serums first started hitting the market in the late 90's. I won't be repurchasing this in the future. I have used this product for years from the days when I had thick curly hair to now at 78 with gray, thinning, dry hair. I have been looking for all natural products, as this one does have silicone if I remember correctly. I use it on dry hair with fly away, frizzy ends. It only takes a little before it weights the hair down. I put a drop of it on my finger tips and start from there--truly a very small drop. Easier to add more than get too much. Each person needs to experiment until the right amount works, but it's worth staying with it till that amount is found. I like my old Schwarzkopf hair gloss, but that is not produced any longer. This is milky in color, but does add glossy look to my silver hair when I use hair dryer. Does control frizz to thin hair. It refreshes the style perfectly.  It’s not greasy, yet it makes hair shine. Having coarse, curly, thick hair I am always attempting to calm it down. And now that I have lots of gray coming in, my hair is very dry. Hence, I use lots of oils to soften & shine. This product not only does that, but also adds some definition so I can style it better. Finally, something that works!!  Does not come with instructions to apply so...the best way to use the product is to put ONE pump on your fingers, rub together with your other hand and apply with first pass through on the roots.  Any fly away hair will be gone!.  If need be (which I have to do, due to thick hair), repeat the one pump and apply to the rest of your hair.  Sometimes I need to do 3 passes in total.  Do NOT do 2 or more pumps at once as the serum will completely flatten your hair and make it look greasy.",2,3,-1

This helps me to cut down my blow-drying time to about 5 mins. So I've had this for a couple if months and I finally had yo throw it away.It's soo tight that it hurts my head and gives me a headache.  I tried yo loosen it up as much as possible but it just too tight. I love this towel! I can wrap my hair in it and forget about it while it dries! Also, love that is microfiber no breakage and my hair is frizz free! Love this thing! I have really long thick hair that soaks up water like a sponge. I had a microfiber one of these from another brand at Ulta. My hair eventually grew too long and thick and I could barely get it up on my head then the elastic piece that goes around the button stretched beyond wearing and I scraped it for floor washcloths.This thing is my new investment. I have butt length hair very thick and it takes it all! I sleep in it with masks on and it stays on ALL NIGHT through tossing and turning. It’s light weight and doesn’t add a lot of weight to my head which can be hard on my neck as it is. It is made so well. Every stitch, the fabric is soft and wonderful. The rubber like bag it came in is great for traveling with it tooo. It does not dry my hair completely even overnight however I didn’t expect it to because of the thickness and length of my hair. It does dry a lot more than previous ones I’ve owned and stays on so well without pulling my hair which I’m really concerned about since my hair is bleached, I like that it is gentle but firm in place. It’s really absorbent but also dries fast and is light weight. It doesn’t stay soaking wet all night and make you cold if you sleep in it. This product is a really cool invention. What bothers me is the size. Feels too little for the length of my head but at the same time feels too long for the length of my hair (couple fingers below shoulders). It's a bit weird. Still cool product tho. Gonna keep giving it a try. It works well for drying and amazingly, my hair is super soft …but the loop doesn’t reach the button. Had to use safety pin. I didn’t notice when i purchased that it’s shorter than their average size… more likely to fit a child’s head. I was so looking forward to using this for my long, thick hair that takes quite awhile to dry. However, it pinches at the ears something fierce!  I had to loosen it because it was starting to give me a headache.  I even tried stretching it out a bit but it has no give to it.  As much as I would like to keep this, I can't use something that gives me a headache.  Not sure why this is designed to be quite so tight, it should be more stretchy especially around the ears. I have very long hair, which goes down below my lower back and I can still tuck it in the bottom of this and pull it up slightly,and when I then twist and snap the bottom into place it still holds all my hair and helps dry. I think for my amount of hair a 2nd one would be best to truly dry my hair in a shorter amount of time, but one works fine overnight.I did put 4 stars because I see this same product in stores like Walmart, Target, TjMaxx for half the price or sometimes for 2 in one package and it's still cheaper. This is just towel material sewn in a convenient way so while it's a great invention it's not a particularly difficult item to produce or from unusual materials, so I feel like the price should lower, or the material should be much more luxurious to account for the higher cost. This is just a normal terry cloth or similar type feeling not soft or attractive looking.",3,5,-2

quite awhile careful wearing light colored shirt couple week,"Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Nourishing Permanent Hair Color Cream, B3 Golden Brown (1 Kit) Brown Hair Dye (Packaging May Vary), Pack of 1","I started with level 4 brown hair, coarse with low porosity. When I got out of the shower, I was disappointed because it looked like I had obvious hot roots. But once I dried my hair, that wasn't the case at all! The color was even, and looked exactly as it was on the box. My hair doesn't feel damaged at all. Sadly though, this hue looks too orange against my complexion (fair olive skin, blue eyes). So I'll be putting semi-permanent dye over it to correct that. I was looking for more of a violet in the purple range with this “ultra bold violet” color and I got more of a burgundy. It’s not awful. It was easy to apply. This pic is after two washes and there’s been no fading and no transfer to pillow or anything. The price was good, about 15 bucks for a two pack. I only needed one pack and my hair is longer than shoulder-length. My hair was previously colored from the middle on and had returned to a bleached color, and that section took more of the color. My grown out roots are dark brown and the color did tint that portion of my hair as well. I am satisfied but will try a color more in the purple range next time. Easy to apply and great color. Looks a little dark in low light but once your in the sun, the rich red color looks beautiful. Love this product and have been using it for years. Photo show three different dyes (same color, just different times) with three different levels of faded and lighting.The senior photo is the oldest, and as you can tell over time the red has kind of built up to be darker. This was 100% my fault as I never followed the touch up directions and just redyed all of my hair every time, instead of dying the roots for 20 and then the rest for 5 as directed.Also, I will say, if you forget to put the included oil in the dye (which I've done 1 time) it does become a little bit damaging. However, if you mix it as directed, it does not damage your hair at all. My hair is still, after 5+ years of dying with this product, incredibly healthy.I will definitely continue to use it as I love my red I only prefer Garnier.  They last long.  Doesn't burn or itch as much.  Easy to use and with the oils its easier on my hair. True to box color for medium brown hair Coverage is adequate. Color is bright. Color came out as it‘s shown on the box.",3,3,0

Large Butterfly Clamps, 12 Count","I bought these to use when for when I color my hair, blow dry or need to clip up my hair when I curl it. These clips will not hold a lot of hair so I twist my hair and have the clip hold the end. This works out well as the clips grasp the hair tightly. I am not concerned about the clips breaking. They have held up even though I'm not gentle on them.My hair does at times get caught in the teeth but slips out easily.These are great for use while styling or other needs like coloring but these are not for use once hair hair is styled. They will not work as a claw clip to wear out. Thought I would put that in my review as some might thing that is the purpose of these clips. They are holding hair up during procedures or while styling. These arrived in about 4 days. They are nice longer length, about 2.5 or three inches across. They have a strong clamp, not too strong for my weakened fingers.I plan to use them to hold my hair in sections to touch up the roots each month, or so. I try to avoid re-bleaching all my hair. And also to avoid the salon  costs. Platinum blonde takes some strong bleach and some extended time. These are up to the requirements. Plastic is bestAnyway, if you need good clips or also need plastic for hair coloring, even the Sallys-type supply stores are not cheaper. (Free delivery at this point!)Will buy more of these if more will be needed as it grows longer. I got a hack job, I have to recoup! I think a dozen will be ok to start on 4 inch, fine/thinner hair, for starters.Yes, worthy, without doubt, of 5 stars..ALL is worthy, its that simple sometimes. I am a dedicated beauty guru, and I must say that these clips are truly amazing. The price was definitely a bargain, But I am even more surprised when these clips came in the mail today and they are sturdy even for my curly and thick longer length hair. The count and color was ON POINT and I believe they can withstand this Arizona heat, since the heat out here can make even the best of the best products have some issues or fall apart faster.These clips are a life saver, and I didn't have to break the bank because again I LOVE TO SAVE JUST AS MUCH AS I LOVE TO SHOP.THANK YOU!! These clips are nice and lightweight which is perfect for me because I get headaches when I wear hairbands or clips that are too heavy or tight. 12 come in a pack so they are perfect for clipping your hair back when trying to style it or they can be used to quickly throw your hair up in a cute little bun. Ideal for people who have medium to thin hair, I am not sure how they would hold up if you have really thick hair. However if you have thick hair and just want to do a partial up-do or want to keep your hair sectioned off while styling, these would work for you! I originally give this three stars because the description says large butterfly clamps but they aren't large at all. I later read the dimensions on it and it clearly listed 2X3X2 so I can't ding the seller for that. They have a flimsy feel to them but they hold up just fine for my wife.  I guess the quantity included and the price of the package should have given me a better idea of the quality, especially with the size. If you are in search of the large clamp that will secure an up-do, this is not it. These are rather small and should be labeled medium size. Light weight, bendable plastic. Not the cheap flimsy type that breaks. I purchased the to hold my hair up off of my neck to stay cool during the summer months. Perfect for my hair. If you have really thick hair, I do not know how they will work for you because the teeth are pretty short but overall, I am very happy with these clamps. If I had purchased these in a local store, they would have been about 12 - 15 dollars. BARGIN at this price! I purchased these to use when my hair is wet and I'm waiting for it to dry, during coloring, or when I am curling it. They work perfect to hold back sections of my hair while I work on the rest. They are strong and thick so I am not worried about breaking them. I have shoulder length medium thick hair and I have no problems using them to hold a little or a lot of my hair. It was just the right size pack for me having the 12 count. Arrived safely and quickly. Great bargain for the quantity and quality of what you get. I have purchased these at other retailers in store previously and they didn't last a month before breaking. Having dropped these and leaving them in my purse daily I haven't had one break yet. I use these clips to hold my hair back when I wash my face and/or put on makeup. I have really long, thick and heavy hair and I was able to hold all of my hair up with one clip, but I wouldn't recommend doing that since it can pull on your head and kind of hurt. I think two is perfect for me and they are light and easy to use. I will continue using these clips to help keep my hair out of my face while I'm brushing my teeth, washing my face, putting on makeup or any other thing I might need them for.",2,4,-2

I'm loving this color I used Red and magenta with 30 volunizer and yes I can see the red and loved it. It did needles nger than the 30 minutes (40) to get the desired results. The only downside is the strong ammonia smell lingered in my hair (going to use rose water hope it clears that up). Process was easy. Definitely recommend this I saw some say their items arrived damaged my ne where package in plastic and arrived unscathed I’ve put my hair through a lot of colors, most importantly blue was under the black on the left side of my head and I was afraid I would have to bleach it for it to work out but I didn’t need to at all! I used 20 volume developer and Ion lightning cream and put a grocery bag over my head and sat Infront of a heater for an hour. The only reason I did 4 stars instead of 5 is because It came out more Hayley Williams orange rather than natural ginger but I am still obsessively Inlove with it! 100% will use again Red is usually the color I order but this specific listing DOESN'T HAVE ANY RED. They say it's red but it's actually ""magenta."" Don't order the red from this listing. Order from other listings. Otherwise, this product is usually very nice and lasts months. Best red dye. No pre bleaching needed. I love this product I use it all the time and will buy again and again I'll have this auto sent from now on! Great product! Lindo color, magenta y red !

Éclair","Not for dark brown or black hair.  Won't color the dark hair and will only color the gray/white so ended up with reddish brown on roots and no change to the rest of hair causing a two-tone effect. It comes out super nice and has a beautiful, iridescent brown color. I said I like to use super blue oil bleach with this instead of the other bleach Included as an added layer of protection. I've been using this kit for years! I took a break and was paying hundreds of dollars at a salon to get very similar results. Now I see it's technically been discontinued. 😭 I don't apply the base color all over, I just use a brush to apply it to select areas to add some dimension to my natural color. Then I do the same with the bleach - focusing mostly on the front but adding a few little highlights throughout as well. Love the effect of both products. This is a two-step process and you have to dry your hair after the first color, so I waited a day then did the second step, it turned out beautiful.  I just wasn't prepared for two steps on dry hair.  The color was shinny and really had beautiful blond highlights,  So if you don't mind taking the time it's a worthy endeavor. I been using this to highlight my hair for years! Was buying it from a drug store...amazon so much cheaper! AND easy to use! I've been dying my hair for over 20 yrs now. I'm a natural redhead but I prefer it a shade deeper than my natural color... It looks really good as a deep Auburn, especially with my fair skin. For a while now, I've been using John Frieda Foam Hair Color, and before the I used L'oreal Feria until they discontinued my color. Lately, I've been thinking about how when I was in my 20s,I still dyed my own hair but in the Summer, I would always go to the Salon and get Caramel colored Highlights which always earned me a ton of compliments. So, I figured I'd find a way to Highlight my hair at home, my first try was A Highlighting kit by Clairol and it was such a hot mess that I realized early on there was no way it was going to work out well for me and I threw the mixture away before coloring one Strand. It wasn't user error, just a really cheap and horrible at home highlight system. I was nervous after that about trying any other at home systems but I've been eyeing this system by L'oreal up for a couple months before I took the leap. The most difficulty I had was trying to choose the color... My intuition told me to go for the Darker one but I played it safe and decided to see how the Copper one turned out. Even though I now know the darker shade is the color I'm looking for, I'm not unhappy by any means with how my hair turned out with the lighter Red shade. This is a 2 step system that is so user friendly, even a beginner will get gorgeous results. So, I used the base shade to dye all my hair, then blow dried it, mixed up the highlighter mixture and took a leap of faith. I found the finger swipe was easier to use because the brush bent to easily and also tended to tear out a bit of hair with each swipe. You have to be patient and take your time because after the first few strands, it became a bit more difficult to separate the strands exactly how you want and when you started swiping the highlights on, extra strands would get in the way as the tools became covered in the thick mixture. But even with the occasional unwanted hair that ended up highlighted, I was very impressed with the end results, especially considering this was the 1st time highlighting my own hair. I have thin, fine hair and I started by clipping the top layer of hair out of the way and Highlighted some strands on the bottom layer of my hair starting at the back and working to the front. I didn't want really thin highlights so I alternated from thick Highlights to medium thickness. When I let down my top layer of hair, I focused on face framing highlights... I barely had just enough of the mixture to do my hair and as I said, it's very thin, fine and only shoulder length. A lot of people would have to buy 2 kits to have enough highlighter for all their hair. After 10 minutes, I could clearly see the highlighted stand were significantly lighter, so I rinsed out and applied the included conditioner which I really like a lot. After drying and styling my hair, I knew I would never worry about doing my own highlights again as long as this product is around. It turned out a lot better than I ever expected and did not leave my hair dry and brittle. I have this on Subscribe and Save now but switched to the darker shade. These pics will give you a good idea of how the finished color looks even though I'm wearing it pulled up. Definitely the best at home hair product ever! Does the job perfectly! This is my second order and will keep ordering.. product is satisfying! 👍👍 Hair",2,2,0

hair use apple cider vinegar rinse hair look amazing,"Dr. Bronner's Fair Trade & Organic Hair Conditioning Rinse - Citrus Orange, 8 Ounce","Very good product but I think is a little product,Excelent ingredients Dr Bronner's service rep said that this has a pH level of 3… which, assumed, that if the water was alkaline, this pH would be a bit higher than a 3.  Initially used ratio as per instructions - 1-2 capfuls per cup of water, assuming cup was 8oz.This was used as conditioner/ rinse for HOMEMADE SHAMPOO (1.5cups Organic Pure Virgin Coconut Milk + 1.75cups Aloe Gel) with an assumed pH level of between 4 and 6.  Turns out the combination tested (using pH strips) to be around 5.Out of curiousity, and because I wanted to truly test the pH levels, I ordered some of pH Test Strips…  WHOA!!!  The pH level for Dr B Rinse concentrate did not hit 3 at all … it was a 1!!!  Perhaps I misunderstood the rep and she meant it has a pH of 3 after it was mixed with water?  It was not!!!  Even 1 capful to 1 cup of water still had it at 1, maybe 2!!!  My water was about a 9 and adding the ratio (as per instructions) barely brought up the level.After a few tests, it turns out that only maybe about 2-3 drops of DrB Rinse + 8 oz water brings the pH level to a 3.  So if the correct pH level is critical for you, use pH Test Strips to test your shampoo, water and mixes before using these!!There are plenty of reviews for the combination of Coconut Milk+Aloe Gel Shampoo followed by ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) Rinse… many stating that it could take weeks to get the ""greasiness"" on the hair out during the ""transition period.""  Since I was not interested in ACV, I opted for this as the rinse - similar pH.  By testing out the actual pH, and having 5 for the shampoo and 3 for the rinse, I found that the transition took only 4 days.  Hair adjusted well VERY quickly… and air drying hair was actually good.  And less falling hair - perhaps because it's naturally detangles in the shower.EXCELLENT - as long as the pH is tested. So I’ve used this product a couple of time and I already absolutely love it. First off; eco friendly and 100% biodegradable, off to a great start.Second; you can see all the reviews telling you the same thing I am; FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! As long as you follow the directions, I can’t see how you wouldn’t love this product (if you have a similar hair texture to me that is, can’t speak for all hair textures)Instead of going through How To use it, like so many other reviewers have, I’m going to give some tips and tricks to getting it to work for you!So a little backstory about my hair; I long hair (about to my mid back) my hair gets greasy and oily on my scalp after shampooing in about 2-4 days (depending on what I did etc.). Most of the time I can go about 3 days without shampooing my hair, and when I shampoo my hair I only shampoo my scalp. I have been using a shampoo bar for a couple of years now and this is the the routine I’ve fallen into. However I shower about everyday, and if I get my hair wet I always needed to condition the ends of my hair otherwise it was a mess to manage. (I only ever condition the ends of my hair, which is the majority of my hair). If I didn’t condition it not only would it feel dry, but it would tangle easily and was a horrible texture. So I was in this process of shampoo my scalp ever 3 days but needing to condition my ends almost everyday to upkeep texture and appearance.Flash forward to this product; the first time I used it I followed the direction and ran the rinse from my scalp all the way to my ends. After my first time realizing this I noticed I did NOT need to do that. My scalp produces enough oil, it does not need to be conditioned. So if you already don’t condition yourself scalp, you shouldn’t need to run the rinse through your scalp at all. (I don’t at least)What I do is I keep a mason jar in my shower, I add about 1 and 1/2 capfuls of the rinse with a cup of water and then I put the ends of my hair (which my hair is already wet at this point) in to the mason jar. I let it sit there, take my hair out, move the product around in my hair, and repeat about 2 times. I then pour an extra liquid on the ends of my hair and spend some time working the product into the ends of my hair. Then I rinse. And I rinse/massage my hair for a good 2-3 minutes. It is hard to tell when your hair has gotten rid of the extra product, but it only took me one time of not rinsing it enough to figure out what works for me.Again this stuff is great, after I get out of the shower I use the peppermint Dr. Bronzers hair creme after I’ve towel dried my hair and it’s been great. Silky soft and smooth, has not disrupted my routine, and this stuff smells SO good. Such a natural smelling s bent, genuinely like you’re putting oranges on your head. I love that it does not smell artificial and fake. The scent holds and this paired with the hair cream hold my natural waves so well. It’s amazing. Truly 10/10. Have been looking for a great conditioner that works for me since I went ""natural"" with all beauty products five years ago - was hoping this would be it...but it's not:(Pros: It smells great (to me - I do like citrus) - and if you don't like the smell - it doesn't hang round once you rinse it out. It also worked much better than most natural conditioners that I have tried - those tend to make my hair look and feel pretty nasty.  It rinses clean and it de-tangled my hair nicely - I was able to comb through it easily after washing.Cons: It really dried my ends out - and didn't leave my hair with that shiny, soft, luxurious look that I was hoping for - and miss so much from my days using Pantene conditioner.  I think that if I used it long term - it might possibly dry my hair out all over (I used it for two weeks). I tried it with both my regular shampoo and using diluted Dr. Bronner's soap (which I have not liked as a shampoo in the past) - the results were much better when NOT using the Dr. Bronner's which does not agree with my hair:(Overall: Give it a try - it might work for you - and as I said - it did work much better than pretty much anything else I have tried.  I miss the days of just letting my hair dry and having it look great...I am open to suggestions if anyone has had luck with another product (and yes I have tried all the vinegar rinses, etc.). (FYI - I have long, medium hair - but a lot of it (so it looks thick).  I have an oily scalp and (now) dry ends. I don't color or heat treat my hair in any way - just wash every other day and comb out.) First, I love this product. Great with Dr. B’s shampoo.The only downside, and it isn’t that bad at all, is there is a process with this. It must be mixed with water.Helpful tip, buy a squirt bottle. I bought a plastic food service bottle. One capful in a full bottle (I think 12oz). Rinse thoroughly.Smells great, rinses clean, shiny, and smooth.",1,4,-3

I would love an option to buy a larger quantity at a lower cost per unit! Ok, so how different can it be?  They aren't snag-free but as good as it gets with a hold for my Asian hair.  While Scunci No Damage & Kai bands are about the same as far as snagging, BLAX has a way tighter hold, especially for those who do NOT have as much hair.  NOTE: BLAX 4mm and 2mm bands are 1.625 inches in diameter (1.5 inch plus 1/8th).PROs:*About as snag-free as it gets for a band (snags less than Kai bands, maybe a little bit better than/equal to Scunci No Damage/Goody)*Best tight hold. Hands-down tighter than Scunci, Goody & Kai.*Best hold for people with less/thinner hair.  Band diameter is ~1.5 inches, significantly smaller than Scunci No Damage, Goody & Kai bands.*Band stretches out less after use than other brands (Scunci, Goody & Kai).  Mine stretch out ~20%.CONs:*Can be a little more difficult to tighten your ponytail by pulling strands of your hair given the tightness of the band.*While the hold does NOT loosen at all during the day, the band does slide down a bit (~1/4 inch after a few hours if you don't tighten your hair).*Have to order online.I ordered mine from Best Buy Beauty in NoHo/LA, CA. My order shipped within 24hrs and I received it in a few days. I was a little suspicious when I saw how small these are, since I have pretty thick hair, but they really work, and hold well. They're especially nice because they are thin and don't have much of a profile when in your hair. I haven't had one break, even though I was worried it might, because they feel very stretchy at the beginning. While they do get a bit more pliable with use, I've never had them stretch permanently to where they're unusable.My biggest issue with them is that I can't put them around my wrist comfortable to have on hand, but it's fine of you can carry them around some other way. Got these for my 2-year-old who has thick, fine curly hair.  It is true that they don't snag in her hair.  The problem is that they're only a little bit elastic, so to get them to stay on properly, I have to wrap it around until it's on pretty tight.  Then when I remove it, there's no elasticity available to stretch it out and easily pull her poofy pony tail through.  So I have to slowly inch it off (except it's more on the order of centimeters), while holding tightly to the base so I don't yank her head.  And yes, it doesn't get snagged in that process, but it's time consuming and no easy feat on a squirmy 2 year-old.  This is probably not an issue for people whose hair is straight/wavy and maybe even for looser curls, but hers are really tight and result in quite a poof.  And I'm sure people who are older could manage the removal, but it still seems like it would be annoying They don't snag, don't pull, and don't catch on my hair. They also don't fall off even if I sleep with them on, though they will slide down my hair in that case.While they probably aren't as durable as a full-on, thick-elastic-corded, felt-covered hair-binder, they definitely last a long time.Somewhat regrettably, they do tend to stretch-out due to a need to twist-then-rewrap, but I've never had a single one snap on me -- they stretch out and maintain their strength even once they're WELL-beyond three-times their original length.Assuming I ever need to get additional ones, I definitely will. If someone hadn't thrown out some of the ones from my original package because they were stretched-out (and to them, apparently looked no-longer-useful --__--  ) then I would still have all the ones from my first pack. As it is, I still have 7 of them, 2 unused, so I'm good for quite a while. I was skeptical but these little hair bands are the real deal. My long hair (hey! I'm a die hard hippie! ☺) was beginning to thin exactly where I have been putting it up into a pony-tail when I ride my Harley; I can't ride with my hair down or the very fine hair I have knots up really bad. I almost have to cut the tangles out! My hairdresser told me the ""non-damaging"" cloth covered ties I had been using were evidently snagging as I removed them, which was common. She gave me a few rubber-band type ties to try, they were even worse so I hit the Net looking for reviews and found these. They hold your hair in place 10-times better and when removing them they just glide off like you have oiled them! It's almost inconceivable that they could have both properties, tight hold and ease of removal, but take my word they do. Two-thumbs up! ↑↑ The price for 8 of these little tiny bands is ludicrous. What am I missing? Plus they are so tiny- you will lose them within a week. Not sure what the appeal is. I'd recommend these for those of you who need a really strong elastic, one that does not slip at all. I love these for the gym and running. I never have to adjust my ponytail during workouts. I wouldn't call them ""snag-free"" but they are not damaging. If you just need casual elastics to pull your back for around the house, no need to splurge on these. They are rather pricy, but you can re-use so not a bad bang for your buck.",2,4,-2

Realmente soy de sus resultados efectivos solo dos meses llevo y una vez al día lo aplico. Si bien es cierto no he usado ningún tipo se esmalte en mis uñas hasta terminar mi tratamiento I hated to spend this much money, but this stuff is so worth it!!! I have always had fingernails that peel therefore they could never grow long. Add to that, when I wear nail polish they peel even worse (I think from drying out?)So, I hadn’t worn nail polish in months. I finally decided to buy this product, I used it religiously for seven weeks morning and night. My nails were starting to grow and were stronger. The big test was when I decided to start wearing polish again, which has been several weeks now. My nails have not peeled at all. I am very impressed! I’ll continue to use it and buy  another bottle when I run out!Oh And I still use this twice a day. And I’ve been applying this around the cuticle and right at the tip of the nail.Give it a whirl I can’t imagine anyone would be disappointed😊😊😊 After three glorious months of gel manicures and then six months of pathetic, peeling, splitting, broken nails, I asked my dermatologist for advice. Other than to stay away from gel manicures, she recommended this product. I was initially taken back by the price, but my nails were embarrassing. I haven't been using this product for very long, less than three weeks, but my nails have stopped peeling and feel stronger. This is a very encouraging sign.This is a clear liquid that goes on with a small rod inside the cap. You place a few drops at the base of the nail and then allow the fluid to flow over the rest of the nail and let it dry without touching or massaging it into the nail. You then apply a good moisturizer on top.You are supposed to do this twice a day, but sometimes I forget.After the application of DermaNail, my nails look somewhat dull but look better after I apply the moisturizer.The manufacturer recommends Cutemol Emollient Cream (which it makes) to be used in conjunction with DermaNail. Cutemol is a very thick, lanolin based cream that is best used at bedtime.Hopefully, I will continue to get good results. It's going to take at least another two months before I know for sure.UPDATE 6/18/2013:It has been almost six weeks since I started using DermaNail and I am very surprised how well it is working! The peeling and the splitting were the first to stop but now most of the chipping and breaking has been eliminated or greatly reduced. Very little of my original damaged nail is left, perhaps 1/4 of an inch and I can see the stronger, healthier nail growing in. I have been using the product twice a day, followed by either Cutemol or Argan oil massaged into the nail and cuticles. This did help slightly with my very difficult to grow, thin, weak, brittle, peeling nails (i have pretty much everything wrong that can go wrong with nails. It's genetics). The first coat of paint I did after the full 8 weeks of this treatment lasted a whole week. I've never had normal nail polish last that long. My nails were able to grow quickly using nail polish as the supporting structure (check out loudi That shows that this does work to an extent if you have genetically weak nails like I do.However, my nails, when natural, still couldn't grow very long. They were still weak without nail polish and would break frequently. So I continued to use nail polish to grow them long. But then i ruined the progress I made by using acetone nail polish remover. Please do not use acetone if you have genetically weak nails. I am doing a second course to help heal the damage I did to my nails with the acetone and going back to my non-acetone nail polish remover. The acetone dried out my nails to the point that they were breaking below the free edge and into the nail bed. As I get older my nails have become brittle.  DermaNail fixes that.  If used regularly, this produces nails that a manicurist will complement. East to use and I have only been using for two weeks. Hoping this will aid in my mail health. I bought this on the recommendation of my dermatologist back in September 2015.  The nail on my big toe split several years before (bad split).  No matter what I tried (trimming it back under the split like a meniscus cleanup or superglue to the split) it wouldn't grow right.  I was to the point I wanted to have the nail removed and hope it grew back.  The dermatologist recommended the DermaNail.  I read the reviews with mixed thoughts and bought it anyway (it was cheap enough).  I was hoping for a quick cure, but stuck with the application every day.  Finally after about 18 months (more than enough time for the nail to grow fully out at least 1X or more) the split finally appears to be gone.  I'm going to keep applying the DermaNail to the nail until the bottle is exhausted for good measure.  I gave it 4 stars only because it took SO LONG or I'd have given it 5 stars.So hang in there, it worked for me and hopefully will for you as well.Thanks DermaNail.",1,5,-4

Edit review March 27, 2015 --- I had to retire this hot brush because the cord began to be loose where it joins the body of the device.  I've just placed my order for the 3/4"" brush once again because I like this specific brush so much.I originally bought the 1 1/4 inch Instant Heat Hot Brush because I had allowed myself to be convinced by watching a demonstration of a similar product on television that the size would work well for my hair.  I was not all wrong, but after I used it a couple of times I wondered if I would have better results with a smaller brush.  I have short hair (does not cover my ears) which is very fine, but also thick and straight.  As it gets some length on it between haircuts it lays down completely flat on my head.  I need height and volume, but don't want curls.I bought the 1 1/4 inch brush and liked the convenience of it, but the brush was simply too large to wrap my hair around.  I had a lot of difficulty picking between the two sizes for my first purchase and quickly began to wonder if the smaller brush (closer to the size of my curling iron) might not be a better choice for me.  I ordered the smaller size and it does exactly what I want.  I get lots of volume, the cowlicks on the crown of my head are controlled, I don't have curls or waves, but the little tag ends of hair around my ears and nape of my neck now lay down flat.  Oh, and did I mention that I don't like to spend a lot of time fussing with my hair?  This small hot brush is perfect for me.Both brushes work and are designed exactly the same.  Everything pertains to both hot brush sizes.  There is an on/off button with red or green indicator light, turbo heat on/off button, a turbo heat indicator light, comfortable textured handle, chrome barrel, plastic bristles, and a cool tip.  Begin with clean, dry hair.  Damp hair works too, it just takes longer with more passes of the brush through the hair.  Styling products can be used on the hair.  Hair should only be wrapped around the brush twice so longer hair will require moving the brush along the length of the hair, beginning at the end.  Trust me, you don't want those plastic bristles to get tangled in your hair.  There is a temperature guide for the 25 possible heat settings, but you have to be prepared to experiment.  For my short, straight, fine, thick hair I have settled on a heat setting of 17 which Conair's chart considers medium-high.  I was surprised that it took that much heat.Turbo Heat is a feature which provides a constant amount of heat, no fluctuations caused because of power changes you have no control over.  I turn on the brush and turn on the Turbo Heat at the same time and for the setting of #17 that means it takes the brush over 1.5 minutes before the indicator light stops blinking.  That 30 second heat-up they talk about is for the lowest heat setting number with Turbo Heat not turned on.  If you turn the brush on and allow it to come up to heat, then turn on the Turbo Heat it will go through the entire heat-up time all over again.  Turn them both on at the same time if you are going to use Turbo Heat.I am really happy with this product.  I do not shampoo my hair each day and the volume stays in my hair very well.  If I want to refresh the style, I simply heat up the brush and run it through my hair as if I am simply brushing it.  That actually brings the volume back.  I tried today to change the style from the styling of yesterday and it actually did work.  This product has dual voltage ability, but you must buy an adapter that configures to the plug you will be using.  That information is easily available at various online sites.  I don't know if I will keep the larger brush or pass it along to one of my daughters or granddaughters.  Just remember to be careful when using the hot brush.  That chrome barrel gets very hot and will burn your fingers if you touch it.  Even the ""cool tip"" gets warm. I spent a small fortune on one of the newer ceramic - ion - flim flam curling brushes and to be honest, it works fine its just impossible to clean.  So from hair and product build up it's just not worth the effort.  I even bought a solution to use and it did disolve the build up and clean the brush barrel but it was a mess and not very easy to do.  So, I went back to basics and ordered this Conair curling brush which has a screw in the end you can remove and slide out the combs and soak and wash them so easily.  I don't think it was designed with that in mind but happily the ability to carefully remove and clean the combs is it's best feature.  I've had one of these before and don't know why I thought the latest technology would be better ... maybe it is but it's not worth it if you can't sanitize it.  Anyway,  this Conair version is wonderful.  It works exactly the same as the one that cost 10 times the price.  The key is to use with caution - just like you should with any heated product.  Keep it clean and keep your hair healthy and save yourself a lot of trouble (and money).  I bought two sizes of this curling brush and I love them both.  Thank you Conair for staying uncomplicated and efficient! The Conair Instant Heat Styling Brush, 0.75 Inch heats up quickly and actually has a rapid heat up button you can use when you plug in your brush, forget to actually turn it on and when you walk back to it, realize what you did (I've done that a time or two :(. The rapid heat up button saves my morning.The hand grip is well placed in relation to the controls and fits your hand well. No more twisting the brush and accidentally hitting the off switch! The brush ""bristles"" are gentle on the hair and are easy to clean.I had this styling brush before for quite a few years until it finally gave out. I headed right to Amazon to hopefully find the same model to replace the dearly departed brush. It was available and I actually ordered 5 of them since they are reasonably priced. Now I will have backups for many years to come and won't have to panic before work when the next one had completed its last curl :) It's not what I expected at all. This is like a curling iron without the grip to hold hair in place you have to wind iron to get it to curl at all and it has No Air like I thought ~MY MISTAKE ~ I think this would be fantastic on Med length hair (long enough it will wrap around the iron then slowly twist hair off. I used to l have one similar years ago when my hair was longer & I loved it. Now my hair is too short on front & I saw a blow dryer curling iron all in one & with my rhrmatoid arthritis I can't hold brush & blow dryer. I want to try the all in one. Sorry I looked at so many & then ordered in a hurry not making sure it was what I had wanted. Thank You 🙄 Great curling iron. I bought this to replaced a beloved tangle free rotating brush curling iron that is no longer on the market. Have had the hot sticks by conair  for two years now  and it is still in perfect working order even after hitting the tile floor a few times when accidentally knocked off the counter.. Heat is adjustable which is great when using for myself & daughter as our hair will curl differently and why use higher heat when you don't need to. The quick heat up button is perfect for when I forgot to plug it in and am running late. Also shuts off automatically if I forget to unplug it. Bristles do not get hot so it is easy to handle without getting burned. My long tangle prone hair does not get tangled or stuck in it- I just curl the top of the section I am working on first then slide it down  the length of my hair so it will curl the ends and roll all the way up to create one perfect curl. Curls hold for a long time, just let them cool down before you finger through them. The only thing that would make it better is if it had a button to let it rotate when removing from the hair like my old one did.",1,1,0

I just straightened my 4c hair tight coils with this serum and a paddle brush hair dryer unit. There was some smoking as the product burnt off, but my hair does not feel burnt. As a matter of fact, it’s silky and shiny! I did use too much of the product though, a little really does go a long way (like many of the other reviews say) but of course if something is good, I tend to go overboard! I used about 2 quarter size dollops for my thin but long hair and it was too much product for my hair. Next time I will use about half that amount, which lets me know this bottle will last a looooooong time. I do feel good about blow drying my hair with this serum, and don’t feel like I damaged any of it with the heat. I love the serum instead of the pump spray. My hair needs the added protection from the serum. My hair is softer and less frizzy. I purchased the serum before finishing the pump spray. Just because I found it. Its ok.  Value and protects your hair from the heat Just love it! I love the overall product.  It's not too greasy or not enough oil, it is the perfect amount.  It gives good shine and lasts.

With this shampoo I don't have to do that, which is awesome and kind of strange because this shampoo is free of sulfates and sulfates are what make shampoos foam up. I find that most shampoos bought from the drugstore and even some from salons have a watered-down consistency but the consistency for this shampoo is nice and thick so you don't have to use a lot of it to coat all of your hair. I think the fact that you have to shake the bottle before use helps the ingredients mix and aerates the product. It does take a bit longer to wash my long hair because you're supposed to let the shampoo sit for a couple minutes but it rinses off so cleanly and I've noticed my scalp is less itchy and dry right after washes.Most natural/organic products have a distinct smell, kind of fresh and raw as opposed to processed with a strong fragrance. This shampoo smells quite nice to me because of the essential oils and natural fragrances.As far as preventing hair loss it's difficult to say. It worked amazingly well the first month, the amount of hair that ended up in my shower drain was significantly less. I also have the conditioner but I am not a fan of that at all. It's not moisturizing for my dry hair and it doesn't help de-tangle, which makes it difficult to brush my hair wet, damp, or dry. After a month of using just the shampoo and the conditioner I started to mix a deep conditioner with the hair loss conditioner. It was easier to brush through my hair but I noticed hair falling out again. I think I'm going to stop mixing my deep conditioner with the hair loss conditioner and just use a leave-in conditioner that you can use on damp hair, but I will still use the deep conditioner once a week.I give this product 4 stars because it is expensive but I would definitely buy this shampoo again. It feels so much better on my hair and scalp than traditional shampoos and I don't feel like I'm wasting so much product trying to clean my hair. Hopefully this review helped those of you considering purchasing this product. This shampoo is absolutely fantastic. In March of 2017 I went through multiple life changing events that caused me a great deal of stress, as a result, it took a toll on my body. I lost over 30lbs within a month, and I began to notice my hair falling out. Sure, we all have experienced shedding due to stress, but I was experiencing shedding at an alarming rate. As the weeks went by the shedding got worse. Soon, months went by and before I knew it, my hair had thinned out by about 50%. I had to cut off 6 inches of my hair because it had thinned out so badly. I was suffering from something called Telogen Effluvium. My hair follicles had been shocked from the stress my body had endured. This caused my hair to stop growing and the shedding to begin. At the first sign of increased shedding I had switched my shampoo, I was using Biotin shampoo by re:line. This was helping for the first few weeks with the shedding, but I did not notice any new hair growth. This product claimed to regrow hair and also thicken hair, I never saw this happen. I was using this shampoo up until 2 weeks ago (10/1/17) when I switched to Just Nutritive's Hair Therapy Shampoo, and this was the best decision I could have made. I was defeated up until I started using this shampoo. I had tried hair masks, serums, I've been taking supplements daily, giving myself scalp massages. I was even avoiding blowing my hair dry. Anything I could do to help reduce the hair loss. Nothing seemed to be helping. I had lost so much hair that I was developing a small bald spot in the back of my head where I have a cowlick where my part ends. I developed scalp tenderness. It was awful. Of course the added loss of losing your hair only adds to the stress further, so it seemed like I was caught in a vicious cycle that was never going to end.Within the first week of use of Just Nutritive's Hair Therapy I noticed immediate results. My scalp actually tingled from the essential oils, I could tell that this product was helping to clear out any clogged hair follicles. After about the third wash, I noticed prickly hair all over my scalp, when giving myself a scalp massage. I couldn't believe it. I was so overjoyed that I actually began to cry. By day seven I was no longer losing gobs of hair in the shower like something out of a horror film. Everything seemed natural. Now, after 2 weeks of use, I combed my hair after my shower and only pulled out 4 strands of hair from my comb. The bald spot is no longer visible, my scalp tenderness is gone, the volume is slowly returning to my hair, especially at my scalp. I am not crazy about the smell of the product, but I am crazy about the results, so I can live with it. One thing I will mention is that I do shake the bottle before pumping as recommended. I also rinse my hair with cold water to help stimulate the hair follicles. I've seen it recommended to even use bottled water, but I live in Hamilton, OH and we're known for having the best filtered tap water around. Hamilton actually bottles and sells their tap water. Anyway, depending where you live, you may even want to try rinsing your hair with bottled water occasionally if you feel like your tap water could be causing further damaged to your hair. I am also using the Just Nutritive's Hair Therapy Conditioner. I've also purchased the Grow New Hair Treatment and I've begun using this oil when giving myself scalp massages. I've used this twice now.To sum things up, I love this product! I'll never go back to another shampoo. My hair feels healthy and clean; I no longer have build up. I cannot wait to see the results after a month of use. I'm looking forward to the day when my hair is long and thick again. Maybe even thicker than ever!",3,4,-1

woman with thin wavy hair I lost a lot of hair due to over processing and change of diet. my hair used to be so thick and pretty ughhhh .... A lot of people are saying it smells bad it doesn't. Its called natural lol. I use the tip to part my hair and gently squeeze while doing so. I put a silk bonnet on and sleep overnight.  When I wake up I wash my hair and it leaves my hair soft and looks fuller. I apply on dry hair. Also I massage it in my scalp for 3 min. Hope this helps. For reference I’m a black women, I see a lot of reviews saying that the product has a smell but those people are putting the oil all over there hair. I put the oil only on my scalp because I don’t really need help with split ends or really care for it because I trim my ends on a good basis. so if your scared because the oil smells… don’t be it’s very tolerable and I don’t even smell it In my hair especially since I have a bunch of products in my hair to keep my hair curly and not frizzy. I apply 3 times a week spread out. A good tip I have is if your scalp is itchy but your not quite ready to wash your hair yet, dampen just your scalp with a spray bottle and then apply the oil to your scalp and massage it in with your fingers, it will start to feel tingly and after 20 minutes your scalp will not be itchy for a good 2 days which gives me enough time to wash my hair.But definitely get this oil. I love this stuff & it F’n works!!! The BEST Part is, Amazon has it for a fraction of the price from the company’s website. The ingredients I posted are from the company’s website & are EXACTLY what’s listed on Amazon’s bottle.. Go look for yourself & compare it to my photo. I made sure I included the website address I typed in! This stuff is THE REAL DEAL! I've been purchasing this exact product for almost 10 years. And WOW. This is my go to recommendation for hair growth products! The smell is hit and miss. I love the smell of it, whereas my boyfriend hates it. But overall, incredible product with great results for the low price! I noticed a lot of people who use this have either fine fleece type hair or very curly hair.I have saxon hair so I get natural unwanted dreads because my hair is so thin and long.This is not a cure for hairline recession. But my scalp is healthier.I put a very light amount on my chops in the evening and over months of doing that I think it's made a healthier environment for facial hair to grow. I could never grow cheek hair and now there is some patches coming in. This hair oil grow edges instantly I had bald edges from a frontal and now I have full edges again. Fully recommend Have used this product for YEARS. Hasn’t failed me yet. Since I am passed menopause, I have been losing hair, and this oil has been recommended. So I just got the oil yesterday and I did a small test area on my hair. It worked! Very well! The last night I went ahead and use the oil on both my scalp and all my hair. I have very long hair, past my waist, but thin and I only needed a small amount for my whole scalp and hair. It took only 10 minutes for the oil to be completely absorbed! I washed it this morning and it looks great! Much less breakage! Very soft and not dry, no static or flyways! I am so relieved!! I will continue to use the oil! Thank you Wild Growth Oil!",2,5,-3

I have natural white / silver hair and every now and then I need to remove the hair products. It lathers nice and really cleans your hair squeaky clean. All to start all over again with all of the hair products build up 😢. But this is the sure fix😊 This has been the best clarifying shampoo that I have used to date. It did not tangle my heat damaged 4c hair and left my scalp feeling incredibly clean after usage. Both the shampoo and conditioner came packaged as advertised. They were sealed and didn’t show any signs on tampering. They don’t have much of a scent, but it’s not scent free either. The shampoo lathers up really nice and the conditioner works great! You barely need much to feel it working, which is almost instant once applied in the shower. I think it was worth the money. I wish it had more of a scent but that’s okay. This shampoo dries out my thin hair but I use it as a body wash. The city water is full of chlorine and causes my body/back to break out. I take small amount and wash my back to get the chlorine off. My back has cleared up almost completely. I'm currently six months into the process of letting my natural hair grow out from years of processing. I often use a co-wash instead of shampoo to keep my hair from becoming overly frizzy, but that also weighs down the hair with extra oils.  I also have to deal with hard mineral-laden water that tends to give my hair brassy tones which I combat with purple shampoos. When styling my hair I add mousse and finishing sprays, and all of these things can add up to making my hair coated and unable to absorb moisture to keep frizz at bay!  This is where this product comes in.Paul Mitchell Shampoo Three is a clarifying shampoo.  It cleans your hair of ""gunk"" deposits, erasing the crud that's accumulated on your scalp and hair, giving you a renewed palate to deep condition and style as desired.I have used this product once and I love the way it works! It takes very little of it to get a good lather going. After gently agitating the shampoo through my hair and on my scalp I rinsed my head well.  The product didn't leave my hair feeling smooth, but it did make it feel clean.  I then followed the cleansing with a deep conditioner for five minutes and then rinsed. I used a leave-in conditioner and some mousse to produce a smooth, easy to manage style that felt soft to the touch.The thing is, I have naturally curly hair that tends to be frizzy due to lack of hydration being retained no matter what I put on it. This product wiped away the stuff that was not allowing my hair to absorb the moisture offered by the conditioners and produced a great hair day.I definitely recommend this product, but not to be used every day unless your lifestyle assaults your hair with chlorine or similar each day.I'm very happy to have found this product and I think it is a wonderful option for deep cleansing without stripping your hair. Seems to get the chlorine out pretty well.I like it for after swimming seems to help alot. Will order again. I don’t write many reviews but this shampoo saved my hair.I was stuck in a vicious cycle of washing with normal shampoo and conditioner, oily hair after a day, repeat. I’ve tried it all, or so I thought. The buildup was so bad that I had grease streaks constantly and nothing helped. I have medium textured long hair so it was a chore to keep fighting with it. After scouring the internet for a fix, I came across this shampoo. Sources said that using a clarifying shampoo is beneficial so I decided to try it.After the first wash, I was so ecstatic. The grease was GONE. I now use it once a week or so to remove any buildup of products and it still cleans and leaves my hair feeling light and bouncy. Highly recommend! My daughter uses this shampoo because her hair will get a moldy scent from going to bed with wet braided hair. Works the first time. Scent is lemony. Leaves her hair soft",5,5,0

It was amazing quality and the color was to die for. After years I wanted to try something new so I boxed dyed my hair black over the henna with no problems! A lot of henna brands have additives so you can't dye over them and this one is just pure henna so I had issues. Amazing quality for the price, and 100% pure henna. I have been using this product to dye my naturally blonde hair a natural red/ginger color. I get loads of compliments on the color! My only complaint is the smell (and the mess) but as it's henna there isn't much to be done about it. I add cinnamon, allspice, etc., making my hair smell more like a gingerbread cookie than a barn. My bf used to hate the smell but since adding the spices he hasn't said a word! Absolutely recommend this product, it's never damaged my hair or anything like a regular dye. Great color.  Lasts a long time.  Perfectly covers a small amount of gray hair.  Hair after use is soft, shiny and full of strength.  Like this brand very much.  I wish the packaging was a little more convenient. The first thing I noticed was that my hair was dry as straw. It felt brittle. I’ve never had my hair feel so awful. I only left it on for one hour. It was really bright but after two weeks finally settled down into a nice natural ginger color that I love. The color has stayed well but after how dry my hair was after I’m afraid to touch up my roots so I will not be continuing with this product. I have dark brown hair and this henna always gives my hair a red tone. I also have sensitive skin & it never irritates my scalp. Highly recommend I have natural auburn hair , so this red henna is perfect for my hair , i have been using this henna for a long time now. Henna is so healthy for your hair . I leave it on for 4 hours , it s very messy to use it but the result is beautiful . I have tried few brands in the past and I would say this is the best one so far.  It creates smoother paste and stains a lot faster.  It actually stained my finger in the matter of few minutes.  I usually leave the henna paste on my hair for about two hours.  This brand I only needed about an hour, perhaps you can do less. The recommend time is 45 mins to 4 hours. I like that it makes my hair soft and manageable.  It's easy to mix and set up.  Since I don't have long, thick hair, I don't need to use the entire package.  Also my hair is black, but it does color the gray strands and I can see the highlights of the henna.",4,5,-1

I'm a big fan of trying new hairstyling tools, but this one has been my go-to for years now. No matter how many new products I try, I always come back to this miracle product. I use it with my Dyson hair dryer and its attachment for taming the wild rebel hairs. I usually apply a small amount at the end of my blowout routine. My hair gets glossy, and frizz-free... a masterpiece! It's lightweight, non-greasy, and colorless, so it doesn't weigh down the hair or leave any residue. As a Latina woman, I struggle of finding the perfect hair product that works for my hair type, but I can say with confidence that this one is the best finalizer I've ever used. No-brainer! I have wavy hair prone to frizziness. I like to straighten it for work to feel more neat and polished. I use this product regularly bc it does the job for the most part, at a very reasonable price point. A very practical product to use for wavy hair in humidity. I purchased this product to help tame fly-aways and frizz on my wigs. And it does just that with a pea size of the product. It doesn’t weigh the hair down either. Smell is nice and subtle. Leave hair soft. I would definitely buy again. Great product I have never found another product that does what this does. Put it on, comb then brush it through and voila, smooth soft and frizz free. I’ve tried serums, other creams, mouse, pomades, etc. this is the best. I have it sent on Amazon’s monthly order. Try it it is so worth it. It smells really good and it tames your frizz very nice. It kinda is crunchy if you put too much in but make sure to brush it after you apply I have tried them all and John Frieda frizz ease creme is better than all those high priced cream's for being able to just rub on my dry hair, for those awful hair frizzy's. I love it!! Not as good as suave which is not available",1,5,-4

It securely holds the different sized curling rods that I use, and keeps them from burning anything. Also, the metal feels very sturdy, and easily stays up right.The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars was because of the base.  I set my straightener on the base the first time I used this, and it almost instantly melted the plastic that covers the bottom, which did not impress me.  I was hoping I could use it for my straightener and my rods, but I can only use it for the rods.  I had to think about whether or not to take a star off for this, since this is for curling irons/rods, and not for straighteners. In the end, decided to give 4 stars, because I think that the base is a flaw in the design.  What if you just absent-mindedly set your curling iron down and it burns the plastic?  That can easily happen! Also, the base is pretty big, and I think any normal person would think it's ok to set something down on it.  I also did not see a warning for the base.  Maybe it was in there, but I did not notice it.That being said, as long as you are using this ONLY for something that fits inside the spiral, this product is perfect, and I would buy it again if I ever lost this one! I've used a curling iron for years and there's always the issue of where to set the hot iron between curls and after I've finished. I have a heat-proof silicone mat which works fine, but takes up a lot of precious counter space and still wouldn't keep it out of the way of a curious cat or child. This holder is the perfect solution and much safer for my home, where there are kids and cats around all the time.It holds the hot iron safely with the handle up - ready to be picked up for the next curl. The base is completely covered in a rubberized material which keeps the holder firmly in place on your counter. The base measures 4"" x 8"".If you use a curling iron or flat iron or know someone who does, you'll probably like this a lot. This is a great addition to my crowded bathroom sink.  It is easy to get the curling iron in and out while I am using it and holds it securely while it cools down.  I have it on a narrow edge of the counter, beside the sink and it moves around a bit, but I think that is because the sink gets in the way.  If I reposition it to a larger area, it is solid.  I have used it with several different sized irons and it works well with most.The one small minus is that it barely fits the 2"" curling iron that I use most often.  Only the very tip with the grip fits in.  Still it has a good hold and the iron has never fallen out of the holder.  I just got the hair dryer holder, which is supposed to hold up to a 3"" diameter appliance.  I think that this will be a better fit for the 2"" iron. I was concerned that the larger curling iron, the 1.5 and the 2"" one, would not work well with this item, but they both did fine with it. They don't fit as far down, but the product is balanced nicely and so it won't tip. The metal coil it sits in does get hot, but the base doesn't even get warm. This was exactly what I was looking for to prevent the cord pulling the curling iron off the counter while I'm sitting there doing my hair in front of the mirror, and it burning my leg or landing on my foot.It's simple construction, doesn't look too bad either, and works really nicely without taking up a huge amount of space on the counter. I'm thinking about getting a similar device for my blow dryer too, and just keeping the items out on the counter instead of putting them away like I've been doing.Definitely a good purchase and I'm quite pleased with the overall quality and functionality of the product. I purchased this hair dryer holder and the matching curling iron holder.  I liked them before I moved, but I love them now that I have moved and the space in my bathroom for my ""necessities"" is smaller than I am used to.  These two items are a life saver to me since they take up little room, are heavy enough never to tip over, and hold my hair dryer and curling iron out of my way and off the limited dresser space.  I especially like the curling iron holder since I never have to worry about burning anything on my dresser, or even if I leave the curling iron on until it automatically cuts off.  It is very convenient when you need to use both hands to get the next lock of hair ready to curl since the iron is held at a very convenient angle for picking up.  I would definitely recommend either or both of these products for space saving, heavy duty convenience, especially if you have limited space to spare for these items. Excellent metal curling iron holder that looks cool and gets the job done. I had been using a plastic flat iron holder to hold my curling iron and once I realized it was melting on the bottom I began searching for a safer and functional alternative. Enter Scalpmaster Curling Iron Holder. I love this and am SO glad I bought it. I love that I never have to worry about my curling iron falling while putting it down, or tipping over the holder. This thing is solid. It will not tip over and can hold up to a 2"" wand. I have even used it to hold my flat iron today because it was more convenient and it worked fine too. Also, I don't know why I was expecting the base to be bigger, but it does not actually take up much room on my counter, which is another plus. I will probably buy another to give to my sister. All around excellent product I can see lasting for a Very long time. This was purchased with a cone-shaped curling iron for my daughter for her birthday. I wasn't too sure she needed it (nor was she...), but it's quickly becoming a favorite hair-care accessory in our home. It's very sturdy and the area where you place the hot barrel of the iron accommodates even larger barreled irons. (We've tried up to a 2"" barrel.)The holder is weighty and stays put on the counter top as the iron is placed in and out of it. It really makes the curling iron easy to grab and protects counters from accidental burns caused by the iron.Definitely recommend this product for its quality and low price!",4,4,0

fl.oz","This product saved my hair..I live in a super humid area and it was impossible to find something that works even among other reputable brands. I gave mixed chicks try and my hair has been so soft but also so defined in curls. I have to put a generous amount but it detangles so nicely and is the right balance between holding my curls and not being leaving that crispy feel on it. Removed 1 star because it leaves hair harder after drying My daughter has curly ringlets and her hair would always get frizzy and tangled up. This has helped tremendously! Love the way this leaves my hair I have thin, fine hair that I crunch. This makes crunching so easy. Hair is soft, but holds. Hair looks fuller. Recommend I have used this product for two years and love the soft curls it creates from my natural curly, often frizzy, hair. I'm half black and half Japanese. My hair is very thick and very thirsty. I used to have it long growing up and would use a home relaxer a lot to try to get some control of the curls. I'd still just air-dry my hair.When I was 25, I let my hair grow out a few inches and then did a big chop to go back to my natural texture and I was happy to find that once I chopped off the old dead hair, I had lovely, springy curls. They are very thirsty though. If I do nothing after a shower, the curls wilt, become very dry, brittle and kinky.  I basically have a short, curly 'fro. In the summer I go very close to my scalp closer to my neck, and in the winter I let it grow out a bit to the point where I part my hair and use bobby pins on each side to flatten the front ""bang"" parts, and let the rest of the curls puff out. My hair is so thick, and as long as I keep it moisturized, it stays shiny, moist and not so kinky.My problem, like most, is having 5 different products to use. And usually one of the products would be to combat a side-effect of one of the other products. For example, for separation of curls, it was usually a curl-defining gel of some sort meant for ""white hair"", which works but probably contained alcohol so I'd need a moisturizer because of the alcohol.This product is basically everything. It moisturizes and defines my curls and is just thick enough to hold, provides shine and does not dry. But how well this product works is also dependent up on your routine and how you style your hair.I wash my hair about every week in the summer, and can go for 2 weeks in the winter. My curls are the best a few days after I've washed it when the product sinks in and my hair is weighed down a little bit more. So, I shampoo my hair/scalp with an organic daily shampoo. I don't condition very often - only in the summer when my hair is the dryest. Here's my strategy:- Wet hair- Shampoo gently- Use a very wide tooth comb to release tangles during rinse(after this I do NOT use anything but my fingers)- I pat VERY gently with towel and squeeze out what I can- apply Mixed Chicks, about a 50 cent piece worth to my hands and rub together- run the product through with my fingers from scalp to ends. I do this all over my head and I do this twice to make sure enough product has coated curls. As I do this, I rub my fingers into my scalp to get some of the product to coat my scalp.- I use about a nickel size once more, rub on my hands and pat/shape curls.That's it. This is where I would pull some to the sides and secure with bobby pins if I want, or just let it air dry. I've dried with a warm air/diffuser, but hair works better for me. My hair pretty much dries in place without too much shrinkage.On the days between washings, I will still wet my hair in the shower, comb through, and air dry. If my hair feels thirsty or is hard to shape with my fingers, I use the nickel size amount. This product is a little pricey, but it has taken me about six months to use a small bottle. I use the most on shampoo days when I've washed the old product out. And again, I only shampoo about every two weeks.I don't recommend this for very fine hair. It may not soak up the product very well and just end up greasy feeling. My thick hair sucks up this product and remains satisfied. I do wish this didn't have so many chemical-ly, un natural sounding products in it. Until I find a more natural or organic solution, I will continue to use this. This makes my wiry frizzy wavy hair in the misty morning, looks much smoother and shinier. And doesn’t make my hair greasy at all.  If I need, I add a tiny bit to my dry hair too.",1,1,0

This works as a mask pretty much. I use it after the shower, let it sit in my hair for a few minutes, and then rinse with cold water. I have definitely noticed my hair is softer. My color is also staying longer this time but that may not be from this. Either way, I will be purchasing this again to keep my hair from drying out ! The only conditioner I use now. I use it to co wash my hair and have no problems with build up. I love that it's sulfate free, and I believe free of anything damaging to my hair or my sensitive skin for that matter. It has a light scent that smells good after my hair dries.This conditioner has consistently been the only thing I know I can use for my dry, damaged hair! I know this, because I have ordered this product regularly for probably almost 2 years. I have long, thick, wavy hair. It can be really hard to manage. I came across this product in a discount store one day and searched for it on amazon when I was almost out. Sure enough, I found it and for a great deal. I have always liked that it comes with a pump, and usually have no problem removing it when I run low and getting the rest of the product out myself. The product is creamy and thick but it's slippery and the same time. I think that's why it coats my hair so well too. I usually put about 4 or 5 pumps in and a bottle lasts me about 6 months. That's a long time for my hair!Since the past time I ordered, there seems to be a new style of pump now. It's even better than the original pump! It dispenses the same amount of conditioner, but it seems much easier to pump. We'll see how it goes when I'm near the end of my bottle. Either way, love this product and hope I can continue to order it on here for a long time! I use this product in my each time I shower. It leaves my hair feeling silky and reduces the fine fly away frizzy hair. My hair is middle of my back length, natural curly & combination fine with medium. I use very little heat products & mostly air dry. I've tried to get away from chemicals in hopes of finding something to help my hair grow back in. Throughout the years I've processed, dyed, highlighted & chemically bleached my hair to the point of it falling out.The shampoo that goes with this masque is great at cleansing. Every night I rub natural oils into my scalp & sleep with them till morning & my hair doesn't feel stripped after using this shampoo & conditioner. My hair actually is soft, shiny & full of body. I love the way this masque smells. To me it is what I imagine a spa would smell like. Earthy, calming, light & sweet.I started out with the little bottles, but am going to order the larger ones in a set because a little for me goes a very long way & I'm guessing the larger bottles will last a few months.When I condition in the shower, I add this in sections. Crown, back, sides, then length. By the time I've worked down to the length my scalp is already moisturized & the ends aren't much to finish. It doesn't feel like there's enough in my hair at first, then by the time I'm done with my shower I can already feel how soft my hair is while rinsing.I'd recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something more natural & gentle on the hair. This is the only product I have found to get rid of tangles in my hair. Everything else knots tangles up & I want to cry looking at the brush afterwards because so much hair came out with brushing. Not with this product. I have been using this product for many years and love it.  It moisturizes my hair even now when I'm starting to get some of those gray hairs. Hard to find the 33oz size so had to settle for th e8oz size. Been using this product for years. Let me start of by saying....I am a African American female with thick, coarse, shoulder lenght hair. Its also permed and colored....This condition works really good and you only have to use a little at a time..usually i have to squeeze like 2/3 times out of a regular store brought shampoo bottle....but no way not with this i dont i would say bout a 1 dime/nickel size would do me good....and it leaves my hair and scalp so clean and it smells fresh for days....i was riding down the road in the car with my sister and when we made it to where we was gng she told me am glad u didnt where no perfume today because your hair smells good and strong but soft...i also use this with DermOrganic shampoo and leave-in....and its perfect for a daily wash or my once a wk wash....Do highly recommand this product to any one...i have using this for a month now...and nothing has gotten worse but better...for me..i looked in my local stores at the time i was comparing prices on Amazon while in Target and CVS Pharmacy in my local area...Amazon prices or a little bit cheaper and reasonable then those two stores....for DermOrganic Argan Oil products...",1,4,-3

The ends of my hair are the definition of overprocessed, with about 2 years of high lift blonde colorings in their history, they were constantly breaking off like snowflakes, and brushing my hair while it was wet was a joke, for fear of my hair simply giving up and all coming out in the brush, because the ends of my hair were literally frayed, creating a mess of tangles. My hair grows extremely slow though, and cutting out the damage was an absolutle last resort, because of the amount of hair that would be taken off, and I literally feared a buzz-cut was in my future. Don't laugh, I actually considered it!UNTIL I found this product.I saw it on Amazon and read some reviews, but couldn't decide if it was worth a try or not, so I waited. So stupid. Then I recieved an Ulta giftcard for my birthday and figured I'd spoil myself and attempt to resurrect my hair, or my only other option was cutting off the last 6-8 inches of terribly damaged hair. I paid $21 dollars for it at Ulta, but after a single use I realized I would have easily paid 3X that, because it was a miracle.My strawlike scarecrow hair had that softness you see only in shampoo commercials, all flowy and smelled terrific, and I was addicted. I cannot go a day without it, after towel drying your hair after a shower, use a nickel sized amount and work it into your ends and then use any excess from your hands on the rest of your hair. I buy another bottle when I'm only halfway through one, simply out of fear of it being out of stock when I run out. Finding it on Amazon at this price was one of the best moments of my life, being completely serious! It doesnt matter if you have even the slightest bit of damage or hair so damaged you are wondering how you would look with a buzz-cut, this product is a hair essential. It gives you shampoo commercial hair! You will not be sorry!I will be using this until the day I die, and I want to be buried with a few hundred bottles just in case Amazon doesn't ship to heaven! haha Bonacure's Sealed Ends leave in conditioner is a product that I hope will be available in the hair products market always.  What the entire Repair Rescue and Moisture Kick lines do for your hair is unbelieveable.  I am a black woman with chemically relaxed hair.  When the products are used on my hair, wet or dry, I can immediately feel the moisture and softness immersed into the strands of my hair.In addition, my daughter's hair benefits tremendously from this product.  We began using the product line as a referral from a sytlist.  It was recommended as a response to my daughter's EXTREMELY dry hair.  I kept her hair in braids due to swimming and her EXTREMELY tender scalp--could not afford to comb it daily due to the discomfort to her.I would notice a lot of shedding as I took her hair down and her ends were so dry and splitting.  I started using the Bonacure lines of Moisture Kick spray I have very curly hair and the humidity has always been such a torture to me that I refused to straighten my hair in the summer time due to my out of control frizz.  This product has been amazing!!! It tames my splits ends and prevents fly aways and frizz from humidity.  There is a HUGE difference with this product vs any other I have tried.  I prefer to wash my hair every 3 days when straightened and this product last in my hair the entire time, does not look greasy or oily, and continues to leave my hair looking and feeling amazing. A little amount goes a long way so this size will last you for a long time.  My hair length is past the mid line of my back and I use a dime size amount every time!!! I have only had this product for one week so the review is fairly premature for any lasting results.  That said, so far so good!! I have been highlighting my hair for many years and have my hair colored/highlighted every 6 weeks like clockwork.  Recently end damage has because noticable with breakage, dry, coarse, and somewhat unmanageable hair mostly on top where the bleach goes.  So I did research and landed on this.. I love it!  I am very cautious and peticular about what I use on my hair and I am excited I found this product.  Ive used it for 4 days in a row and my hair is softer and the damage is already less visable.  I use this in combination with the BC repair cream (not a leave in).  I am positive with continued use this will only have great results! A must have for anyone that lightens their hair!",1,2,-1

The primrose scent smells exactly the same to me and is $12 cheaper.You only need to use a very small amount so a bottle lasts about as long as a larger/cheaper brand product. I'm a big fan of the John Masters line, but this shampoo is not one of my favorites. The smell is very herbal, but in a slightly medicinal way. It creates a nice lather in the shower, though it felt a bit stripping (while wet). That being said - after I used this (in combination with the John Masters lavender avocado conditioner / apricot hair milk) - my hair *did* look quite nice ! I've used this product for YEARS and love it!  Super healthy and nice hair, and with a nontoxic product!If you have harsh water, chlorinated or heavily chlorinated  water etc this might not be enough to wash away all the oil that your body has generated to compensate for the loss of oil due to the harsh water.  The same can be said of using stronger/harsher shampoo.  Your body will compensate for the loss of oil, and this will not be enough to wash away that oil.When you first start to use it, your skin will need to adjust to not creating so much oil, and you'll need to use it for a few days before your hair stops being too oily.  During this transition, you can wash your hair more frequently, and then back off as your body adjusts.The only frustrating thing is that it does not suds up (I think this is partly the reason it is not too harsh) and doesn't easily get below the surface of my hair to my scalp.  I've thought I could use a bottle with a spout (similar to the perm bottles or the old restaurant ketchup bottles) so that I can apply it directly to my scalp, but haven't tried this.  For now, I just use a bit more shampoo, and spend a bit more time working into my hair. :)Would not go with any other product! I gave this product 3 stars because it smells really good and it is pretty natural but I disliked that it made my hair feel sticky and drier than before. I had to use a lot of it to feel like it was working and after a month, i didn't see any improvement in my dry hair :( won't buy again I've used this almost exclusively for years and it works great for my delicate, thin hair. I also like their detangler and deep conditioner. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't find these products, because I don't even have a second choice. I used to use only unscented products which tend to be a bit utilitarian, and also hard to find. Yet I can tolerate whatever John Masters uses for fragrances, which I believe to be natural plant extracts, but I can't read the tiny print on the bottle even with my glasses. As an added plus, this shampoo does not wash out the natural henna hair color I use, (which is the Rainbow Research brand, the best product of its kind I have found). I mean, henna and other botanical dyes do wash out of your hair slowly even if you use just water, but it is nice when your shampoo doesn't effect it any more than necessary. John Masters is as gentle on my hair and my henna dye as anything I have found. No seal on the bottle, shampoo was very thin and dark brown. No lather. Made me itch. I’m wondering if the bottle I received was tampered with because it doesn’t seem anything like the sample I’d used leading up to making this purchase. Nice relaxing, herbal, gender neutral smell.  Usually I prefer a scentless shampoo because I don't enjoy perfume smells but I've been using this for weeks now and have developed no aversion to the smell.  At any rate the scent really does not linger in my hair, but I wouldn't mind if it did.I don't need a big bottle as I only wash my hair every 3-4 days, so it lasts me a while.  I use it w/the citrus neroli conditioner (can also be used as a leave in) and the rose and apricot leave in cream conditioner.  I have no problems with dryness and have only seen improvements to shine and the strength of my hair.  I have fine,long hair and only shampoo my scalp and deeply condition only the ends of my hair...that may be why I haven't experienced dryness.  It completely cleans without stripping my hair.  I have noticed no buildup of any kind. I have been using this for many years. Love everything about it! Hair and scalp feels healthy.",1,3,-2

conditioner I love putting in my wigs! it keeps it soft, refreshed and smelling good. I don't use anything else This product line is fantastic. I discovered it on YouTube videos on""How to revitalize a synthetic wig."" As they describe how well it works to soften, smooth the fibers, smells great, & brings even the most hopeless wigs 'back from the dead,' Ithought I would give it a try for my collection of natty wigs.My thought was also that if it can perform miracles on wigs, what could it do for my C4 natural hair that has always been a problem...dry brittle, thick but weak strands that break like a stick, so course and tight to my head! I'm not exaggerating! Relaxers will loosen it a bit, temporarily but the effects don't last & it quickly reverts back!I did some research and found that Silicon Mix is a Dominican product that has been around for years! The product line actually contains keratin, that's known to rebuild and strength the hair like mine!I found a great price on Amazon I had nothing to lose. It would help my sad wigs. That was clear from the videos. So best case scenario would be to try it on my hair as well and it will work for both!Yay! The best case was made! It's resurrected my old wigs, to look like new and smell so lovely! I was so excited to see what it would do for my hopeless ""nappy"" hair. IT'S MADE MY HAIR JUST AS THE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMED!I am really amazed and so pleased! Over the years I have tried everything and nothing has really worked. I pretty much gave up and focused on wearing wigs!I have waited to write a review, to give it time to see how long it will last and to be able to give it an honest and complete review.1.) Affordable 2.) Super easy to use. Wash hair put it in and wait a few minutes rinse and ta-da!!! 3) Multiple uses.The first time I tried it I left it in for maybe 5 to 10 minutes. I felt like I had just used a relaxer! My hair is soft, actually stronger, AND shiny! I'm not getting anything from the company, so my experience is sincere!I have actually put a relaxer in again to loosen it up and straighten it... I was nervous to see if that would ruin it or something. After doing that, I put the Silicon Mix in hoping to deep condition and protect it from damage, I kept it in for 30 to 45 minutes.Great Gatsby!!! My hair was like I had gone to the salon! So again I waited to see if the results would keep before fallen completely for it! I'm in love and I have since purchased the full line package, including also the shampoo leave in conditioner and the gloss!Yes, I married it and thehoneymoon is going strong and long! I have also colored my hair and for the first time I can remember, I am happy with my natural hair... it's strong and healthy! I'm committed!This is my experience and it has performed a miracle for me and my ridiculously difficult hair. It's been well over a month, and... WOW!I hope you give it a try and it works for you!😊 Muy bueno Love what I’ve been hearing about to product!! Does exactly what it need to do for moisture and shine , I use this every time I wash my bundles or wigs. The smell is like a custodian cleaner supplies. Overall 10/10!! Acabo de recibir el producto no se si me atreva a probarlo el olor es fatal como perfume intenso de abuelita! Cambien el olor en su fórmula!!!! Mi cabello está más sedoso y compacto ,me gusta el cambio . Made my hair feel like silk Overall I love this product but the smell is really absolutely horrible. My mom can't use it due to the smell being so overwhelming but I had to explain to her once you rinse it out of the wig the hair smells more like real hair after a shower. This hack has been going around in the wig community to restore any type of wig and I do admit I am hooked! It kinda makes the wig like new!! I say kinda because some well loved and well worn heat friendly synthetics just need to be straightened and Restyled. However for human hair and even for regular synthetics that you cannot straighten this works wonders.  You wash the wig as usual. Then rinse it and while it's wet, apply this as a conditioner or hair mask. You then just leave it in your empty sink overnight. You can also put it in a baggie if you wish. Next morning you rinse the product out and comb thru and let it air dry. If your wig is curly it helps to hold upside down, use wide tooth comb to detangle, then put on a hair net and hang it dry upside down to dry all day. When you take your wig out no joke it is almost like new!! It's truly incredible!!! The pic shows me in an older heat friendly synthetic wig that I treated and it looks this good without even restraightening or anything! I'll be using this to treat all my luxury wigs from now on!!!! I have a full head of hair, it's just boring. I love wearing glam extra hair, why not!!",5,5,0

I finally figured it out, since I have thin hair, the denmen could not get a grip (tension) on my hair.  This brush is great for my hair and I love the outcome.  Much quicker than finger coiling. So firstly let me start off with a little on myself. I'm 18, female, and big chopped my hair for the second time in a year. My hair is 3b/3c and I haven't washed my hair with anything other than conditioner in around 3 months. I ordered this brush despite some of the negative reviews because I'm trying to transition to a water only / sebum only hair care routine. Yesterday on 9/11/15 --my heart goes out to the families who lost a loved one on that horrific day, 14 years ago-- I received the brush 3 days earlier than expected which really got me so excited since it was part of a birthday gift I bought for myself. The brush didn't come wrapped in anything besides the bubble wrap delivery envelope which isn't a big deal in my opinion. I immediately inspected the bristles to make sure they aren't nylon. I clipped one off and held it with tweezers and burned it. It smelled like burnt hair so I am assuming it to be boar hair. I had a pure boar bristle brush when I was a kid and had it for 9 years before I broke it. I read a lot of the reviews and people were complaining about the gloss coming off. In my opinion I don't think it's a big deal , eventually all the gloss will come off and it will look uniform again the only down side is it will be dull :( oh well. Also a lot of people were complaining of the brush comeing missing a single complete bundle of boar hair and the nylon bristle however, I'm pretty sure that they might have not realized that is just the vent hole for the brush so the rubber can collapse and uncollapse as you brush your hair (so the bristles can confirm to your head better.Another comment on the flaking gloss, maybe it could be caused by using the brush in the shower? I think it would be a bad ide because of that reason and eventually the glue holding the rubber in place could possibly lose its hold and would eventually lead to it being ripped out (this has happened to me before with other brushes). Plus the brush might get moldy inside where the vent hole is (yuck!)Side note: the brush is smaller than expected... I didn't bother to try and process the demension pics included so whatever. Other than that it looks like it does in the pics besides the whole made in Germany thing... Maybe they changed the writing on the brush because technically it's not a 100% boar hair brush... Each bundle has a single nylon bristle.I'll be updating my experiences with the brush in maybe a week or two...Update:The brush word good at distributing natural hair oils and coconut oil. I've had it for almost 2 weeks and there has been NO loss to the brushes finish. I NEVER use it on wet hair nor do I use it in the shower. Also I don't store it in my hot steamy bathroom. So I think if you don't do that stuff either you won't have a problem concerning the finish.Once a week I clean the brush like this:1. I remove any hairs caught in the brush.2. I use a dry toothbrush to brush out dandruff from that have been caught in the bristles3. Then I wet the tooth brush with hot water and brush the comb the bristles to remove any left over dandruff. (Constantly rinsing the toothbrush)4. I mix warm water and a dollop of shampoo5. I dip the tooth brush in the water and combed the bristles to remove excess oil.6. Rinse with cool water7. Repeat steps 5 and 6. (Optional)8. Quickly dry the wood off getting the rim of the brush too.9. Lay the brush upside bristle side down on a rag in a well ventilated area over night. (Will include a pic)I will write one more update at the one month mark and again whenever the brush starts peeling.Update 10/9/15It will be a month of owning this brush in 2 days. It lost one bundle but I was able to put it back. It hasn't come out since. This brush works well in my hair and in my step sister's hair (unlike my hair, hers is thin and naturally straight). There has still been no peeling. I personally am choosing to no clean it with a wet tooth brush so often. I'll be cleaning it dry as best I can because I think maybe cleaning it so often made the bristles come loose. October 2013: The ""extra gentle"" boar-bristle-with-nylon air-pillow brush is holding up (this is the one with the plastic handle in stead of the wood), that is, the bristles aren't sinking in.  (I can't comment on the life span of the replacement wooden one they sent, since I haven't been using it.)  The plastic handled one still tears my greying hair if I'm not careful, but not as much.  Overall, it was a bit of a hassle, but I did appreciate how the company handled the problem.April 2013: Contacted the company, with my receipt and pictures, requesting my money back.  They did not refund me, but they did respond promptly, saying they had never been contacted about this problem before, and offered to send me a replacement brush for free.  In the end they sent me an extra free brush as well--slightly different style (plastic base instead of wooden)--maybe they thought it would be more appropriate for my hair type and not tear as much? It was listed as ""extra gentle"".  We'll see how it holds up.March 2013:  The brush is now completely flat, with the central rings of bristles being super short or missing altogether (I got tired of constantly trying to pull them back up).  Consequently the brush catches and tears my hair instead of detangling it--I now, unintentionally, have bangs, which I didn't want.  If I can figure out how to upload pictures, I will.9-18-12 (original review date, but I accidentally put the review on their mini-brush I also bought, instead of here): On the plus side, I love how this brush feels on my head.  It's one of few brushes that successfully gets through my wavey, tangle-prone hair.  And it does so without creating static. (It does pull the wave out though--'wish it didn't.)On the down side, it's a little larger than my last brush--unnecessarily so, and to me a little too heavy.  The bigger issue though is that apparently there is nothing holding the bristles in place, so their much touted ""pneumatic"" feature (air ""pillow"" under the pink bristle pad) is just a hole that the bristles slowly sink into.  If I work at it, I can grab a hold of individual tufts and pull them back up, but of course they don't all come up evenly, and some of the individual bristles get accidentally pulled out, so doing that regularly--apart from the fact that I shouldn't have to--will significantly shorten the life-span of the brush.  We'll see how long this brush actually stays functional.  I've only had it a few months at this point.Also, there's an empty bristle tuft hole in each brush.  I worry that when I wash my brush (which I do every time I wash my hair) there is water getting in there which won't dry easily, and will eventually either rot out the brush or create a mold problem. Just speculation, but of concern.Next time I think I'll pay a bit more and get the other brand. I had one of those for years before it started breaking down.",3,5,-2

little one decided might great idea came crazy good product genuinely good company,"Dr. Bronner's - Organic Hair Crème (Lavender Coconut, 6 Ounce) - Leave-In Conditioner and Styling Cream, Made with Organic Oils, Hair Cream Supports Shine and Strength, Nourishes Scalp, Non-GMO","Works pretty good. Made with decent natural ingredients. Smells not too strong. A light nice scent of lavender. I'm not a big fan of lavender, but it's really not bad at all & made of stuff that I'd put on my hair. There's 2 scents. Mint & lavender. Would be nice to have other scents... I use very little for my son with loose curls, maybe a 2c. My other son is closer to maybe a 3c and soaks this stuff up like a sponge. I use a dime size for one child, a palm-full for the other, and he has barely any hair yet. It smells fine, a strong scent that lasts. I like that it is organic but it is definitely not for all hair types. I thought I was ordering shampoo, and it is conditioner… 🍯 I have shoulder length slightly wavy, very fine hair-- and a lot of it. And although I have a lot of hair, my biggest problem is flat hair because it is so fine. I've spent a lot of money on products to help increase volume, but I really hadn't found anything that worked all day.A friend was telling me about all the bad things in regular shampoo, so I decided to switch to all natural products. I did some research and decided to initially try the home made stuff--- water, castile soap, and essential oils = shampoo and diluted apple cider vinegar for the conditioner. I'll say the conditioner was better than the shampoo, but it wasn't really doing it for me so I decided to switch again. I tried a combo of three products: JR Liggett's bar shampoo, Dr. Bonners citrus conditioner rinse, and Dr. Bonner's Lavender and coconut conditioner and styling creme.They all came at different times (only days apart), but I got to try the Lavender and Coconut hair creme first with my homemade products. I used just a tiny drop, but it really did make a huge difference in the smoothness and softness of my hair. It also has a pleasant, but not over powering smell. I really didn't see any difference in the volume of my hair thoughNext came the bar shampoo-- big improvement over the handmade shampoo and in combination with the dr. bonner hair creme my hair was even softer. The bar shampoo says it can be used without any other products-- eh. I tried it without the conditioning products, but it isn't something I'd do again. My hair wasn't stringy but it had a very strange texture-- not very soft. Still not a lot of increase in volume.Next came the Dr. Bonner Citrus Rinse. Awesome. The combination of all three products definitely seems to be the winner. It is important to use all the products according to the package instructions or your hair may not be exactly what you want it to be, but when it's used properly-- great results. My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that. No more problems with oily hair and I haven't had any dandruff. As for volume, I have seen an improvement. I even wore my hair in a ponytail for work, wore it up all day, and then took it down when I went to sleep. When I woke up-- volume! That has never, ever, ever happened before.It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn't as smooth and soft as before. It wasn't a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable to me.Also, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very indescribable way. It isn't bad at all, but it is a little different. I think it feels healthier, thicker and I'm just not used to it. I think reviews involving personal care products need to remind readers everyone has a different body chemistry and what might work for one may not for another.I've always had skin sensitivities to shampoo, conditioners, soap, etc, since I was an infant. However, about 10 years ago, it blossomed into a full blown allergy. Then about 3 years ago, I also developed an allergy to any products (not just personal care products) which contained perfumes of any kind.My sister brought me a bottle of Dr. Bronner's baby soap to try, having been told it could be used on my hair as well. It worked exceptionally well, but left my hair feeling unpleasant in a number of ways.Eventually, I bought ""Dr. Bonner's Organic Hair Creme - Peppermint"" (this product) and ""Dr. Bonner's Hair Conditioner Rinse - Citrus"".After reading a lot of reviews for both products, I carefully followed the instructions and have found both products do exactly as promised, leaving my hair manageable and clean. If anything, I think my scalp has even improved in that I no longer see as much flaking. (And for those interested, I've tried every conceivable product designed for scalp itchiness, flakiness, etc. -- none had any effect and most made the problem worse.)I will admit, I was loath to spend more money on a product which didn't state it was scent free. However, these scents don't appear to be artificial and peppermint (the hair creme) and citrus (rinse) not only don't bother me, they even have a nice scent. If I were to guess, though, the scent doesn't last long, since none of my grand daughters (who live with us) generally are sensitive to odors because of their concern about my allergies.The basic instructions are to:1) wash your hair and rinse with water;2) mix 1 capful of the hair rinse with 8 oz water and pour slowly over your hair to remove your soap/shampoo;3) towel dry and add hair creme.My steps are a bit more, only because I like to wash my hair twice. (It's a baby boomer thing, folks.)1) wash my hair with a glycerin soap;2) wash my hair with Dr. Bonner's baby soap; rinse with water, squeeze out water;3) rinse my hair with diluted (see above) Dr. Bonner's hair rinse;4) gently towel dry;5) using a very, very small amount of hair creme spread across my palms, I gently rub it into a section of hair and repeat for each section. I then use a comb to help evenly disperse the creme.My only complaint: hair cleaning now takes me considerably longer than it did before ... 10 minutes vs 1-2 minutes. It absorbs into your hair quickly leaving it moisturized without a greasy feeling. It does not build up or cake up leaving flakes If you have really dry hair I suggest you look for a deeper conditioner. I'm talking like oil or over night because of sun or hair dye damage. This works wonderfully for styling. My buzzcut is growing and this isn't so heavy that it looks greasy and it helps style it a little.",5,4,1

find complain overall product would recommend,"Desert Essence, Thickening Shampoo, Green Apple and Ginger, 8 oz","Great shampoo doesn’t dry your hair This smells wonderful in the shower without lingering afterwords. It cleans very well but it can be drying (I liked the same brand conditioner). But I would say the thickening part of the marketing is inaccurate. If anything, my hair seems thinner than before I started using it. Which is probably because the thickening product I previously used actually worked for that. Bottom line; if you’re just looking for a natural shampoo to clean your hair this will be fine. Having developed contact dermatitis on my scalp to shampoos, including the very expensive sulfate free type, I have been looking for an alternative. I read a few reviews here that complained about this shampoo leaving their hair oily. I am sorry for them but I'm glad I got this anyway (being desperate will make you take a chance) thankfully I did not have that problem. And you might not either.  Also, my hair is colored so I did not want to try the ""no-poo"" shampoo, as I am afraid that would strip the color from my hair. I am 52 and my hair has always been thick. I have super dry skin and have always had an allergy to nickle in jewelry, so I'm not surprised that I have developed an allergy to shampoo. I received this product yesterday and shampooed my hair, The last time I shampooed my hair was about 2 weeks ago (I used only cream rinse in the interim) so my hair was slightly greasy. After using this product my hair is clean and bouncy. It is slightly frizzy but I'm used to that as all shampoos have left my hair frizzy.  I did not get the cream rinse as I am still using the stuff I have. When I run out of that I'll probably get the Desert Essence cream rinse. This is one of my favorites, it smells like apples and thickens wonderfully for baby fine hair!!!! this is my husband's favorite shampoo. He always requests I get the shampoo I love the smell of the green apple it cleans his hair really thoroughly. while I love the smell of the shampoo I tend to have dryer hair and I find the shampoo does not work so well for me I prefer the coconut smelling shampoo that has more moisturizers in it. My husband's scalp tends to get a little greasy and with his work floor sanding this just does a great job cleaning his hair and he really loves the smell so if it ain't broke don't fix it. I have oily, thin, shoulder length hair, and I love this product. It doesn't weight my hair down or make it super dry. I do use a tiny dot of conditioner at the ends and sides to keep fly-aways at bay. The smell is also really good and not too strong. I've actually gone a few times without washing my hair for a day, and my hair is still manageable and not too greasy. I'm on my second bottle now, and the first one probably lasted almost 2 months. Great product and definitely recommend for my hair type. Smells great & leaves my very damaged hair (bleached to death) completely soft & manageable. Buy it! This shampoo was not what I was hoping for. The smell is nice but it I made my hair stringy & weird. Doesn’t feel clean.",4,4,0

closet,"Conair Mega Self Holding Rollers, Pink, 9 Count","I like these curlers for doing more intricate vintage hairstyles with an overnight dry set.For a basic vintage dry set I prefer using a set of foam and wire silky cloth rollers that I also bought on Amazon.I bought these originally from Amazon but they came damaged so I purchased the same set elsewhere for more money because shipping was not included.🤷🏽‍♀️Oh well 😔  Lets get on to the review shall we?I have long very thick hair and bangs plus I don’t use heat on my hair, but I love to rock vintage hairstyles.Since it’s kinda hard to get the right kind of vintage curl if you don’t use heat and have long hair especially if you have African American hair and want your edges to be smooth *** I have 3c edges and the rest is 2b/c ***, I’m gonna give you an example of how I use these to create vintage styles like the one in the picture.There are a ton of ways to do this style, this is just how I have to do it for my hair type.🤓As I primarily sleep in my curlers, I usually only do the front with these particular curlers because sleeping in regular foam rollers is uncomfortable.I prefer to use the foam and wire rollers  for the back  because they are like sleeping on mini pillows. These foam ones were absolute murder in the back to sleep in for me and I’ve been sleeping in rollers, even the hard plastic variety!!!!!, for 20 years.If I am doing a day set and not sleeping in them, I use the entire color variety of curlers which is what I did for the hair in the picture.How I used these:I begin with my normal side part.Then I part my hair with a rat tail comb starting from the tip of one ear over to the tip of the other ear.I clip the rest with a claw clip so it’s out of the way.I take the less hair heavy section and clip it so it’s out of the way as well, then I take the heavier hair section and start to part it.I slightly dampen the parted sections with a curl cream, then starting from the top of my head, I take the first section of hair from the middle of the section and place it on top of the open blue curler.Then I place a finger on top of the hair that’s directly on the roller ***to keep it steady and the curl smooth ***and use my other hand to wrap the bottom part of my hair around the curler in an over under motion to the end.You can generally remove your finger once you have  wrapped it the first time.It usually takes about 6-8 winds around the curler to get the bottom part of my curl all wrapped up.I then grip both ends of the curler so that the hair stays on and is smooth and continue to roll the hair up to my scalp making sure to pull taught so all my crinkly edges get in there, taking care to ensure the curl tip is smooth and tucked into the roller when finished, then snap the curl bar down.The first curl is rolled with the hair over the curler from the middle in an over under motion and the next with the hair wrapped in an under over motion till you reach the scalp.Continue rolling the curls like this until you reach the end.It’s important to figure out how many pieces to section off so that the last curler is rolled in an under over motion towards your scalp.I had 4 sections, but if I want it to be even more elaborate, I have 6.Repeat on the other side.For the remaining hair in the back, I part it down the middle and roll each separate side from the top down. I do it this way  because it’s easier to sleep in them for me and it’s become a habit even when I’m not sleeping in em, but you can section your hair all the way across your head in the more traditional manner if you prefer.I clip off one side with the claw clip and start sectioning the other side of my hair from the top.I use the large pink ones for the top 2 rows for volume ***rolled with the hair over***, the green for the following 2 rows and the yellow for the last 1-3 rows *** all but the first two rows are rolled with the hair  in an under over motion around the roller till you reach your scalp***Repeat on the other side.My hair doesn’t like to hold a curl at the bottom but using the second to smallest roller in this set helps alleviate the problem.I cover my hair with either a head scarf or silk bonnet to keep the curls smooth and use a steam cap for 20-30 mins to set the curls if I’m doing a dry set.I also cover my hair when sleeping in the set to prevent breakage and to keep the curls smooth.If doing a dry set and not sleeping in the rollers,because I have a massive amounts of hair, it can take 4-6 hours for the hair to set.The steam cap is CRUCIAL to making sure the curls hold and your edges are steamed so they are smooth. I don’t want to tease you with partial knowledge, so since I described how to use the rollers to get the hair in the picture, I might as well finish you off and tell you how I created my curled results.🤓I take the back out first, finger comb the curls then twist  one side into a tight high bun and repeat on the other  side.  If you want less volume, make the buns low.The buns have to be tight at the crown so that your edges are smooth when you take off your steam cap.Put on a steam cap for 10-20 mins and leave your hair in the buns after taking off the cap.Then take out the front. I take out the heavier side of my hair first, style it, then do the other side so I can blend them together easily and I don’t have a mass of hair to deal with all at once.I don’t comb the curls, I wind each curl around my finger and pin all the individual curls from the back so the pins don’t show,  to my head  with the little curled “o” facing forward.  Do this for all the curls except the last curl at the bottom***the one you curled towards your head*** .I tease the last curl bottom starting at the base of my scalp up to about half the hair length, then I smooth the outside with the teasing brush, curl the curl around  my finger towards my head and pin the curl up and behind the curl mass I previously created, with the curl o  facing front.You may need to randomly put some more pins in the curl mass to secure it.I don’t have to use a smoothing cream for any flyaways or hairspray to set everything any longer due to my new hair care regime, but don’t be afraid to use either if the hair isn’t looking as polished as you’d like it to and to make sure the curls don’t fall.I love this hair style because I can put the back in ponytails when it’s hot, wear it with the back down and free flowing or put the back up in a chignon to make it extra fancy.🥳The other cool thing about this style is if you wear a silk bonnet to bed and twist up the back in a bun to sleep, you can keep the style fresh  and looking fabulous for up to 4 days!These curlers give the best set for this type of style because the curl lasts for days.🥰I think this is a great set for the price and I’m super glad I bought them, I just wish the ones that had come from Amazon were not damaged.🤷🏽‍♀️  I love these rollers! I have very thick hair and am able to bear quickly roll my hair and whereas with your old phone rollers, it was a pain. I I love these rollers because they they bend and keep my hair secured. I have slept in them and they’re very comfortable because I’m a take care I don’t roll my hair until dry. I let my hair air dry and roll my hair up really quickly And keep in while I’m doing my make up etc. and leave in about 30 minutes and I have gorgeous waves that look like I spent a lot of time and rolling with hot tools.  I haven’t had any problem with the wire inside sliding out. I bought these to give me that bouncy look and that was achieved.  I bought a smaller size for the crown of my head for a tighter curl.  They open and close nicely and the price was good.P.S.  On the day I received the package with these in it, we were at the end of a thunderstorm, and it was still raining very hard.  The Amazon driver put my package against the door to keep it from being soaked and then he rang the bell to let me know it was there.  It's the little courtesies that brings the biggest smiles.  Thank you so much. These worked like a charm! Definitely recommended as a way to protect your hair from using heat on it. I slept in these with my dry thin short hair and woke up to nice rolls! I also sprayed some anti-frizz just so they can look good once I take the rolls out! These stick on very well and are sorted good! I wish that the packaging was a bit more sturdy, it seems a bit cheaply made. The rollers themselves hold up pretty well and won't move at all, especially when you use bobby pins/clips. Usually places like cvs mark them up a couple of dollars but these were way cheaper and the same brand.  Good for the price!",5,4,1

They're super flexible and easy to manipulate, but at the same time they have a really great hold. I've never had an issue of them drooping or falling out.I have very long and thick hair and I wasn't sure how well these would hold and I was pleasantly surprised, actually that's not true, I was blown away by the flexibility and how lightweight they are.  I personally don't sleep in them, but I think they would be fairly comfortable to do so.  Don't sleep on these curlers, they're great, and really affordable.  Win win. Love the Conair curlers. I have a larger rod size purchased prior to this that I love. This smaller rod size doesn't seem to be as good as the larger ones, as i try to keep my rods flat/ straight, so I reshape them to the original rod shape when i am finished to keep their life span healthier, or  hope, but.. these, don't seem to be as easy to straighten back out. It's like the wire inside is not as flexible or something. The curl it puts out though is awesome!! Example: I put 2 in my bangs and shorter hairs around my face and used my larger ones for my 'long mop of hair'. I rolled them up with a little hair glue and warm water, and just lightly worked my fingers through my hair to add some moisture and a bit of glue to various spots... Left the rods in for abot 45 min? while I got ready for work, then took them out, and the smaller rods left such a bouncy curl I may have to roll my entire head in the small ones to see how that looks! WOOT! NO HEAT curling, how can you go wrong? I had been on a YouTube video binge and saw a young lady use these, and recommend them... And this product is awesome if you know how to use it, also less time consuming and no damaging your hair. Win win win!What I usually tend to do is jump out of the shower, brush my hair and do my normal routine and pop these in.  I shower at night 90% of the time, so I just wear them under my headset while I'm gaming and then go to sleep in them. (Not always too comfortable, but you can work around it!)I also recommend putting in a little moose or whatever product you're use too when  you do this. I also wrap them around very tightly, right up too the roots to where they basically just sit on top of my head. This gets my hair SO curly, like Shirley Temple.. that stays in all day! I even still have curls for the next few days afterwards.I have very thick hair, and a lot of it.. when it was a bit shorter I could get away with one pack.. but now that I'm letting it grow out I'm glad I ordered two.You can easily find videos of people using these on YouTube if you're not sure how to roll your hair in them - My hair isn't super long so I haven't tried to use them for big, long, bouncy curls... but as I said. They are great for super curly, Shirley temple. Okay, so I have long (little longer than my shoulder blades), wavy, thick hair. I usually straighten or braid it because it is a bit frizzy. I really wanted a new look without damage so I got these. They work....maybe even too well! I only ordered one pack and I plan on getting another (one pack is not enough for my hair). If your hair is similar to mine I suggested you do NOT pull these all the way to the root. Also some people said they work better if you put them in after a shower. Again, if you have hair similar to mine do NOT  do this. Your hair will look like a poodles behind. Put the curlers in on dry hair and then lightly spray water all over and when dry take them out and style.Overall these work well its just a matter of finding the best way to put them in and make them work for you. I love these things. I am a low maintenance girl, I do not like standing at the mirror during a hot summer with a hot curling iron in the smoldering heat. They are a little uncomfortable to sleep on, but if you're able to wrap your head with a thick scarf, the thickness of the scarf will add cushion like a pillow, making it a bit more comfortable. I have long, medium thick hair.. I use the rollers on day-old washed hair, dry, and I dampen the strands with either a spritz of water or leave-in conditioner, then sleep on them. The curls are springy and tight when you first take the foam rollers out.. I usually separate the curls with my fingers then take my curling wand and ""fix"" any of the ends that did not turn out right. I then apply a SMALL amount of mousse for curly hair. (adding too much mousse will weigh the curls right out) after the mousse dries and sets the hair, I comb the ends to give it a more polished look. There are plenty of YouTube tutorials on how to use these rollers, they have helped me out a lot. They are a perfect size for my hair.  Radius 1 1/2"", Length 8"", Diameter 1/2"".  My hair is in layers about 5"" long all over.  I can do sections and roll them in a spiral from top of head to neck or use it to roll a single layer.  It makes a tight curl on the curler and generally holds very well.  After the hair dries the curl is well formed but soft.  On longer hair I am certain it would create beautiful spirals.  I wonder about the rod or center which makes the roller flexible.  I don't know how durable it will be with daily use, but I don't need all the curlers, so I will be able to use a few at a time and toss as they wear.  I would buy again. I have thick, mostly straight hair and the non heat curling methods I've tried either don't work very well or take too long, but this is definitley the fastest, easiest method I've found and I'm really happy with the end result! I can do my whole head in 15-20 minutes, then I just sleep with them overnight and in the morning I have curls. The longer you keep the rollers in, the better the curls look (obviously,) but I tried having the rollers in for about an hour and blow drying them for 5 minutes, and that worked pretty well too. The curls didn't stay in quite as long, but it still looked good for most of the day. I will be using these a lot!",3,5,-2

extremely short hair; balding and thin.  I'm using a hairy thickening shampoo, and this fiber hair wax/pomade.  Went in easily; really made my hair look a little thicker (more coverage).  As another reviewer stated, it didn't last a long time, just sort of evaporated.On the plus side, it came with 4 small jars of other types of Crew hairy waxes and creams; totally unexpected!  I still can't find it listed in product description.  Overall, I'm pleased with this brand, and look forward to using my samples! I loved that they included a couple extra samples of other hair cream, didn’t expect that but I’m definitely satisfied 😀 My fiancé has somewhat short hair and this stuff is just enough to keep his hair styled all day and doesn’t feel like gel! I've been using this product for almost a year. I love how it holds the hair with such a strong hold together with an unrecognizable shine unlike regular hair gel, great product! Used Crew product for the first time today worked fantastic very windy day hair did not moveVery happy We love your product and appreciate the free samples! They smell amazing and help to style my husband and sons hair! I bought the 'gravity paste' from another company and hated how sticky/dirty it made my hair feel.  This product is light and yet has a decent amount of hold. Your hair doesn't look like it has gloss in it.",3,4,-1

Also, it does not make my hair greasy looking, though I apply a huge amount. (I buy the full sized container at Target when there is a deal or through Swanson Vitamins at just $5.99 for 8.5 oz.) I accidentally discovered that this conditioner makes a better styling product for curly hair than anything else I can find, including toxic products. I do not use any other conditioner or styling gel, though I will reapply in windy conditions to tame frizziness. (As I age, my hair has more natural frizz. I'm 55.) Hair products get on pillow cases. We breathe them all day, then smoosh them into our pillow cases at night. I used to have sinus problems caused by styling products, but have used this for years with no problems at all. It's rating on EWG's (Environmental Working Group's) site is just a 2, so I don't have to worry about it affecting my hormones either. My hair is thick & curly, so I pin parts of it up & apply this conditioner heavily to one section at a time. Placed on a child's hair after washing, it eliminates tangles, conditions, & serves as a setting gel. Great time saver for curly headed people. Maybe there was just something wrong with the bottle I received?  Someone who has been using this can probably confirm or deny this, but I got a 2oz bottle to try this direct leave in conditioner.  I love Giovanni products.  I usually use the smooth as silk conditioner (that has a slightly sweet-candy-like smell that fades quickly as your hair dries) but I put that on and leave it on for about 10 minutes before rinsing.  I got this leave-in thinking it would be better for traveling (not taking up as much bathroom time when the bathroom has to be shared with multiple people) just a simple apply after shampoo and leave it, but as soon as I opened it there was a VERY strong car-engine smell like a hot engine running and inhaling the oil or gasoline type fumes.  I thought perhaps it was the bottle--maybe heated up in travel to hot Florida, but when I applied it to my hair the smell was worse.  I don't even know if it's good for my hair or not because I had to re-shampoo and condition with my regular conditioner to get the smell out. Anyone else had a similar experience? This bottle is small. I wasn't prepared for how small it is, but it's great because I wanted to sample the product first before buying a full bottle. I don't know about you guys, but I'm sick of all the barely used or half used bottles of hair products lying around in the back of my storage closet. I digress. But I loved it.This product is lightweight, but not runny liquid. Great leave in for natural hair fashionistas. I'm going to order a full size one now. I have very dry natural African American hair  and I saw many Youtube reviews on this product so I said what the heck I'll give it a try. Well I washed my hair ,let it air dry 50% then I applied a small amount of the product and did a twist out on my hair. The next morning my hair was soo soft no frizz and just the best it has ever looked since I became a natural. So all your natural hair gals need to jump on the Giovanni band wagon. p.s. alittle goes a long way!! I really like this product but was surprised that it was so little. For my type of hair: thick, course, and curly, it definitely did it’s best. This thing packs some powerful punches. It left my hair feeling softer than ever before! Saw this product on YouTube. It's used by a lot of natural's. I did like it but was surprised at how small the bottle is. Mite as well spend the extra money and get a full size... I have 3c/4a hair and this leave in make my hair soft when wet, then it makes it dry. I seal with evoo. I'm on a no silicone regimen right now. I noticed that my hair was more moisturized when I used silicone conditioners.",3,2,1

for most of her life, with scaly itchy lesions that she would scratch to the point of bleeding. I've tried all baby shampoos on the market (Johnson and Johnson, Aveeno, California Baby, Mustela) and none helped.A few months ago I discovered that Very impressed with this.About five years ago I finally saw a dermatologist for my extremely dry skin. He recommended either t/sal or t/gel as well as a prescription cream that I had to keep on with a shower cap over night. Nothing improved so I quit both after about a month. (I don't think I used it properly, to be fair)I recently decided to give this a try again. Wow I so glad I did! After one use, I saw a difference. My scalp has been pure white as far as I can remember. If I scratch my forehead lightly flakes fall off. (Dandruff within my hair usually isn't a problem for me. My hairline is awful though) after my first wash my hairline was very improved, and I was able to wipe some flakes away. The best way to describe it is if you tan or sunburn and are able to rub away dead skin. It was similar to that. I was excited enough by this to go read reviews.One stated it was important to follow directions exactly. I've never been a lather, rinse, AND REPEAT person, so I noted to repeat from now on. The bottle says to keep on a few  minutes minutes before rinsing, I followed another reviews suggestion to keep it on five minutes. I bought a dollar kitchen timer to make sure I did that.Day two showed more improvement. On today, day three, I really worked to get all over my scalp rather than concentrate on the worst part- hairline. I am so excited by the results! I don't recall my scalp every looking so good in my entire life.The downsides: 1) it's time consuming 2) I have long hair so it takes a  Long time to rinse. It gets very matted and heavy. I use a lot of conditioner but still seem to lose an extra amount of hair when I brush my hair out after. Make sure to buy detangler. 3) expensive for a shampoo. It's cheaper elsewhere than Amazon, so keep that in mind.These downsides are very worth it in my opinion. Spend the $10 and you'll probably see great results. The worst that can happen is you're out $10. That's it! I ordered this stuff to combat a pretty severe case of dandruff that started to develop about a year ago. The product is relatively effective at treating flakes. It didn't clear it up 100%, but it did drastically reduce the severity of the condition.What I really love about this product is how great of a shampoo it is. Besides the flakes, I've always struggled to find a shampoo that doesn't ridiculously dry out my hair. I started only shampooing every other day or so, but I found that it just resulted in having super dry hair for a day and then progressively clumpier and dirty hair until I shampooed again. This stuff leaves your hair clean feeling, smooth, REALLY shiny without drying at ALL. It's like what you would expect from a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner except 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners always really suck.It's 3% salicylic acid, though, so you have to be careful with it. I found I could use it every day and my hair and scalp would tolerate it very well, but my HANDS started getting extremely dry and lost feeling in several patches (I thought i was going to lose my finger print). So, I would suggest washing your hands THOROUGHLY after using it and applying a good moisturizer. You could probably stop the acid reaction by rinsing your hands with baking soda water as well, but it isn't something I've tried.tl;dr:-Amazing as a shampoo.-Treats flakes/dandruff pretty effectively, but condition returns after not using for 1-2 days.-Can demolish your hands/palms, so take caution in using regularly.-Much more effective than zinc pyrithione treatments for me. Cannot comment on effectiveness compared to selenium sulfide (Selsun) or ketaconazole (Nizoral).-Smells very, very neutral, but not unpleasant.",1,5,-4

If you have long or thick hair I would suggest buying 2 boxes. You will easily use all the mixture.Prep: I put some Vaseline around my hairline to eliminate some staining around my face, neck and ears. I also put on some clothes that I wouldn't mind staining if any henna were to get on them.  I didn't wear any gloves and the mixture stained my hands a greenish color for the day. No big deal but wear gloves if you want to avoid this.Mixing: I added hot water to the mix until soupy as directed. Putting the mixture on my hair was a bit difficult because it felt like I couldn't quite get it incorporated into all of my hair. This may be my own fault. Perhaps I didn't water it down quite enough? Make sure you add plenty of water so that you can get it into all of your hair. After I applied it as best I could, I wrapped my hair well in saran wrap. I also wrapped a strip of cotton around my hairline and pinned it at the top of my head to catch any dripping. That worked wonderfully and was very comfortable to me.  This may sound obvious, but do this all in the bathroom and don't get any on the floor as it may stain. You could put some newspaper down to make sure you avoid that if you're worried. All in all it's not that difficult to do it yourself but it gets tricky around the back area. If you have a friend who can help that's always a plus. :)Waiting time: I left it in my hair for about 2 hours.End result: Rinsing my hair took a bit of patience. I used extra conditioner to help remove the little particles from the mixture which worked well. I blow dried and styled as usual. The color is subtle but drastic enough to know the difference. It looks very natural and healthy right now. Shiny and very soft. I love henna and the fact that it's all natural makes me love it all the more. No more harmful chemicals!! Hopefully the color sticks around for awhile. If so, I'll definitely do this again. The seller shipped my item fast and their pricing is very reasonable. Satisfied customer!UPDATE:12/29/09My hair is no longer even remotely black in color or tint. This stuff wears off fast. I'm not sorry that I tried it because it wasn't expensive but I won't use the product again because it just doesn't last long enough. It would be worth it if the color lasted for at least a month but a little over a week just doesn't cut it. :) I tried this henna out because I'm pregnant and wanted something natural to use to cover my 40% grey head of hair. It really works wonderfully. Like I said, about 40% of my hairs are grey, and the rest is brown, and this henna gives a rich red color to all of my hair. I'd recommend you do some google research for tips on how to dye with henna, as it helped me to use this product properly.Here are a few dying tips for anyone interested: The day you're going to dye your hair, wash it that morning. Mix the henna powder with lemon juice (the acidity is supposed to help the dying process) in a metal or glass bowl until it's a nice, muddy consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit for a few hours (my mixture always sits for at least 8 hours).In preparing to dye your hair, lay down some old towels to catch any messy henna that might fall to the ground. Wear clothes you don't care about getting dyed either, or cover yourself with a trash bag that you've cut a hole into so that your head fits through (later you can tear yourself out of the trash bag so you don't have to pull it over your head), or just invest in a rain poncho or one of the covers they'd put on you at a salon if you know you're going to be dying every 3-4 weeks or so! I apply vaseline around my hair line (forehead, down and around and on the ears, and onto the back of the neck). Have a roll of plastic wrap nearby, and gloves for your hands. I use clips to section my hair, and luckily my husband is just patient enough to help cover my roots with the henna to start, then I take over applying the henna to the rest of my long thick hair (btw, I need at least 2 boxes of this henna, or a total of 4 oz for my thick hair that goes a few inches past my shoulders).Once completely applied I cover my head with plastic wrap, and then with a towel over top of that. For my own hair I've found through trial and error that the henna should sit for about 2 hours before I rinse it out. So I make a night of it and have a movie to watch while the henna does it's job. You can do a patch test on some strands of your hair that you've collected from a brush or after you comb it to better determine what amount of time will work for your hair type/color.",1,4,-3

I was not completely sold on the product after reading the reviews but I figured for the price I would give it a shot. I had my highlights touched up on Monday and noticed that there were some brassy spots. I didn't want to get back to the salon as my hair tends to crave moisture and the highlights are already damaging enough.I put this product on and left it in my hair for about 4 minutes. What did I notice? The smell is pleasant without being overly heavy. This shampoo is much darker purple than the previous purple shampoo I had been using. The bottle is nicely shaped and its deep red hue makes it easy to pick out amongst my other hair products. This shampoo is pretty thick so I had to get used to it. My hair is between my chin and my shoulders and I used about twice as much shampoo as I would with a sulfate-laden product, but that is to be expected. It rinsed out cleanly without any residue. Because this product is so purple I washed and rinsed my hair before washing my body to be sure I didn't have any lingering purple reside anywhere.I did use this shampoo with my ordinary conditioner as I wasn't ready to make a complete leap into this product.After towel drying my hair I was skeptical but as I was drying it with the hairdryer I noted that most of the brassiness was gone! Wow! I still have a few brassy tones and I'm thinking that another round of shampoo will help even more. My hair is about the same softness that it was with my previous shampoo--no real change there.I'm pleasantly surprised and for the price, would recommend trying it. I didn’t think this made much a difference on my grays, and it makes my hair oily within a day. However m, I appreciate that it does not carry the bad toxins in the ingredients that’s ultimately bad for your health. I’m straddling the middle on this product. I bleached my own hair and the toner I used didn't really bring down the yellowness of my hair. My hair stylist in the past had suggested this brand of shampoo and conditioner, so I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did! The shampoo has a nice light floral scent and smells great. It is a dark purple. My hair feels good, is soft, and looks so much better than it did before.I've only used this with the Joico Color Endure Violet Conditioner, which works great with the shampoo. The bottles look nice and function well.The directions say to apply to wet hair, later, leave in hair 3-5 minutes and rinse. It says to use 2-3 times a week. Be careful not to leave on for too long or use too often. When I over saturated once, it turned my hair a very light purple. I didn't mind it because I like unnatural colors, but you might have a different opinion. If you follow the directions, you should be fine.Ingredients: Water/aqua/eau, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, cocamidopropyl betaine, cocamidopropyl betaine, cocamide mea, glycol stearate, pentapeptide-29 cysteinamide, pentapeptide-30 cysteinamide, tetrapeptide-28 argininamide, tetrapeptide-29 argininamide, hydrolyzed keratin, cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, panthenol, polyquaternium-7, diazolidinyl urea, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, tetrasodium edta, silicone quaternium-16, amodimethicone, peg-6 caprylic/capric glycerides, undeceth-11, c11-15 pareth-7, butyloctanol, undeceth-5, laureth-9, glycerin, trideceth-12. iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, ppg-12-buteth-1, polyamide-2, limonene, linalool, fragrance/parfum, ext. violet 2 (ci 60730), red 22 (ci 17200)One of the pictures I included is before I found these products, then the other half is after my first use. The change is insane.If you find this helpful, please click on the helpful button below. :) I have been using this Joico shampoo for quite a while now and I love it! I've actually reviewed the smaller bottle in the past and love it so much I upgraded to the larger bottle. I love it for many reasons:1. It helps get rid of brassiness and also keeps my blonde hair looking bright! The violet color of the shampoo is much darker than ones you could get at any grocery store/drug store, which makes it work so much better. I find that for the best results you should lather your hair with the shampoo, then let sit ~2-3 minutes before washing it out. Then apply conditioner as usual.2. Not only does this shampoo help get rid of brassiness and keep my blonde bright, but it also leaves my hair feeling soft! I love the way my hair feels after using this shampoo!3. This shampoo is sulfate-free! Joico sells a similar product in a purple shampoo bottle that is a little cheaper but that one has sulfates in it, so I believe this one is much more worth it. I've used the other one in the past and changes to this one.I recommend this to all of my blonde friends. I will be attaching photos of the color of the shampoo on a piece of white tissue, and also my blonde hair to show how it doesn't look brassy! I have dark purple/eggplant hair so I use this shampoo to prolong the color. It really works well for that reason. After previous attempts at dying, the color would always wash out no matter how cold the water I used was. This shampoo has helped the purple last long. It's not as bright as it was after dying it, but when I ask people what color they see my hair as, they still say purple. Washing my hair every other day with cold water and keeping this shampoo in for at least two minutes has yielded the best results. Sure it's still a bit of work, but it's definitely helped. It's free of sulfates and those other nasty chemicals that strip that color out of your hair which is another bonus. Most shampoos that claim to preserve color still have those terrible chemicals in them. Over all I'm really happy with this shampoo for use on my purple hair. I wish I could give it another half a star because the only reason I'm not giving it five is from the smell. It reminds my of that ""bubblegum"" flavored medicine you were given as a kid when you had strep throat. It doesn't last all day, but it's not nice when you have to let the shampoo set for a few minutes.",5,2,3

Smells good also no comment In one of my travels to Costa Rica I went to a salon, after the haircut the stylist used this spray on my hair.  My hair looked so beautiful, it was like magical!  So, I decided to buy one and use it on my house, and voilá... it worked. It is such a good product!  Every time I use it my hair looks shiny and it is very soft. I highly recommend it. This spray doesn't leave your hair greasy, but it leaves your hair looking healthier and moisturized.En uno de mis viajes a Costa Rica, fui a un salón a cortarme el cabello. Al final, la estilista usó este spray en mi cabello, y lo panchó, y fue como si hubiera hecho magia, mi cabello me quedó tan brillante y suave, que decidí comprarme una botella. No me arrepiento. Lo uso todos los días. Mi cabello es fino y tiende a ser grasoso, pero este spray no deja mi cabello grasoso ni me quita cuerpo.  Se lo recomiendo a cualquier persona que sufra con el frizz... santo remedio. A great product at a great value. I have hair to my mid back and don't like to weigh it down with heavy conditioners every time I wash it.  Years ago I came across Moisture Kick when my then-hairdresser (Michael Boychuk) recommended it for detangling.  My hair gets so tangled when I wash it and don't deep condition so I gave it a try, even though I had visions of the No More Tears spray of childhood, which neither detangled nor prevented tears.  I just love it for detangling, I spray it all over my hair (don't drench it, just even spray), wait about 60 seconds and my hair combs right out.  It doesn't weigh my hair down at all, just calms it so it doesn't frizz.  That said, I don't necessarily agree with others here who feel it has great conditioning benefits.  For me, it's just helps detangle, but I don't notice that otherwise my hair is really ""conditioned"" in any meaningful way.  Anyway, I can't live without it for the reasons I said, and if others are getting more out of it than I do, well, that's all good! I have been using this product religiously for about 13 years and it’s the only thing that can take completely damaged hair and make it beautiful. Very light weight and not greasy like most leave ins I usually pair this with it’s a 10 as that has a heat protectant and that’s really the only reason as I’ve used this alone or the past for a good chunk of my life and I can say with all certainty it’s why my hair is so healthy and grows so well as I have fine hair that I use to love to experiment on. Also the smell is a clean smell. Isn’t  overpowering. One of the best on the market! I hope it never goes away! If you have the colored hair the pink bottle is the same formula just helps hold in color! I never let any hairdresser, or anyone for that matter, put any products in my hair. I find they make my hair very greasy, and I do not like the feeling, or even smell. However, finally, a hairdresser turned me on to Moisture kick, over my complaining not to put any product in my hair.Well, I was in love! That must have been almost 10 years ago, and I have been using it ever since, and turning all sorts of people on to this product.The product really is light, with a wonderful smell. It works amazingly, considering how light it is. You cannot feel it in your hair, but you will feel the results. My hair becomes much more manageable, and all the frizzes disappear! It also becomes so much softer and shinier. Buen producto!",5,5,0

I've tried different products because I also have extreme scalp itch and seborrheic dermatitis.  So, I have been experimenting with many conditioners to balance out both dry hair and dermatitis.  I've tried the common shampoo and conditioner solutions to dermatitis but found that they only helped the dermatitis for a short period of time if at all and dried out my hair to the point of damaging it.  My hair breaks very easily since it is so dry thus getting snarles all the time.  I would end up with balls of hair by the time I would get done combing through it.  I know that with curly hair I am not supposed to wash my hair every day, especially with it being so dry (a common combination).  But with the dermatitis and oily scalp, I seriously have no choice.  The build-up gets extreme, especially when I use those common shampoos recommended on commercials and by dermatologists.  I found that sulfate-free toothpaste helped with stopping my mouth sores nearly to non-existent, so I thought maybe sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners would help with my scalp and hair.  First, I tried Burt's Bees and Borage.  They slowed down the build up, but my hair was just as dry and tangled as before.  Then, I tried Organix Coconut Milk and Shea Butter that helped for a period of time, but the build up came back with a vengence and my hair was barely healthier.  Then, I went to Giovanni, and BINGO!  I scored big with the Leave-in Conditioner, Tea Tree, and Smooth as Silk Shampoo (I think it's called?).  Less build up and more moisturized hair was the result.  But I still fought my hair a good portion of the time with the comb with big balls of dried-out hair and serious knots if I didn't comb it out.  I came across the Tone It Up girls who recommended the John Masters Organics Sea Salt to help with volume (this makes my hair drier and curlier to Shirley Temple curly which I can get naturally anyway), tried another product to help with Sebum (not sure how this is working yet), and tried the detangler.  It was a miracle from the minute I put the detangler in.  The tangles seemed to melt away!  My hair stays moist all day, and less hair comes out when I comb it.  Yea!  I love the citrus all natural fragrance, it's all natural (no sulfates), and it leaves my hair so soft!  The only downside is the size of the bottle combined with the price, but if it saves my hair, I will pay for it.  I only get one head of hair, so I better take care of it!  Now, my next order of business is my scalp itch, but I'm just thankful for my soft luxurious hair!  :)  If you need more ideas for shampoos/conditioners, I also recommend Giovanni shampoos/conditioners, especially if you suffer with any of the same conditions (especially the dry hair) as I do.  And stay away from sulfates...especially Sodium Lauryl Sulfate!  They are brutal to your hair and mouth!  Do your research!  You can start here:  […] if you want.  I know I have been reading my ingredients since I've been given the heads up about SLS causing mouth sores that I suffered with for many years.  So, I hope this helps!  :) I have been highlighting my hair 4-6 times per year for about 20 years. According to hairdressers (and I go to the eco-friendly salons that use safer products), my hair is long and fine, and I have a lot of it. Recipe for tangles! Beyond the tangles, though, my ends get terribly dry-I'd say the last 5 to 6 inches can get pretty desperate looking if I don't keep on top of them. So....I'm constantly waging a battle to keep my hair all-over shiny, soft, smoothe, and balanced looking. I wash my hair 2-3 times per week, because if I do it more than that, it looks dull, lifeless, and straw-like from the middle on down. If I'm not super careful and selective about the products I use, I end up with a greasy looking scalp and a dry bottom. Not a good look. The answer to my hair conundrum: the Neroli Citrus Detangler. I use it like a regular conditioner, and I use a lot of it. One 8oz bottle probably lasts me only 6-7 washes, but my goodness, it works. I apply it to my hair from the base of my skull downward, leave it on for 5-10 minutes and then rinse it out under tepid to cool water (depending on the season and how cold I can stand it). Result: shiny, soft, easy-to-comb through hair that smells subtly delicious but not cloying or headache-inducing. *One final mention: I am chemically sensitive*, and this product's light fragrance doesn't bother me at all. It is extremely rare that I can find a scented product that I can use liberally without exacerbating my condition. I could roll around in this fragrance all day and feel great-probably because it's natural and not full of neurotoxic, endocrine-disrupting phthalates and the like.*i.e. I can't tolerate synthetic fragrances, disinfectant, or pesticide chemicals (the worst). Public service announcement-watch the chemicals you use on your body and in/around your home. I had no idea I could trigger chemical snesitivity in myself by chronic, inadvertent exposure to everyday toxins (I thought it could only happen after an intense exposure). In my case, it was regular, Orkin-style pesticide treatments for cockroaches and rats at my FORMER place of employment that pushed me over the edge. I've had pronounced chemical sensitivity ever since. I tmay never compeltely resolve due to epigenetic changes that certain chemicals can induce. Watch out for yourself, and protect your children from the harsh chemicals. You won't know you're vulnerable until it's too late.",3,2,1

I use it a few times a week now because at first I was using the shampoo everyday but noticed it was really drying out my hair and scalp but however it wasn't making my scalp worse or causing breakouts to worsen. Also a little bit of it goes along way and foams real easy. I'm definitely over all satisfied and gonna be using this shampoo for years to come. i use this with the matching conditioner which helps but as someone with a really rare allergy + some regular allergies which don’t allow me to use ANY scents or many ingredients common in shampoos, this is the best alternative i’ve found. i have very thin hair with 3A curls and this really strips out moisture, unfortunately, but again using with the conditioner helps to restore that. i use olive oil on my scalp for hair growth sometimes and two rounds of shampooing with this is perfect to get all the oil residue out! smells a little like alcohol but only if you really sniff for it. all in all, the shampoo is definitely drying for the scalp and hair but for me that is manageable… i wish there was a curl-safe formula for this shampoo or any sort of curl-safe product for ppl with very sensitive skin! this does the job in the interim. I have always been sensitive to fragrances. I used to be able to tolerate products with a light scent but not I’m getting to the point where any hint of fragrance makes my eyes swell and I get a terrible headache. I am now having to look for 100% fragrance free products which is how I discovered Vanicream. I had purchased their face cleanser which is awesome so I decided to try out the shampoo. The pros are, it is truly fragrance free. It provides a good lather and gets your hair clean. The con for me is that it doesn’t provide enough moisture. My scalp is oily so I do appreciate that this product helps to keep my scalp oil free but my hair is long, course and curly. That’s where I need the moisture. After using this shampoo, I had to use double the amount of conditioner to get my hair detangled.  The extra conditioner I had to use, left my hair limp and it was difficult to style.  I think this a really good product but not for my course, long, curly hair. I have salt and pepper hair and ever since the gray started coming in I have not been able to find a shampoo, from the cheapest to the most expensive, that would not cause itchy scalp, hair fall, frizz and my natural wave was gone! As a desperate lady I decided to try this shampoo!! It will always be my Holy Grail!! Please never change this formula! No itchy scalp, no hairfall and I have soft bouncy girls!! I can’t believe it!! I am so very thrilled! Yay. proud of my hair again finally!!!! Purchased on recommendation from my dermatologist.  I need to condition my hair to reduce the amount that is pulled out by a brush.  The combo does NOTHING for my hair.  I had switched from my regular shampoo that caused no issues because of the ingredients.  Tried a bargain brand to get me through and my skin FREAKED out.  As the product ends up running down one's body, it makes sense.  After less than a week of using both, my hair roots were HEAVY, it felt greasy and dirty, worse than if I did not wash it for two days.  I am a daily washer, can't handle less and I could not take it. It may have helped my skin, I am not positive about that - it did clear up, but I think the steroids did most of the work.  I am off the steroid cream and using another mid-range regular shampoo and I have mild itching, that is annoying but tolerable while I figure things out.  Considering that people with severe allergies need this sort of product, it it works for you and mentally provides comfort that you are 'shampooing' with no bubbles and conditioning with not tangible results - it is a great product.  I used the Cetaphil bar soap one night attempting to wash out the 'greasy' feel, it didn't work, but the bar soap did not make my hair feel any worse than it was already.  It is that I just prefer the way my long (almost waist length) hair feels when washed with sulfate laden shampoo and conditioners and that a decades later it is hard to change. It was not worth the money for me. Great price, great product. Better than expensive shampoo. A little of this shampoo goes a long way.  I had the same bottle for my long hair for a year.  It’s great for my sensitivities.  My hair feels like straw afterwards so you need a good conditioner.  Their conditioner doesn’t do anything for my hair.  I use a different fragrance free leave in conditioner.  I also use jojoba oil in my hair regularly to combat the dryness.  Bonus is I only have to wash my hair every 4-5 days. This is a great product, it cleans very well and is gentle on a sensitive scalp. Other shampoos caused scalp distress from itching and hives.",1,4,-3

Excellent I have allergy to most haircar3 products. I use this, the shampoo and conditioner. They work great! Unscented and no additives. Dermatologist recommended and it’s great , the hold is good for fine hair and sensitive scalp / a little goes a long way / no heavy build up / would definitely recommend to others I used the product to hold curls in my hair. This does not feel good in the air. It's totally crunchy.But I want my hair to stick straight up like my bangs did in the 80s and this *almost* does that. There are a hundred non fragrance-free options that work perfectly and feel pretty good. Alas, this new allergy has taken over my life.I'm vain, so the fact that the hold is good is enough for me. I use a lot of the Vanicream products and wanted to try the hairspray.  It is free of everything - including a firm hold.  It does not hold my hair and feels like nothing is in.  I have used it a handful of times to give the product a fair chance, but it does not work.I am very disappointed in this product and will not be ordering it again. Product seems fine. Not too sticky or watery or crunchy like I've seen others say....at least not for me. The sprayer on mine works great. But I can't seem to use this hair spray because AS SOON as I spray any at all on my scalp starts burning like crazy and my neck started breaking out again since I've been using it....oh well. I'm not sure what I've became allergic to anyway. Also it took FOREVER to come. Ordered December 15th 2022 and it finally came January 10th 2023.

This is pretty much a standard spray bottle, though one thing is that the tube that sucks the liquid up is very long, like longer than the bottle is tall by several inches, so you don't have the short little tube where you have to refill it when there is still liquid on the bottom. Other than that, all I can say is that it is exactly what it says it is, and functions as spray bottle should.Oh, one thing, I noticed a lot of reviewers saying beware, this is a very light spray... I found it to be much more powerful than I expected. I used this to put various substances in my hair, and the spray is so wide and strong that my shirt/skin is wet when I'm done. I mean, I think that is a good thing, because I can saturate my hair with it, but just so you know. I use this for misting my watercolors.  It works well. misty works I got this spray bottle to water my plant, which only needed a couple sprays of water once a month.This is a great spray bottle for that, since it sprays a light mist so I can avoid overwatering my plant. I can also see this spray bottle being useful for hair care and cooking.The only thing to keep in mind is that this spray bottle only sprays a light mist -- there are no settings to change the amount of mist like some of the other spray bottles you may see on the market. Barring that, if all you're looking for is a light spray bottle then this is the one! We used this for my daughter hair. Its the perfect size to keep with her morning hair products without taking uo to much room. It sprays a nice fine mist that gently saturates her hair with out drenching it. We used it for three months before the tip to the spray nozzle popped out. We easily put it back in but during every use it would pop out so we stopped using it. Over all forthe price I would recommend. Strong spray, solid plastic, easy to use. Good value for your money. I use this to spray diluted peppermint oil. this bottle leaks a lot and is not sufficiently air tight, so it takes quite a bit of extra force and sprays to get the desired amount to the targeted area while quite a lot of liquid would get wasted due to leaking onto your hand and finger during the spray. it becomes almost impossible to spray when there are less than 10% of the remaining liquid in the bottle despite bottom of the tube is still fully submerged in the liquidI would look for something else It's a fine spray bottle, does what it says. Not the best value for money though, I can't believe I spent so much on an emty spray bottle.",5,4,1

I got 4 tortoise shell, 4 clear and 4 black. Which is a bummer because I really wanted more of the brown/cream shades as I have light brown hair. I have already used them so I won't be returning it but just keep that in mind you may not get the same item pictured :/I got these to replace the super tiny rubber bands for when I want to do my hair half-up-half-down and they work AMAZINGly. I could not have guessed that these would hold so tightly, and with my thick hair and a lot of it, it holds all day and works like a charm.These are a good size if you have thick/a lot of hair to put it half up half down, or to pull back one side of your hair in a vintage way. I would not suggest these to hold all of your hair up or in a bun unless you have very thin hair.These are pretty thick and seem very durable. Like I said, I have thick hair and a lot of it, and I have had no issues getting them tightly on my head and holding well. I am excited to try a lot of styles with these and am already looking into longer ones to hold up more/all of my hair! Great alternative to rubber bands that you lose, break, have to keep buying and just end up in the landfill after a few uses. These are just like I remembered them.  I had some years ago which were good and held in place all day.  I took a chance when I bought these because they were online and I really couldn't check out the quality.  You get 12 in a pack.  Four of each: Black, tortoise shell Brown, and clear.  They're sturdy and hold lots of hair or even a little bit.  They work great and held up all day!  Great price too!I saw some people have bad reviews for this product saying that they are shiny plastic and brittle.  they are shiny and they are stiff but they work perfectly for holding lots of hair in my opinion.  I wore them all day and even slipped with them and they still held in place when I got up!  Works for me! great value The product is not what I ordered.  The product that I ordered and thought I was getting is great quality, different material then what I received. The product that I ordered is great for people with thick hair and the teeth on the combs don’t break. They come in a pack with 6 different colors.  What I received is flimsy and breaks easily. The quality is something In the order I in dollar tree. I want what I ordered not what they feel like sending me. Update. Ordered again and got the same cheap combs. This company should change that picture. It inaccurate. People order expecting to get what’s on the picture not what ever they want to send. I remember using these constantly in the 80s to tease my bangs and hadn't given much thought to them since then.  But as fate would have it, I was invited to a number of themed parties that required more intricate updos and I found myself searching for accessories that could do some heavy lifting.  These felt a bit too expensive, and I was especially thrown off by the varying prices and shipping options based on color, but when I surprisingly couldn't find them at any brick and mortar store, I gave in to Amazon and ordered.And am so happy I did! They are sturdier than I expected - a must for my long hair.  If you've ever had a flimsy comb break during a frantic getting ready process, or worse: later on during the actual event, you understand my frustration with wimpy plastic. These are strong and hold wavy hair for hours.  I even found a way to work them into a Brigitte Bardot look for a wedding. So apparently you can achieve both classy and costumey hairstyles with these combs. Even the colors, of which I was skeptical (olive green?), work well and are pretty much camouflaged in my light brown hair. Recommended. I had never seen this product before.  Glad I tried because it does the job. I only recently started wearing my hair with combs again while my bangs grow out. The ones I had were too flexible. I am pretty sure they are Goodys and they bend out of shape very easily and then won't hold my hair. I have the same problem with the twisted wire combs. Since I can't find plastic combs in stores, I was a little leary of buying these sight unseen, but as a Prime Add-on item, I wasn't finding anything cheaper. I am really pleased with them. They are made of hard plastic and don't bend out of shape. They aren't as sturdy as the combs I wore in the 70's, but aren't the cheapo generic plastic of the last combs I bought at Dollar General 10 years or more ago. I know they won't last forever, but these should last me until my bangs are long again. Colors are Brown; Olive; Cream; Black; White and Navy. They have a matte finish. These combs are exactly what I needed.  They hold my fine hair and stay in my hair.  They are quite sturdy and last a long time.  I’ve previously had combs and they lasted for years, which makes them a great deal.  I only had to replace them because I lost too many.",4,2,2

It seems the formula has changed & it now has a light fragrance that I don’t like and my hair is not as soft.Wish Giovanni would go back to the original formula. I have porous grey unhealthy curly dry weak hair. This is the only thing that actually makes my hair shiny and soft without smelling like a chemical explosion. I love this company. I’ve been a customer of theirs since the beginning. I like their simple Eco Chic line, not their other stuff. I love this stuff. I have curly hair and it usually gets a little frizzy on the top. Since using this I don’t have anymore frizz. When my hair dries naturally I love the way it looks compared to how it used to look. My hair looks so healthy now. It’s not dry or frizzy. I highly recommend this for curly frizzy hair. It’s changed my hair and I love it!! I’ve used this for a long time. I use it after every wash and love the way it keeps my hair from drying out and splitting. I had bought a tube of this on sale at a retail store (kind of a random item for them) and fell in love with the just-right amount of conditioning it provides for my hair. Doesn't weigh it down or smell like anything strong, just does a great job. I couldn't find it again after my original tube ran out so I was thrilled to buy a 3 pack here for far less than my bargain tube. I have waist length hair and it is a challenge to keep it looking smooth and shiny. This ""reconstructor"" is great! Great product for softening coarse hair. I actually use it on my beard since I cannot use oil now with the mask situation. It really keeps the hair soft and manageable in lieu of my usual routine. I have 4z hair, I’m a blackos black woman with very coily hair and I swear by Giovanni 🥰 I ve been trying many brands as a product junkie and when I tried this, my hair just melt like crazy...

It is great for short hair to help control fly aways. I mix is with a tiny bit of hair pomade for light texture and a ""piecy"" hair do without being too heavy handed. I love this product because it's light and wispy with your hairstyle. Heard about this product and thought, ""My hair is dry ... wonder if Brilliantine will help?""Sure enough, it does.  I place a little product (dime size) in my hands, rub gently throughout my hair and immediately it looks & feels softer, shinier and just better overall.And it adds just enough hold that sometimes I don't even add gel or other products afterward -- the Brilliantine often is all I need.Has a pleasant mild scent that I like. I do like this product as finishing product for thin hair. Gets rid of frizz and doesn't weigh hair down. Pretty pricy? This product is perfect for the days when I don't have the time, or the inclination to style my hair. It is a helpful general moisturizer. It has a soft light smell that I like. Super lightweight , soft, and non greasy. My stylist recommended this to help improve texture (without weight) for my super fine shoulder length hair. It’s creamy (not waxy or sticky) and only took a very tiny amount (smaller than a pea) to work. It did create a slightly more piece-y effect. I didn’t notice any significant change in sheen as the tube advertises. That could be because of the small amount used though. The scent is great! I have even used it when I’m not styling my hair just because of the scent. It smells almost like freshly mowed grass with a bit of citrus also. Very light and clean. Pricey, but worth it and should last a long time. I’d buy it again. I have relied on brilliantine for several years now and have never been disappointed with my results.I have a TON of long, slightly wavy hair that varies from very thick/coarse to very fine/smooth hair texture and I almost always has some level of frizz occurring.  I use several products to reign in my volume and almost always use this one to finish everything off. It works especially well on flat ironed hair and completely eliminates any strays that want to stick up or out.I decided yesterday to try out how it would work with a more challenging job and used it to smooth my hair after it had been in a braid all day. Normally when I brush it out of a braid it turns into a huge, puffy mass of voluminous frizz, so before I used a brush I applied more than my normal amount (which is still not much) of brilliantine. I gently brushed through my hair with a bristle brush (which usually causes the most frizz with my braided waves) and was delighted when I ended up with hair that looked like I belonged in the 1920s. This morning when I awoke the waves were still tamed and my hair looks amazing.I have found that this product does not work alone, so plan to use something else to add control and use this as a finishing product.

I've read the reviews and didn't quite believe them saying it had no scent, not even the ""no smell"" scent. You know what I mean -the medicinal/plasticy smell. Cheaper products tend to have that cheap plastic smell. Really. It has smell!! I am one of the sensitive to smells people, so those who are sensitive to smells can be assured that it is safe smell wise!Also… It has no crunch. Unlike many gels it has no crunch! After using it, my hair was perfectly styled and unbelievably soft. I put a mere drop on a palm, rubbed my hands together, and scrunched my hair into place. I would say this gel is definitely worth the money! For someone like me it will probably last a very very long time! I am a curly girl that needs gel to keep the curl from frizzing. I also have the misfortune of breaking out from products in my hair. I really can only use this gel if I don't want to break out and itch on my cheeks. So far, this is treating my skin well. I pair it with Seen curl cream. I don't know if they make my hair look the best it could, but I care more about not breaking out from my hair products. I'm sure I'll be buying this for the rest of my life. I wish they had a leave in conditioner. Not the best choice for African-American natural hair maintenance. I recently began transitioning my hair to natural styling and associated maintenance. I selected specialty shampoo, conditioning and styling products that focus on natural hair maintenance and grooming. Fast-forward: I learned that I'm allergic to certain hair product ingredients and I should use fragrance-free, allergen-free products. My dermatologist recommended Vanicream line of products. Use of their shampoo and conditioners works well though not as much moisturizing as my original  products for natural hair. I later began using the Vanicream styling gel. This item does not leave my hair as soft and moisturized as my original styling products. The Vanicream line of products are excellent if you are professionally advised to use only fragrance-free, allergen-free hair products. I have purchased this same brand in other forms as well, including shampoo, conditioner, face cream, and hairspray. I bought it because it does not have perfume or dyes and is free from harmful chemicals. there are very few hair/skin products available in this category. I appreciate it that Vanicream produces a variety of affordable products without all the crap that most manufacturers add to theirs. I wish that it had better hold. as soon as i comb my fingers through my hair after it dries, the 'hold' of the gel is lost. But I have had the same trouble with other hair gels I've tried as well, so I can't fault it for that since I haven't found a single hair gel that keeps its hold after it is combed. Overall it's a good product for those with sensitive skin or who do not want to add dyes and chemicals to their skin/hair. This is my first time using this product & I am thoroughly satisfied. It works great. My skin does not like hair products. Mostly, they make me itch. Not this one! Finally a product I don't react to. This hair gel does not irritate the scalp and is unscented and free of irritating chemicals. It works great and doesn't cause itchiness!",2,5,-3

Color Safe (Pack of 3)","I have low porosity hair and as such it's very easy to get dry and break. My hairdresser recommended this product and it works well in keeping my hair moist. A top: It's good if you mix some with water and spray your hair once a day to keep the moisture in . My hair what else!! I have searched and searched for a light, but moisturizing leave-in. Since February, I have incorporated this product into my routine and, my hair stays moisturized much longer than ever before. A little bit goes a long way, and my hair absolutely loves it! #10’s across the Board! According to Amazon I've ordered this product 24 times.  It is my go to hair product for days I style my naturally curly hair or just want a little product until my next wash.In my last order, I received a chunky, thick, gel like product that feels sticky and heavy on my hair.  I've used this everyday since 2007.  Something is not right. I’ve been using this for years. Natural hair. 3c/4a.This has no scent- perfect for those who dont want a scentVery moisturizing- melts into wet hair. When you apply it to dry hair/slightly damp it seems to sit there and feels sticky (i deduct 1 star for that)Mixes well with gels - ive using it with wetline, african pride Just when I thought Aunt Jackie’s leave-in was the only one that worked for me. I found this, and with reluctancy gave it a try and Wow!Mind you, “its been sitting in my cart all year 2021 and I only just ordered it in January”.I gave it two months and I believe I can write this review.This product’s moisture retention for my type 4 hair is above the charts. It is moisturising and softening and leaves no white overcoat.It crosses the T’s on my regimen, and I will purchase more as long as the price remains reasonable. ☕️ I use these on my biracial kids hair and it is great for their dry porous curls I love it! I purchased the pack of 3 when I was relaxed and my hair didn't really like it. Fast forward I started to stretch my relaxers then transition now I'm natural and have been purchasing different leave in con'd that just doesn't seem to cater to 4c hair like they claim so I found this product way in the back of my cabinet behind dozens and dozens of products. Don't know what made me give it another try but I'm so happy I did!! It made my 4c curls pop! I applied it on an old unwashed hair to re-do my large braidout (on each side). I didn't need to add water but I added a small amount of extra virgin olive oil then eco styler olive oil gel to tame the fly away hairs and perfect the style. I'm so mad that I've been just wasting money following the ""Instagram product trends"" when I had the secret in my cabinet the entire time. My next wash day is in two days. I'll see if it works just as well on damp hair. And in the future when I'm ready to blow dry again I'll see if it works. Tip: I applied about a quarter size amount to both sides of my hair and works it through. Once I applied the gel (because I need to be heavy handed with the gel to lay my hair) it look like it may leave residue but once you work it in and tie your hair up its clear and popping!",4,4,0

Building Fibers,"So, if you're bothering to read reviews about anything like this in your ongoing battle with baldness, then let me be clear, right up front - the hair loss is winning the war.  To terribly misquote Jim Morrison, ""No hair gets out of here alive"".... So, you're hoping against all odds that some miracle product will be a cheap, effective, undetectable cure-all in your fight against genetics or disease...well, the good news is THIS PRODUCT KIND OF WORKS. Let me be as transparent as the fine little hairs you're hoping will grow on your head - if you have some hair, but it's thinning pretty bad, this stuff will make it look fuller and hide some of the dreaded scalp showing through - however, if you plan on people getting really close to it, you can see the toppik on your scalp (at least, the dark colors show up if you're Caucasian or light skinned) - but this should work well for a job interview, a date in a restaurant, an acting/theatre gig, maybe even a family gathering - but if you plan on getting lucky and he/she not noticing the smudges on the pillow in the morning, you are out of luck....If battling hair loss is what you're up against, then Toppik is, metaphorically, another tool in the tool box.  Use it with along with everything else - but use it in moderation. Too much and you're a powdered, bald donut.Finally, don't blindly listen to the claims by some of these Amazon reviewers saying it's ""amazing"" and ""no one noticed"" - because, if anyone looked close enough, they probably could tell you've got cornstarch type colored powder layering your nearly hairless scalp. On the other hand, don't listen to all these complainers saying it doesn't work at all or that it's garbage - they're just angry, balding trolls with sweaty scalps who were just hoping to find a dirt cheap solution to a problem that has plagued men and women forever.  If you have little or no hair, this product really won't work - but if you're in the middle of your hair-less fight, you'll have some pretty good luck with this.  I hope this review helps - as I'm someone who's done Bosley, Propecia, Rogaine, Toppik, Tocotrienols and have had some luck with all of them.  If, after my long winded review you're still unsure (and you should be) then buy the tiny cheap bottle of Toppik (it will set you back around $10 with shipping) - it's a small price to pay to see if a product works for you. Thanks, and God bless you, tiny little hairs, God bless you, every one. I’m incredibly self-conscious about the thinning/balding in my crown. My mom uses a brand similar to this and swore by it, but I was skeptical about it potentially not matching (my hair has a few different shades of brown, so one generic color option made me nervous). I hadn’t used it for months until I went to a work conference where I didn’t feel it appropriate to wear a hat like I usually do. I first put it along my hairline, which made my nerves even worse since the initial application was somewhat messy and was wiping off—it wasn’t until I applied two or three layers and kept combing it into my hair did I start to trust it; I put a few layers on my crown with careful, even brushing, and I honestly can’t describe how confident this stuff made me feel! It blended flawlessly and held without any bit of it rubbing/wearing off. I would definitely recommend! I have a mild degree of male pattern baldness, especially on the left side of my crown, not enough to bother me but enough for it to be a concern. I used this stuff and it matched perfectly to my dark hair. My hair looks like I'm 18 again, very pleased.. Wish  it had like a sprayer instead of a shaker but I was amazed with how this stuff worked. This will not be a good product for someone with significant balding. But excellent if your hair isn't quite as thick as it once was. I went gray pretty young and keep color on my hair. My gray is very white and my natural color is dark brown, so when my roots start growing out within two weeks of having color done, it is very noticeable. I read online that some people use this to cover gray roots between having their color done. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try. IT WORKS! And because I don't use it every day, but just near the end of the color cycle, this one little bottle lasted me from June of 2022 until now (March 2023) when I'm just now re-ordering. I HIGHLY recommend. As a female, I find this problem very devastating and difficult.  I'll use a powder to cover the thinning and balding on my hair and then apply Toppix after that for added coverage and thickness.  It stays in place all day and then some, does not come off with sweating or rain, only with a shampoo.  There is a bit of 'fly away' since it's such a fine fiber product but they are all like that.  This is my go-to for this difficult problem. My hair is starting to thin at my crown and this product has been amazing! It easily covers up my thin spots and looks very natural. I wish it was a larger bottle for the price, but it has been a life saver while waiting for new hair to grow. If you’re self conscious of your widening hair part or have any thinning I would definitely recommend! This product works well but is much too expensive and very little product in item. There are much better products out there that work better, last longer and not as expensive.  Unfortunately, I cannot give you the names of the other products. Due to age and covid twice my hair has thinned out considerably...try as I might to hide it, as hair doesn’t naturally appear overnight, if at all, I came across this product...it’s a powder that you sprinkle on the area where signs of thinning appear and it adheres to the hair that is around the area you want to cover up...it does not stain and washes out when you next shampoo...it is a light powder and it does not weigh your hair down...it actually looks very natural... I recommend this as I’ve personally used it...",3,2,1

I've tried every fancy and high priced bougie brush but always come back to this inexpensive but hard working brush. I even found a smaller one to put in my purse. It never tangles my hair wet or dry. It's my HG brush for blow drying no matter if my hair is short or long, I always use this. I had this same brush for almost 30 years.  The rubber on the handle was finally getting sticky so I had to replace it.  Couldn’t believe the exact same one was for sale on Amazon.  Love it so much.  Years ago, my roommate tried to steal it because it is so perfect. I have been using this brush for over 15 years and it is the best for volumizing!  With the vents, your hair dries quickly. I think this is my 5th purchase of this brush! I like to this brush a lot. Just as good as expensive ones. This is the best hairbrush I have found. This is my third order. I bought this brush to dry the hair on the top of my head. It dries really nice, easy to hold. Just a good brush. Dislike its a bit small but I like itI have static in my hair and it’s seems to help This hairbrush has been my favorite for years! So glad it’s still on the market!",3,5,-2

Since becoming a mom a few years ago, I desperately wanted to find a way that I could let my hair air dry without looking like I've electrocuted myself and sent my hair flying wildly. I tried so many products! Mousse, gel, cream, etc. A hairstylist recommended this product to me and it's amazing. Even when I lived in Georgia, I could get out of the shower, put a dime sized amount of this product in my hair, and go. As it air dried, the wavy ringlets formed and stayed. It's been my go-to hair product ever since. A bottle has lasted me almost a year. It really takes a small amount to spread through your hair. I've ordered this and sent it to my sister, too. I have never been able to naturally dry my hair before and not immediately put my hair in a ponytail! And in the summer in Georgia, it's just too hot to blow dry your hair... you come out of the shower and instantly start sweating under the heat of the hair dryer! No thank you. I need to keep things simple.  I recommend this if you have naturally wavy/curly hair and want an easy morning routine. I know some reviewers were complaining because the new packaging specifies that this product is ""light control,"" but this is the same product as ever, just with more specific packaging.  This curling creme is great if you want your curls to be defined but not crunchy.  By the end of the day, you might be getting a little frizz, but it holds pretty well as long as you're not out in the wind or doing something else that's going to muss you up.  The new packaging just helps you to know that if you need your hair to stand up to a stiff wind or a nuclear assault, you probably want to go for one of their stronger-holding products.Not only does this product hold your curl without making your hair heavy or crunchy, but it's got a great smell--it's light and slightly fruity, which I prefer to overly strong or floral.  With only a small dab, my hair smells great and stays tame all day.  I've been buying and using this product for around five years now and have been consistently pleased. When my curly hair was shoulder-length, I would have given this product five stars. Now that it's getting longer, towards the middle of my back, I find this product is too heavy for my hair and causes my curls to droop throughout the day, requiring more frequent washing. I now use Devacurl products exclusively, which don't use silicones like most hair poducts. That said, it was absolutely perfect for my shorter hair, which looked bouncy and springy for days! I would simply apply a generous amount of this product to my hair, scrunch, and let air dry. The next morning I'd have tight, voluminous curls that would last for 3, sometimes 4 days, with only an occasional touch-up of this product. I highly recommend it for shorter-haired curly girls looking for more bounce. Used Curly Sexy Hair for many years. Disappointed since this new formula because of an allergic reaction to whatever they have changed/added. I still have the old tube I should compare the ingredients to see what they changed. However, still the best curl and softest hold. I have not found anything as good to replace it so going without. I received my order for curly sexy ""curling creme"" and the product does not match the picture or description. I've previously purchased this product and rcvd EXACTLY what I ordered.Today I received a ""LIGHT CONTROL"" version of curly sexy - curling creme.I did not know that there were degrees of control..light..medium..etc.I'm hoping that this ""LIGHT CONTROL"" version is the same as versions that I have ordered in the past.Also, I paid $10.77 per bottle - and the invoice says that it's only $8.51 each...?? super soft and perfect for curly hair! Blue tint to it, smaller than expected, and a little more runny rather than if you got it at a beauty store. Works exactly the same! not my favorite cream for curly hair but definitely one of the top ones! My boys got perms and have been using this product for the past 3 months. They really like the way it makes their curls hold but are not left crunchy.We are on our second tube with using about a nickle size, almost every day for 3 months, on top of two boys' heads. (For an approximate idea of how long a tube might last) Overtime, my hair has thinned out pretty badly. It used to have a real nice natural wave in it, but because it has mostly fallen out, it looks very thin. However when I use this product and scrunch my hair it looks a lot thicker! Highly recommended, happy customer.",4,5,-1

Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream Face Wash, Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment for Acne-Prone Skin, 6 fl. oz (Pack of 3)","I like the product. However, they were supplied with a short expiry of about four months, which I think is not fair given the quantity purchased. I once randomly saw this suggested by a youtuber who raved about it so I decided to give it a try. Every other face wash I tried irritated my rosacea and dried out my skin. I was thrilled with this from the first time I tried it. It's gentle, smells nice and doesn't irritate or dry out my skin at all. I haven't used any other face wash since I started using it roughly 12 years ago, and since my kids have been old enough to use face wash, they've also used only this. It's a keeper! My wife will buy and use this product every day. As husband to a beautiful woman I will buy the 3 pack, save money, and everyone is happy! The photo and price would imply this is a three pack but you only get one bottle. Great product but way cheaper elsewhere. Should have read more carefully! This facewash feels amazing on your face. It’s so refreshing. I have been using the Neutrogena 3 in 1 for most of my life but unfortunately it looks like it got discontinued. This stress control cream seems to clear up acne and clean up my skin just like its 3 in 1 that they use to have. I will keep using this for my acne. Love this product, however it is advertised as 3 bottles and I only received one. Amazon sent me a refund, but just want to give a heads up to anyone else. Let me just say that I love this product. I have naturally oilly skin, especially with wearing a mask at work for 9+hours. I tend to breakout in the standard problem areas, but using this product twice a day does the trick for me. I typically buy this at Walmart, but decided to try and order on Amazon for ease of it being delivered to my door. When I opened the package, I had the product I ordered, however I did not have the quantity I paid for. I paid for three 6oz bottles, and only received one. This is quite unfortunate as I love the product but received less than half of what I ordered. Will be sticking to buying this product in person, or 1 bottle at a time going forward.",4,4,0

cannot describe smell thoughi definitely recommend product,Dabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil 300ml (Pack of 2 Bottles),"I purchased this oil from SimplyBeautiful via Amazon over the summer. It is now October, and I must say that I have seen major growth. I have natural, colored (deep red), 3C hair. I massage this oil into my scalp so that the herbs infused into the oil penetrate, and I massage it into the length of my hair. I do this about once or twice a week, usually once. I also use this oil as a deep conditioner before washing my hair. I have gone from just below arm pit length to bra strap length since the use of this oil (over a span of 4 months)I know that it is this oil because since using it I have less breakage and shedding (coconut oil and the herbs in this particular brand help to prevent protein loss from handling and washing), thus helping me to retain length. My hair is stronger and longer, I could not be any happier. Another thing worth mentioning is that my growth rate had nearly doubled by the second month of use. In the first month it was my normal rate of half an inch, by the second month and beyond, my hair has grown nearly an inch every month. Faithful use of this oil has also softened my hair up. I used to have dry-ish and frizzy hair, but now my hair is super soft and I have silky curls with less frizz. Using this product to seal in leave in conditioners also helps when wearing wash and gos or even protective styles.There are people who complain about the smell, but I think that's a petty complaint considering what this oil does. It's natural, packed full of herbs and nutrients, and it does what it says. The smell is a herbal, earthy smell. It dissipates after settling into your hair. I actually like it. The consistency is that of coconut oil. When it gets too hard to pour out of the bottle (because the room was cold, like with regular coconut oil) I just put it in a bowl of warm water or carry it with me into the shower. Such an easy fix. I do not recommend microwaving it because that literally nukes the nutrients within the oil and renders them less effective, just like microwaving vegetables.I would recommend this oil to all hair types. Finer, limper textures just need to use less than someone with less fine, kinky, curly, dense, etc. hair. One bottle lasts a long time. I do also use this on my face and my complexion is so much more glowy. I also use it to ward off the effects of aging (I'm only 18, but the way you treat your skin now is the skin you'll have later).I love this oil and I will use it for the rest of my life, no doubt!Also a note on the service of the vendor: I have not had any problems when ordering from this vendor. I received my oil very quickly and in tact. I was very happy with the level of service. :) Life saver for thin, brittle and chemical maintained African American hair. I use to need a perm/touch up every 3 months faithfully. I was recommended by an Indian woman to purchase what her family has used for years. I am so thankful for her advise. My hair has never been this healthy, strong, and long in YEARS. I will continue to use this product as long as they are producing it. In an applicator bottle I combine the Vatika (it is very greasy, so only apply a dab to scalp), Neem, castor, olive, and other essential oils; I apply this mixture to my hair every other day (T cross over the scalp, apply more to damaged areas). NOTE: If you do work out, the smell of the oils and your sweaty scalp will not be pretty lol. Be sure to only put the oil on AFTER a planned workout or before a wash. Im rockin a fro and I run this through my hair every so often after a steamy shower in which my fro has gone through a mini aquatic waterfall. Anyway it smells pretty good and it makes my hair kinda shiny and for a while you can see tiny lil shiny balls inside my hair. It goes away as it seeps in but when shining perfectly in the sun I feel the soul glo. If I have too much on my hands there's no problem with  wiping it all over my black man chest because you can use it on your skin too, your hair will treat you real good. I went to get my hair braided and they lady said in her African voice ""yoour hear is very soft"" and I said in my JJ walker voice  ""I knoooooow""over all its great for hair and skin use, Only thing you need to watch out for is if you leave it out in cool setting (not even cold) it will leave its liquid state and go into a kind of cream state. if you put it under hot water it will go back to oily except for the very top of the bottle where the cap is. If you try to squeeze it to force it out the top may pop off and spray you and the mirror in the bathroom (not that this has happened to me!) I would buy this again,I had to add this update because people keep saying something smells good and they get near me to tell me its my hair. They ask me what I put in it. Some believe me when I say its just the sweat from my scalp and I tell others if I remember the name.....I think I've told some people its coconut oil called vajita. I'm so off but it really does work well in my fro and if I have too much on my hand I just rub it anywhere on me and that's cool too cause its cool.",4,5,-1

struggling with dandruff sipnce puberty, in my late 20s I found out it is caused by seborrheic dermatitis. The doctor was of no help, besides a diagnosis. I've used many dandruff shampoos since I was a child. In my middle 20s it got worse and went from flakes to an itchy, red crust on my scalp. I still get flakes too but I got this severe issue. Dandruff shampoos do treat seborrheic dermatitis, but when my condition got worse it got harder to control. Also a lot of dandruff shampoos seem harsh on hair. This shampoo is actually sulfate-free and gentle on hair. Maybe too gentle, it doesn't seem to cleanse well so I also use another shampoo also.The salicylic acid in this exfoliates flakes and crust, sulfur kills the fungus on the scalp that causes dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis (most dandruff shampoo ingredients are antifungals) as does the tea tree oil, and the camphor and menthol can reduce itch. Keep in mind the tea tree oil, camphor and menthol could all irritate skin if you have very sensitive skin, I have sensitive skin and this doesn't seem to irritate it but these ingredients are all potential irritants. They do serve a purpose in this shampoo, and most people should tolerate it fine.You do have to leave it in a few minutes and allow it to work. I don't like that it doesn't foam since you have to use a lot of it to get it through your hair and scalp. The smell isn't strong. It isn't fragranced, which I prefer since fragrance irritates my skin, so it won't smell like roses. A tip for you, if you have bad scalp itch consider dropping products with fragrances. Fragrance chemicals can irritate skin and cause itching, and a lot of hair products are heavily fragranced.I find this good for my dandruff shampoo. I've been using it a few years. It doesn't damage my dry curly hair, it doesn't irritate my skin like many dandruff shampoos do, and it works for me unlike most dandruff shampoos. Personally I have also found it necessary to apply Dermarest psoriasis gel to my scalp after shampooing, it has salicylic acid and a zinc ingredient that both benefit my condition. Between the two products my flakes and crust stay gone for 24 hours. The product did help to clear up some of the dandruff on my scalp. I loved the cooling sensation that it gives when it settles on the scalp. However, I did notice that flakes would come bk within a few days to a week after shampooing..so only this was the disappointment I was really hesitant after reading the mixed reviews. Some said it didn't work; some said it did; some really complained about an obnoxious foul/medicinal stench.First off a summary of my review:- Individual with seborrheic dermatitis as a result of hair color treatment with excessive dandruff and plaque, peeling, flaking, and fiery itchy burn.- Apply said all natural product whose scent is on par with that of Selsum Blue, but with significant less foaming/sudsing (image using 3 times the dollop size you typically use with your regular commercialized shampoo)- Said all natural product alleviate and eliminated color-treated scalp condition and improved condition equal to and above pre-color treated scalp condition; however, did not completely eliminate (but did alleviate) peripheral conditions as a result of scalp condition.- Result: I'm a fan! Thanks for fixing my scalp and making me and my home and all around me better and happier.A little history abt my problem:I typically use Head & Shoulders Ocean Lift or Refresh as I suffer from frequent dandruff and mild scalp itchiness. Overall it was kind of a hit or miss affair with dandruff. As I got older, I started coloring my hair more to cover my premature grays. Over the span of 18-24 months of monthly/every touch ups and semi-annual full color treatments, my dandruff gradually went from sometimes to frequently to incessant. My scalp started itching at all hours and I could feel a fiery burn where there was the most dandruff and itchiness. The back of my ears (where my glasses go behind my ear all & all the way past that to my lobe where earrings go) became scaly [plaque is the medical term], lightly pus/moistened (like it felt slick & wet but didn't feel oily, and smelled like pus) and smelled infected.The regular use of my Head & Shoulders shampoo felt great and stopped the burning itch... until my hair/scalp was dry and no longer wet from washing and then - voila, return of the fiery burning flaking itch!  Some times, my hair would be wet, but scalp had dried and the burn was back!  It was so bad, I started waking up aware that I had subconsciously scratched and peeled my scalp and back of ears bloody in my sleep and the skin was still flaking off! I started noticing my outer ear canal also starting to flake and peel. Sounds disgusting right? I was desperate to rectify the situation!  I have since gone au naturale - beauty is not worth the horrible flaking, burning and (what felt like) spreading skin condition and the flaking/scratching/shedding everywhere.Search for a cure/relief:I attempted to try a tea tree oil, plantain oil infused scalp spray; frangipani and then a morrocan oil treatment - none of them worked too well. As soon as my scalp dried after these treatments, it went right back to fiery burning please-rip-the-skin-off-so-it-won't-burn-and-itch-no-more supreme discomfort.  I think they had a very minimal effect, but not enough to alleviate my condition in any sense.I asked my primary care physician what could be done to alleviate the feeling and useless doctor that they were diagnosed it as seborrheic dermatitis and said there really isn't any remedy other than frequent cleaning and moisturizing.  If and when I develop bloody, pus-filled sores and wounds, then they'd be able to help. So I was thinking OMG, great, now which of the million products on the market will truly clean (without over-stripping) and moisturize my poor scalp??  I certainly didn't want to ever get to that crazy bloody skin-rotting-looking stage!!!Finding JASON Natural Cosmetics Dandruff Relief Shampoo [Rosemary, Neem, Tea Tree 12oz]:Desperately searching the market for a natural shampoo with sulfur (which something about hair color treatments strip from your head), tea-tree or other natural recommended moisturizing oils, and other wholesome goodness (because I wasn't having any luck with the products from Sally's, Walmart, Target, Whole Foods), I stumbled upon Jason Natural Costemics Dandruff Relief Shampoo on Amazon.  Two uses of this shampoo STOPPED the burning and excess flaking and scaliness of my scalp and helped alleviate some of the burning feeling also on the back of my ears.This is not to say this product is a miracle shampoo; I still have some mild itchiness at the places were I had the worse case of burning/itchiness and depending on how much I sweated during the recent heat waves, I had buildup and plaque (which of course scratchy fingers that they are now accustomed scratched off) , but it is back to a very, very mild and privately manageable level.  No more embarrassing giant flakes, no more shedding as I turned my head, no more burning, no more wake up in the middle of the night with my pillow covered in little/big/round flakes, no more blood under my fingernails, and no visible shedding everywhere!  I can actually toss my hair now and not expect to see GIANT flakes (as extreme as say, pieces as wide as my pinky nail) fall on my desk, arms and shoulders.  Prior to the exacerbation from the color treatments, my scalp (especially the hairline near my forehead) would be visibly flake-y and would occasionally fall off onto my shoulders and desk by itself or when I rubbed my forehead.  Now no flakes fall unless I choose to put my nails to my scalp and scratch it off myself; heck, since there's not even the slightest irritation, there really isn't even that anymore!My ears are still itchy, the plaque (flakiness/peeling) is still present, the inside of my ears still get a bit of flaky build-up, but the condition overall is vastly improved (especially the scalp!!!) compared to where it was before I started using this product.  I find the use of my conditioner tends to make my scalp itchier than when I just cut it out or use the all natural tea tree oil spray conditioner. I've started mixing JASON shampoo treatments in between my Head & Shoulder shampoo (as JASON is very low-suds and I find I have to use more than a quarter-sized dollop to get it spread/suds up my scalp & hair) and once you get used to JASON you'll be surprised how even 1/3 of the amount of your regular shampoo (in my case, H&S) is like 10x foamier than JASON.  Also the smell? I have used Selsum Blue and it smells similar to Selsum Blue people; actually Selsum Blue smells stronger than this does. It makes me wonder if the people complaining about the smell ever even used Selsum Blue because if they had they wouldn't complain about how ""bad"" it smelled.  Personally I think it smells fine. I've used Jason dandruff shampoo for probably 15 years. It's still the best for preventing flaking on my head - and from my beard, so I use it there too!The old bottles were narrow and wide, out of a thicker material than this new one. This one is thinner (better for the environment, probably) but it's so hard to get the shampoo out now. It would have been better in a tube, but this in-between form factor and deflection is terrible.I'm a man with large, strong hands, and it's inconvenient. Someone with arthritis would have serious trouble. And that's when it's full...I don't look forward to getting the second half of the bottle's contents out!- Erick The Reviewer",2,2,0

I’ve had bad outcomes in expensive salons, where my highlights have been orange or white so I figured doing it myself was pretty high risk. Guess what? I got perfect highlights! To be honest: It was an involved, difficult, and very fiddly process. The cap - at first I didn’t understand how the holes worked, because they don’t go all the way through. Pro tip: you have to poke the holes through yourself. And then it was hard to pull hair through with the crochet hooks. And the distribution of highlights using the holes wasn’t really correct. I did have to touch it up afterward with a few hand-painted foils (maybe 10 or 15). Still, I got really gorgeous highlights, some of the best I’ve ever had, by myself, at home, for 10 bucks, and all in about 45 minutes instead of in about three hours at the salon. Thank you, coronavirus: I will be doing my highlights at home from now on and saving $500 a year! This was my quarantine self highlight. I was kind of annoyed while I was using it because of the time it takes (it made me really appreciate my hair colorist). However, the end results crazy awesome. I mean not as good as my $200-300 professional highlight, but for under $15 bucks I am amazed at how well it came out in the end. I used the smaller metal hook for “baby lights” ( some highlights were still a bit chunkier than I would I like.) The trick is to get lots and lots of small  pulls of hair through the cap. Next time, depending on how long quarantine lasts, I think I could do a better job. Saved one packet of bleach for later to do some balayage (lots of YouTube’s on how to do this). I didn’t notice any noticeable difference from the blue toner. It’s not a proper toner like you would get from the store it’s more like a purple rinse. If you want a proper toner skip this one and buy a proper one. I really was hesitant about purchasing a highlighter kit in a box, but was fed up with paying $100 at the salon and not really being happy with the results. Although I was apprehensive, I gave it a try, and was amazed with the results. This kit beats out any other highlighting kit out there. For one thing, they give you enough of everything you need (I have long hair), there was no brassiness in the outcome, and it was so easy to use. I will definitely be buying this again when I need a touch up. It did what it was supposed to do but it is like any other hair dye it's a pain in the rear trying to get it somewhat even First time doing an at home highlight.  My husband did it for me and I have to say, it turned out perfect.  I will buy this product over and over again and never overpay for highlights at the salon again.  Color is great and product was easy to use I had not used a highlighting kit in years.  But with the coved-19 virus, I no longer had access to my hairdresser.  The order arrived very fast.  The directions were easy to follow, and it was very easy!  I love the color of my highlights.  It turned out really pretty.  I was impressed! Loved the highlight kit. It was a bit hard to pull long hair through. Final results were way better than expected. Will absolutely purchase again. Saved a lot of money doing it myself. Have red hair and other than going to a salon this is the only product I've found that will take my hair to blonde all the way without stopping at freaking orange lol, love it!!!",1,4,-3

Nothing has been helping the dryness the day after I wash my hair. I’ve used this stuff 1 time and I can already feel a difference! It’s so soft and way less frizz. The smell is a bit like a used car salesman Cologne but it’s subtle once it dries so it doesn’t bother me. Just spray onto your hair when wet and then style as you want and end up with thicker hair then you normally have Wow, I love the scent of CHI and I ordered this for the first time. LOVE it and it really works! Pros:1. This is a larger bottle than I thought it would be. I can tell that it will last a least a few months even if I use it daily.2. Smells nice. It's not perfumey but has a pleasant, light scent that dissipates quickly.3. I can apply this to my hair after a wash & nothing else and get immediate softening. No need to apply any other leave-ins. So it's great for that emergency wash-n-go.4. Doesn't take much on damp hair. I just spritzed top, sides, and back and fluffed in with my fingers and let it dry.5. It makes a nice refresher for hair that dries out in between washing/conditioning.6. Gets rid of the ""crunch"" left by gels, etc. (I like to use a curl gel but it leaves my hair hard! This softened that up a lot.)Cons:1. This affects curl definition. When I use on wet hair pre-styling (twisting, etc,) it let my hair much too soft and moisturized for the natural pattern to display itself.2. This does loosen curls quite a bit. When I washed my hair again & did not apply this, my curl definition was back but looser. (However, I also recently used a henna coloring so that could be part of it.)3. I think that using this over time - even without applying heat - would really loosen the natural curl pattern.In my opinion, this would be a great product for non-afro/Caucasian type hair without any heat or styling. It's a nice, misty refresher to tame flyaways and ends. I'm not sure that it would work the same for permed or pressed afro-hair because it might reverse the effects.So this is iffy for me. I love the softness but I don't want to ruin my curl pattern. I can't find any information about whether regular or long-term use would cause that. In the meantime, I do love this for when I need to wash and go. Otherwise, I would have to apply a couple of moisturizing products to avoid hard or crunchy-feeling hair.I think I need to find something that softens this well but won't affect the afro-curl pattern. I am pleased with the product results. Unfortunately, the scent is awful. Very sweet chemical (defiantly chemical) smell. It's a shame it stinks like really cheap perfume. The good news is the smell does not last on your hair, just hold your breath and step away from the spot you stood in when applying. Otherwise, it is a good product. Has really helped boost and smooth my fine and easily tangled hair. I’ve been purchasing this for quite a while now as Chi products work very well for my hair. The scent is wonderful too! It’s not too strong  but nice and clean smelling. I use it everyday too. It’s also not over conditioning either and I have curly hair. I use this every single day whether I’m wearing my hair naturally curly or before blowing it dry and straightening it. I do have naturally curly hair but it’s more of a curly/wavy. I do not have tight curls. I have normal to dry hair and have it cut into a short bob right now. However I started purchasing this when my hair was very long and it works well on all of it.

I needed a deep conditioning treatment and had tried so many other different products only to be left wanting more. A friend of mine let me borrow her tub and all it took was a five minute treatment in the shower and I was a believer. I immediately came and ordered my own. My hair is always super shiny, soft and my waves/curls are very well-defined and well-behaved whenever I use this product. I leave it on overnight and then rinse it out in the morning and let my hair air dry with no product in it. The smell takes a little bit getting used to but it is definitely worth it. It is not nauseatingly bad but it is really strong and it does linger in your hair even after it is dry. I can't describe the smell other than saying it is very earthy. The scent is the only downside that someone could potentially find. And for the price it is well worth it. I have purchased Kerastase, phyto, Redken, living proof etc etc products that did not do for my hair what this did. I don't know if I would go as far as calling it holy grail because my hair still has a little bit of frizz and could use a bit more moisture but it is definitely heavily-used in my rotation My hair is more soft and moisturizing Salerm Wheat Germ Mask is definitely one of my holy grail treatment masks! I can't express how amazing this treatment is for my hair. I'd been without it for a few months now and I could totally tell the difference in my hair after just one use. My hair is normally dry but this product definitely combats that. The mask leaves your hair silky, shiny, and strengthened. It really does make my hair stronger and it just gets better with every use! I also love the scent! It's an amazing aroma that does linger well after the conditioning process is completed. The product rinses clean with no remaining buildup or heavy ingredients that will weigh the hair down. My hair is left shiny, with lots of body and movement. Each hair strand looks so much better with the addition of this mask, which really does make my hair healthy! Again, definitely a holy grail product for me forever! Next time, I'll order the large size which is a much better value for the money and the consistency with which I use the product.Also, kudos to the seller! The product arrived a day earlier than estimated and was in great shipping condition! I will definitely order from them again!",4,4,0

I have used it for years. this is no hype.  The consistency is perfect.  The shampoo goes where you want it.  I have been using thisproduct for over three years.  It is just now I am buying it at a much better price with Amazon.  I am a veryhard grader. CHANGING SHAMPOOS IS ESSENTIAL OVER TIME. BUT THERE ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY TYPES AND SO MANY BRANDS,THAT IT BECOMES MIND BOGGLING WHEN YOU LOOK FOR A NEW SHAMPOO{LIKE THE SHAMPOO N CONDITIONER IN ONE BOTTLE}. SPIED THIS GREAT BARGIN ON AMAZON.COM. SOUNDED GOOD,THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT. WHAT A GOOD CHOICE!!!!! MY HAIR WAS SO SILKY FEELING,AFEELING OF COMFORT. NO 4 MINUTE WAIT FOR A CONDITIONER TO ""FIX"" YOUR HAIR. AM SO PLEASED WITH THIS CHOICE{I AM THE WIFE}. WORD OF CAUTION: MENS SHAMPOO DOES NOT DO WELL FOR LADIES FINE HAIR. I'm an adult male. I ran across this shampoo in a toiletry package in a hotel.  I used it and was pretty surprised at what it did: I was able to comb my hair without having to plaster it down to make it manageable. My hair is pretty tough and unruly and hard to comb but this shampoo/conditioner combo worked exceedingly well without having to soak in a separate conditioner. Hair was clean and soft.  I recommend this shampoo! I was despondent when Pantene changed their formula, years and years ago.  Apparently I wasn't the only one, because they introduced the ""Classic"" line shortly after.  There have been variations in packaging and naming, but this is the stuff.  I absolutely hate it when I have to use something, especially hotel shampoo.  I've tried some high-end stuff, some which is pretty good, but they're literally 3 or 4 times the price of Pantene. Grew up using Pantene and still do to this day. From my experience, it's great for normal and thick hair types but not so much for those with fine hair, as I've heard some fine haired peeps complain about losing random hairs from it. I ordered this Pantene product for my sister who is currently in a Rehab. center.  She told me her hair was becoming dull and very brittle.  She used this product for one week then called me with her thoughts.  She loved it and said her hair was back on track and very healthy again.  I use Pantene myself and love it.  I was very happy that she was happy.  Would certainly recommend to others. Good shampoo. I like that it does not take much to do its work.",3,5,-2

This one smells good and has great hold. I love this product. It’s light wt, nice scent, & provides great volume & body for baby fine hair. To nvr run out, I adv order backups. This item arrived with the spray-cap tilted in its seating, which I didn’t see until I removed the plastic sealing to begin using it;… now way past the 30-day return window. While I tried to use it, the cap was hard to press; then, the cap & the plastic delivery tube entirely snapped off. Unable to interchangeably use the spray cap off the previous can, I am left with the entire contents of a brand new can of this wonderful hair spray; unable to return OR McGyver the cap into use. If you buy in adv like me, just mk to sure to remove plastic seal & check out the spray-cap right away. If you want an awesome spray buy it This is by far the best hairspray I have ever used. Amazing hold without making your hair hard and brittle I absolutely love this hair spray.  It keeps my hair in place without feeling heavy.  But the sprayer clogs often and once in a while I purchase a can and it breaks after a few weeks.  Please fix your sprayer problem.  Lots of people write about it.  Please hear us. I do love this hairspray, but wish it was a little cheaper. It's not sticky and it doesn't have a heavy smell. I have used Kenra working spray in the past but bought this in the absence of a shortage from my usual source.  As a working spray to be used while styling the hair, it really is the best I've found.  When using with my curling iron, I first spritz some hair protectant, then add a spray of this product along the length of the hair to the end before putting the wand on my hair.  I have hard-to-curl hair so I hold it in a full 30 seconds per section and it adds nice volume and bounce.  Once I have combed/brushed to the desired style, I add a spray again and it is more than enough to hold a bouncy, volumous style for the day.  Be aware that if you use it on Day 2, the build-up from the previous day can be slightly flaky.  On the downside, it is probably one of the worst scents I have used.  It smells like the bug spray you would use around your home.  It does seem much worse when initially spraying and lightens up once dried. I really like this spray. I've ordered it a few times. It's a big can, so lasts a while. I have fairly thin hair and it's hard to hold and I live in Florida, where it's just too humid, so decent hairspray is important. I use this when I'm done styling my hair. I can spray my hair and still move it around a little bit if I want to. My hair being hard to hold, I need more than this spray, so after I have it how I want it with this spray, I use a finishing spray over that, because this spray is not a strong enough hold for my hair type and for the humid Florida weather.Just wanted to add an update:I've used this hairspray for years, since my original review was from 3 years ago... the current can that I have clogged and I have about 75% of the product left. Very annoying. My typical return time was over, but I contacted Amazon anyway to see if they would do anything for me. It's $20 hairspray, I hate to throw out 75% of the product. They are actually sending me a replacement which I appreciate very much. Kudos to Amazon for taking care of their customers and I'll store the new can upside down.  If you remember to store your cans upside down, they shouldn't clog.",3,5,-2

1875 Watt Cord Keeper Hair Dryer, Purple","I had this for almost 2 years & I still love it! The cord still retracts like the day I first got it. Just retract slowly & carefully. I love that it has 3 temperature settings & also a low & high mode. No complaints :) Wow, this is really a great hair dryer! Before this I was using a similar Conair unit with Cool/Low/High heat and Low/High speed settings, a cold shot button, a retractable cord reel and a diffuser attachment. However it is a few years old now. I recently repaired a short that was in the cord that developed after years of use. Thankfully it was very close to the plug and only reduced the cord length by a few inches. The older one is still unpleasantly loud on high though, and I was having to use earplugs while drying my hair just to keep the noise out. I'm very finicky about my hearing and didn't want to hold something next to my head for 20 min a day that was going to slowly destroy that and annoy me in the present.The cord reel was a must-have option for me, as was the diffuser attachment since I have naturally curly hair and like to style it that way. I also like that this dryer has Tourmaline. I'm not sure whether my older unit had it, but it doesn't seem so. This dryer definitely gets the job done faster, with MUCH less noise on high that is easily tolerated comfortably sans earplugs, which was a high priority. The heat is nice too, and though I believe it has a slightly lower temperature than my older unit, it's more than adequate. I also love that it doesn't get hot except at the business end. Sometimes I like to hold the dryer from the barrel and it doesn't even get slightly warm. The cold shot button is a nice feature too which I seldom use, but it's nice to have. I think the cord is a bit longer as well. While I would have preferred rocker switches, the slider switches are simple and solid. The styling of this dryer is SUPER CUTE haha! Though it's plastic, I love the metallic fuchsia finish and the sporty modern detailing. I know at least one other reviewer complained about it not having a loop to hang the dryer from, which I agree should probably be a feature on every hair dryer ever made everywhere, but I will upload a user photo later showing how I hang my dryer on the wall using a brass hook, which works just fine. I would rather not have to put stress on the cord by hanging it from the plug body, but I believe since it doesn't bend the cord, and the dryer is lightweight, that stress would be minimal if not negligible. One could probably rig some kind of keyring zip tied around the flared fitting that guides the cord into the dryer body if you must have something to hang it from, but I found it unnecessary for my setup. Did I mention that it makes my hair look fabulous too? Even without product, it does an excellent job of getting my hair dry, voluminous, and shiny with minimal disturbance and frizz, which as a curly girl is always an issue. The price is also unbeatable @ $20 with free shipping. I saw this same dryer in Ulta, Sears, BB&B, etc. for twice the price, plus tax. I've only owned the product for a couple weeks, but I expect it to last for years just like my other Conair, which is now going into the guest bathroom or into my luggage as a travel dryer. At this price however, I may consider buying a 2nd. I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who needs a fabulous, quiet, affordable, space & time saving hair dryer loaded with features. The dryer is very nice. Feels solid. I was specifically looking for one with a retractable cord. This one works nicely. There may be others with a longer cord (this is about the length of my arms spread out, from one hand to the other) but this is length is fine for my bathroom based on where the outlet is in relation to the mirror. Make sure to hold onto the plug when you press the button to retract the cord because it will flap around quickly and could smack you in the hand.The blower could be a little more powerful and I dont see a huge difference between the medium and full settings (the difference is slight) but on the medium heat setting the blower is a bit more powerful. Thats the tradeoff - slightly more blower strength vs slightly more heat. There are 3 settings overall. Lastly, there are undoubtedly lighter models but this one is well balanced so the extra weight isnt that bad to deal with (unless you have A LOT of hair and it would take you a long time to dry ... Your arm might get a bit tired). But like I said, that does give a ""solid"" feel to it. It's not a travel model so best left in your bathroom at home. With all that,  I'm still pretty happy with it overall. The slide switches in the pistol grip are easy to use and well positioned for one hand operation. And I can hold the handle in one hand, press the retractable cord button with that thumb while holding the plug with the other hand. Some people may find it's faults outweigh its pluses but they're not deal breakers for me. A solid buy for the price. I would recommend it. My old Conair finally bit the dust, had it for approximately 20 + years.Love this one retractable cord is great, Three heat settings and three air settings. Comes in different colors,I bought purple 💜 my favorite color. Was surprised at the cost extremely reasonable given how long I had the other Conair. It's a keeper.",5,5,0

These are great! They are just a bit smaller than the ones I use at home. I’ll alternate between this and curling wand. They heat very quickly. I’m very satisfied with my purchase. Getting ready in the morning. I blow dry  my hair and just put a few of these in for 3-4 minutes , and done. Bought these for traveling but actually use them for everyday. They don’t feel like they are really hot but they curl really good. They are lighter than the old ones. Still works well in my hair. I like how compact it is, the curlers secure with the provided ""clips"". I wish the pocket for the clips was on the exterior of the pouch and the pouch itself was a little more sturdy to hold the heat.  My curls turned out beautiful - so overall happy with it. This set has enough curlers to make my lob (very fine hair) look like a big blow out by the time I've drunk my coffee. Super portable and easy to use. Trusted brand.  I like the compact size of set.  I plan to use when traveling.  I wish there had been 3 sizes of rollers instead of just 2.  I needed a few of larger diameter.  I should have read product description more closely before ordering. Good size for travel",4,5,-1

It tends to be windy here too. Makes for some awful hair days!  The minute I step out of the bathroom my hair style starts to fall loose and become frizzy. I have fine hair, colored light red to cover graying, greys are getting a coarse texture, and it went from stick-straight a few years ago to different size waves all over except the bangs. Breaks more easily now too. Anyway, I’m impressed with the humidity resistance of this spray as well as wind resistance. I can also nap and my style doesn’t get smooshed on one side. Cuts down on having to fiddle with it all day. I’m considering trying the restructuring shampoo/conditioner/treatment to add strength. But for now, this spray is a definite winner!  My hair moves without feeling stiff or crunchy too! Great job, Kenra!EDIT:  Been about a week since purchasing and noticed my hair had become dull, dry, and lifeless from buildup.  Had to detox my hair with an apple cider vinegar/water rinse. It helped, but I’m going back to my old standby (rhymes with “Mess-Away”) anti humidity hairspray and saving this Kenra for the super humid and/or windy days.  I should’ve known, if the label says “volume”, it will open the cuticle and leave it prone to deposits and dullness. I don’t hate the product, because it def does as it claims. If your hair is already super healthy I say get this spray if you live in a humid environment. If your hair is fine and breakage prone or chemically treated, please use sparingly! I have used Kenra hairspray long enough that when I started using it you couldn't get it except at a beauty supply store.  I love the light scent.  I am very ""scent sensitive"" and this really is great.  Holds well.  It is pricey but I am finding that I actually use less of it than I would with a cheaper brand.  So, all in all, it's a winner!! So this stuff is max hold and amazing smell. I love it and am impressed with the quality. I purchased on recommendation from Blowout Professor on YouTube. It's a little pricey but worth it. Super happy with this hairspray. This is my second time buying it and I had my first bottle for about 3 months. It works very well- I’m able to curl my hair and have the curls stay with this spray for days! Before using this spray my curls would fall out after a day. I will continue to buy this product. This is my favorite hair spray to use.  My hair has it's own agenda sometimes after I style it.  I use this to keep my hair in place and it's lightweight enough to make me NOT look like I am wearing a stiff helmet. This hair spray works very very well!  Holds my hair as it says it will. It is very good. Very little smell so it doesn’t interfere with your parefume!  They do a great job with it!  You will be glad you tried it. With Amazon you can’t go wrong?! Drys fast, doesn't flake, even if I spray too much.  Kenra holds great, lasts all day! It’s a great product for sure, you have the best prices for this volume spray!",2,2,0

I mix with the the Garnier Dream curls cream and let my hair air dry. Keeps my hair from frizzing up and keeps it laying down instead of being all over the place, which is what I prefer. Smells nice and it makes curls defined. This is a great throwback product. It keeps my natural hair moisterized. Also it has a great slip through effect. Learn to use this & you will LOVE it.This is good for almost any type of natural hair. I have naturally curly dry hair that I just did a BIG chop on. I need the curl boost and the moisture.And don't worry about leaving behind big grease stains on furniture! Use this on WET hair or at least damp hair. Whenever I try using it on dry hair, it turns white and stays really wet/greasy. Wetting my hair - even with a spritzing bottle - is what makes this product magical. The wet hair absorbs the product and you end up with soft curls & ZERO crunch. You get the opposite of crunch: shiny & beautifully moisturized hair.Now if you use too much... watch out! Be prepared to either try sopping some of this out with a towel or just washing it out and starting over. Treat apply this the way you should cut hair - start small because you can always add more.The very best thing is that this does dry down a but. At first, it might feel too wet and untouchable but. if you didn't go overboard, it should start calming down after about 15 minutes. The longer your hair, the longer the dry down time. Once it does dry down, you will feel a VERY slight waxiness on your fingertips after touching your hair. It does not transfer to fabrics or paperwork once it is at this point.If you do have longer hair or like really elongated curls, keep in mind that this helps hair to curl. You might lose some elongation but you could probably stretch the curls with your hands or a comb.I alternate using this and Sof Sheen's spray. The spray has a lot of lanolin and I have to give my skin a break from it sometimes. Both of these are the best softening/moisturizing products but this one is for curl-boosting. I have used this product for many years love the way it works. I have used this product for years and fine it to be a great product. Its works great for me i have used this product for years I enjoy using this on my natural 4abc natural curly and oily hair. I use this product with my brush and and keeps my hair moisturized for 3-4 days and then repeat. Lastly, I do not experience build up with this product.",5,5,0

not get tangled easy put take,"Conair Compact Multi-Size Hot Rollers , Coral, 20 Piece Assortment","These are ok. Because I have short hair, I need the smallest size hot rollers available and these, for the most part, work. I have two complaints:1) These do not get hot enough. They get warm but they need to be quite a bit hotter to make the curl last more than 5 minutes. Nobody wants “curling iron” type heat in a roller but after these have been heating for over 10 minutes, I can hold a roller tightly in my hand and barely feel any heat. To get them to work I have to use tons of hairspray as I’m applying the roller to my hair and leave them in for, at the VERY least, 30 minutes. Regular hairspray doesn’t work btw- it has to be a freeze type spray which then makes brushing or combing to style a problem since freeze spray is like dried glue.2) As with all hot rollers the clips are a “J” clip. These things are almost worthless and have not been improved upon in 50 years. I’m 66 and I’ve owned a lot of hot rollers sets over the years & it’s amazing that nothing has been done to improve the way the rollers are held in place. There is however a work-around for the idiotic j clips. Fortunately there are spring loaded claw-clips available on Amazon that keep the rollers secure. Don’t bother buying the cheapest ones since the teeth are thin and snap off. Pay more for the highly rated type (read the reviews) and you can fix the j-clip issue.I have another set of rollers from a different company that do get hot but unfortunately the size prohibits a good wrap (even though the product promised that they work great for short hair.)I did not send these back because I’m desperate enough to keep using them. Side note* I did hair & makeup professionally for magazine photographers and used a lot of hot rollers on models in very unique weather conditions (think Equatorial countries) where the humidity was extreme. I’d have tossed these in a trash can before packing them back in a suitcase to fly them back to the US. If you’re in a humid climate, these will never get hot enough to work the way hot rollers should. I’m in a dry, high-desert and I get them to work.The seller shipped promptly in a typical shipping box. Arrived undamaged. These are quite similar to the old time hot rollers I used as a teen, but the ""teeth"" aren't as long - at least they don't grip the hair very well when trying to roll it. They do get quite hot - especially the end that is on the base unit. If your fingers are sensitive to heat, you will have to move fast. I've found that I have to lay them down for a second try quite often because I think I'm burning my fingers. Definitely remove the clips before plugging it in or they will be super hot also. There are 3 different size rollers with 3 different size clips to hold them in place. I have medium length hair (not quite to my shoulders) and I find that I use all the larger ones & medium ones, but only a few of the smaller. I'll probably wish I'd gotten a set with more larger ones as my hair grows out. While the clips are different sizes they are only faintly different colored tips. I find it helpful to lay them in piles according to their size so I can grasp one quickly after rolling because the roller is so hot you don't want to have to hang on to it very long. There's a light on the front that indicates it is on, but the center roller has a dot on it and when it turns red you know the rollers are hot (obviously the lid needs to be closed to heat up) but it doesn't take very long to heat up. So don't leave it plugged in for a long time. It a nice compact case of rollers with a place for storing the clips, so it could work well for travel, although I have a hot curling brush that I would prefer for traveling. The only reason I don't just use the curling brush is that it requires more time to wrap and then hold the brush while heating the hair to curl. For the price it is adequate. I'd use it exclusively if it wasn't so blasted hot to hold the curlers. this roller set is absolutely amazing. it didn’t take long for the rollers to become hot. i really love the case that the rollers come in because it’s small enough to fit anywhere in the household. the rollers do a great job of holding bouncy curls all day and they also have metal clips for each size roller. i also think these thermal rollers are so much better than the velcro rollers!! i’m pleased to say that this roller set is the best roller set i’ve ever purchased and one of the cheapest as well. I really like these rollers. I like the fact that you get such a variety of sizes. Missing a clip for large roller. I purchased 2 as I have long hair and need the larger rollerx. They are the same as some I had 30+ years ago. They curl well. Not worth the trouble of sending back.",3,3,0

I ""discovered"" this product in college and have been a user ever since (yes, I am old - Gen Xer here). Over the years I have tried other (meaning cheaper) products, but always come back to this one. I had a difficult time finding this during the pandemic, which really did a number on my texture and curl level, but now that it is back in stock my hair is once again loving me back. It looks healthy again, curls beautifully and has stopped shedding. For anyone with curly hair who has never tried this, take a chance. I use it daily as a leave-in conditioner. I damped my hair, use two pumps of this with a squeeze of the Biolage gelee, scrunch it through my hair and let it air dry. Just beautiful!!!  Now if I could just find something non-toxic to tackle the newly present gray.... Having used Humectress since the '80s, here's how I apply it: First, I use a cheap conditioner in the shower just to get out the tangles. Then after toweling my hair off a little, I put a glob of Humectress in the palm of my hand, work it through my hair and LEAVE IT IN. Then, comb and blow dry. Works great for me. For extra shine, I'll add a little hair oil to the glob and mix them together. Hope this helps someone out there! I love this conditioner for my hair. I switched to it when my hair kept falling out. Unfortunately the pump tends to stop working even when it’s still full. But still a good conditioner and lasts forever Thought it would be a better product..doesnt soften as good as cheaper brands I have bought Good sale great brand The product was as described and delivered as promised. Amazon makes everything easy. Love the product but pump broke in package Use it on dry, damaged, colored hair! Cut off the dead hair though!",5,2,3

seed oil woman dry coarse hair lack moisture shine use said see amazing result p also started using aubrey organic white camellia oil shampoo conditioner great,"Oshimatsubaki Camellia Hair Care Oil, 60ml","This Oshima Tsubaki camellia hair oil is fantastic!!!  I am in Love with it, I am a latina with 3a-3b hair, and have a lot of hair! My biggest problem has always been that my hair is dry, no matter all the treatments I made to it.  I also bought lots of ""high-end"" serums, like redken, and paul mitchell to relieve my dry hair and make it shinny but  I always had to reapply often since my hair sucked them up in a minute, and then after a day or two I had a really greasy mess!  No Way, no more serums I said! And I started trying natural oils to see if they made what I was looking for..after using a couple, like coconut, macadamia I really liked them, but wanted something lighter and less greasy that would give me high shine and moisture, until I found this! Camellia Oil!! Yes, Just what I was looking for!!! Camellia oil is very popular in japan, thanks to it's nourishing properties and great quality.  This Oil is lighter than coconut and macadamia, but gives a lot more shine and softness without the greasiness you can get with these others!!  This specific product is 100% pure japan camellia oil, which is great because the best camellia oil is the one from the seeds of camellia flowers in japan , not the camellia from china.  This product is odorless, and a tip I would like to share is to mix it with your favorite essential oil, like lavender or rose,(just a few drops) to have a great smelling hair oil completely natural and safe!!!  I use this Oil after my hair is blow dried ( I don't belive it should be used before, I've learned oil with heat means fried hair! so whatch out! if you blow dry with oil use low heat, if you flat iron your hair, use the oil after not before)  Or when I wont use any heat on my hair, and wear my hair naturally, I will wash my hair, and after the shower put some drops of camellia oil on my damp hair, and let it air dry naturally.  All of these ways work wonders for dry hair, just dont mix oil with high heat, and your hair will be safe.  Also, my hair has grown longer since using this camellia oil, (because my ends dont split like they used to, they are coated and protected in  this healthy oil, and because of this, I can grow it longer without having to cut it every 3 months like I used to, Now I am 6 months till I have my first trim, and my ends are a lot more healty than before) I Highly recomend this Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Seed Oil,  for any women with dry coarse hair, that lacks moisture and shine!  Just use it as I said above, and you'll see the amazing results!!!  p.s. I've also started using Aubrey Organics ""White Camellia Oil shampoo and conditioner"" and they are great too! ;) This is the real deal - correct Camelia type from Japan and a staple for most Japanese households. Yhe price here is excellent and saves me time, gas, etc. This brand is the only one we use and this precious dry oil doubles as a moisturizer, primer, flyaway controller, cuticle oil, nail conditioner, many more uses. Just 4 drops massaged on face,  followed by a spritz of mineral water mixed with a bit of aloe vera juice and a quick dry-off touch with rice paper is a perfect makeup primer. I use more ubder each eye at night and bit more for eyelashes and brows with camphor oil for thickness and growth..I first learned anout it decades ago from my Japonese friend who dragged many bottles back from her visits home between college terms. A bottle is generously sized and lasts almost a year with frequent use if just for face alone. Please note that most brands (even $$$$) sell the wrong genome of camelia grown in China, taking advantage of buyers' ignorance. This brand is gold standard, so don't fall prey to higher prices as a sign of quality.  I am often mistaken for someone a decade or more younger. Although gentics and lifestyle contribute, this inexpensive workhorse for over two decades deserves credit. I've walked off long flights looking as fresh as a daisy (extra oul ro fight dry air, doubled to 10 drops before heading outside in blustery winter cold, always carry a .5oz reusable drop dispenser in my purse and even use as a base for facial exfoliation or a base for face shaving with the longer Japanese blades (best on-going exfoliation around).  Thankfully, Amazon's prices are just a couple of dollars off from my local Japanese store so no need to wait. I vary Amazon vendors, but most ship from Japan.  It is my favorite stocking stuffer and beauty secret (except for telling anyone willing to listen, lol). A drop of rose oil or another fave essential oil kicks it up a notch - I've recommended it as a carrier oil for skin conditions or own-mixed fragrance masterpieces (I love my bergamot/verveter/patchouli 'winter mix'.  So, buy it, you will not be disappointed! For hair 👍 This has become my HG (holy grail) for moisturizing skin.  I apply this as a body oil after a shower.  I pat this on (not slathering) my skin and allow it to dry a bit, and then follow it up w/lotion.  Result:  moisturized skin that lasts!  Thanks to the high oleic acid in this oil, (most compatible w/human skin) it moisturizes the dermal layers on more than just the top level.  I also use this to help soften rough and hardened cuticles (at bedtime) and it's worked like a charm.  I've had no bad reaction to this oil whatsoever.  I didn't find any scent on this, which is good.  As a facial oil, I've noticed the fine lines becoming less and less obvious on my face.  The dry patches I get during winter are gone after 1 use.  I follow this up w/a facial lotion to help seal in the moisture.Ingredient is 100% Camillia seed oil.  I know a higher brand name selling tsubaki oil (camillia seed oil) but it's mixed w/other ingredients.  This Oshima brand is pure and natural.  I'm still on trial and error, when it comes to using this on my hair.  If I put too much, I find that it makes my hair greasy looking (oddly enough it doesn't feel greasy---just looks it).  If I put too little, I have a tendency to overdo it.  Still finding the happy medium.I would highly recommend this multi-purpose oil!",5,5,0

was great my hair was dry damaged couldnt hardly get a brushor comb through it then I tried aphogee it saved my hair I can brush my hair worth ease Excelente The scent is okay. It seems okay with the moisturizing power. The product worked well but based on the condition of your hair you may have to use it more than once to stop the breakage. This first step  of this 2-part system is a stand-alone. I shampoo, towel dry and apply, then dry my hair with a blow dryer. The heat process helps the protein coat, strengthen the hair follicles and correct the pH, smoothing them. I learned about this product about 38 years ago and have been using it ever since! II never color my hair without applying ApHogee first! There is nothing else like t on the market. After it dries in my hair I rinse thoroughly then apply my hair color...or just condition and style. I realized I was almost out of this product and ordered it from Amazon. In the past I just picked it up at the beauty supply store. Amazon shipped it to me so quickly. I was delighted because I was too busy to get to the store! Just don’t expect the small bottle to last long. But it work well. Came wrapped in a plastic bag that was wrapped around the bottle and taped with a sticker. Product smelled and performed like the Aphogee from Sally's Beauty, so happy with purchase. ok so this is part one to this 2 in 1 treatment its amazing...ok so  it smell like fake oranges , sticky ,can sting the scalp sometimes if any abraisons on scalp but stops evetually ,it gets super hard and crunchy but suppose to when completley dry which is exactly what you want completley dry and crunchy  but with all that said its amazing how afterward your hair feels automatically  stronger,healthier and slows or stops breakage however you must buy part 2 of this treatment witch is the balancing moisturizer it is what softens your hair back up to feel like hair once again alone they are both ehhh but together amazing highly reccomend just leave some on shelves for me k I had extremely damaged hair after going from dyed black to brown, (my hair is naturally dark brown, straight, fine and about 50% gray). After color removal and  several bleach treatments my hair was like straw, would not hold color at all, and my only option appeared to cut it all off. After reading about Aphogee Two-step treatment, I felt like this was my last option (before cutting off the damage!)  I had already tried many conditioning treatments with no improvement including K-pak, coconut oil overnight, etc.First, I read up on the application process, as well as all the reviews I could find. I then applied the Aphogee Two-Step with a spray bottle, it is messy and starts hardening in about 5 minutes, so I saturated my hair and then loosely piled it on top on my head, blow dried for 50 minutes until it was hard and seemed as dry as it would get.  Per suggestions from previous reviewers, I reclined in the tub to allow my hardened hair to soften and then showered and rinsed for several minutes. I applied Biolage conditioning balm to my hair for about 5 minutes and rinsed. I added some Its-a-10 and some Fekkai glossing cream.Okay, so after all of this, my hair still looked bad, it was less dry and somewhat healthier looking, but it was not a miracle or dramatic improvement.  I hoped that after coloring it would improve. I waited 24 hours and colored with a non-permanent color, conditioned with Biolage for about 5 minutes, rinsed, towel dried & applied Its-a-10 & fekkai glossing cream.Wow! My hair looked good, it felt soft and held the color.It's been two weeks now and the color still looks great!  There has been a huge improvement and I am very happy that I will not need to cut off all my hair.Some tips:Apply with a spray bottle.Plan beforehand where you will place your hair to ensure that it will completely dry, you cannot move it AT ALL once it dries as it may break off!Wear gloves, the product is sticky and a bit irritating to the skin.I used a hand dryer and it worked great, just plan at least 30 minutes of straight blow drying.Before using, read all the reviews, I found this very helpful.I don't plan on using it again at this time, but if I do, you need to wait 6 weeks between treatments.Make sure to condition afterwards with  a non-protein condition.Only use this if your hair is extremely damaged, it is not for healthy hair.Thanks!",1,3,-2

I have tried the newest & latest & came back to this one. It is lightweight, slim & great for travel & fits great in any travel bag. It gets hot really quickly. It has two sets of teeth,  black ones that stay cool and red ones that heat up, and boy do they heat up!  I have to be careful not to burn my skin, even on the lowest setting. I wear a glove so as not to burn my fingers while wrapping my hair around the barrel. It's a good product,  I think,  but is professional grade which I didn't need.  Live and learn! It’s great for what I need. I broke off quite a few of the prongs after using every day for 2 years and needed to replace it. Ends of hair get Tangled in it very easily I have used this particular curling iron/tool for years. My fear is that someday it will be discontinued because it is the best hair tool I’ve ever had. Yes you do have to learn how to not get it tangled in your hair, just be careful. it is possible to do it without that happening. For those of us who have frizzy hair this is a miracle tool. My only complaint is I want to know where I can buy replacement teeth because they do get tired and they break. If someone could point me in the direction to buy replacement teeth, I would be the happiest person ever. Don’t ever stop making this tool. For all those that are complaining about it, it just takes practice. I’ve been using it for years and I don’t get it stuck in my hair and I don’t burn my hair. You just have to get used to using it. I absolutely love this curling/drying brush. My hair went through a bad perm recently and is wirey. I've tried everything. Because every other bristle line is made of ceramic it soothes out the hair as it heats it. I'm able to go from a fried/dried out looking blonde to a glowed up Marilyn Monroe bouncy, curled look - all in about 15 minutes. It doesn't matter if I wake up with BED HEAD, this baby will come to my rescue. Highly recommended. Heats up very fast.  Like the curls it gives Great product with rechargeable battery a bonus!",1,5,-4

and Aloe Vera Hair Serum for Frizz Control, Shine and Straightening - Coz Love is in the Hair - 2 Fl. Oz, 60 Ml","I received the package on time, opening it was like opening an expensive perfume.The directions said to use very a small amount and I tried it for the first time tonight.As I pumped two small pumps into the palm of my hand rubbed my hands togetherthen applied to my damp newly washed hair, starting with the ends and working my way up to the scalp. Don't put it on your scalp though, it's for your hair.AMAZING SMELL!  It honestly smells like something a movie star would use.So nice!  Anyway, dried my hair and it looks Silky soft, no frizz, and a beautiful shine.Wow, I wish I would have found this a long time ago. (better late than never) I am going to look and see it this brand has shampoo and conditioner now.  Hope this review helps? I have fine - medium hair and a lot of it. It is perfect for me as I live in a humid climate. ................  Sorry about the space there, I was sniffing my hair LOL, it smells so good! Amazing serum! I was struggling with frizzy and even staticky ends. Mrs. Midwest on YouTube recommended this to help with the health of your hair, so I ordered a bottle! Boy, am I glad I did! One or two drops on towel dried hair after the shower leaves the ends smooth. I also use this on days when my hair is a few days “old” and is a little frizzy. I have pretty straight hair, so a little goes a long way. One tiny drop/pump rubbed together on my hands is all I need to put on my hair. Frizz is gone! 10/10 Seems like the product works. I only use a very little bit because I don’t want oily hair and the smell will knock ya on your booty.It smells like old lady perfume roses. My husband said it smells like the stuff nursing homes use to masks the cleaning chemical smell.A small bit goes a long way anyways. I have 4c hair and wanted to touch up my blowout. I live in Florida home of high humidity and this is the only product I’ve ever tried that didn’t frizz or fro me out. Absolutely love this. Some mentioned the smell and I get why some don’t t like it. I personally love it. I use this along with a heat protector spray and my hair looks amazing for at least a week. I even washed my hair myself and used this and got the same flowing results. LOVE IT!!! I'm 62 natural curly hair. Scence moving to Alaska that air is so dry, it makes my hair dry/coarse. 😩 But I found this, I'm in love. Found my hairs best friend so silky and smooth ""instantly"". Wow well worth it, you won't be sorry. I will never be without it. The best moisture without the oilyweight- you know what I mean. I came across a sample I had for 2 of 3 years in one of my drawers. I was about to trash it but decided to try it on my ends, specially  on the highlighted strands. It left my ends soft w/ a nice shine but not greasy which I really liked. Searched first on their website but could not find it but of course later on I found it, where else?  but Amazon!  It’s not exactly the same formulation of the sample but I do like it.  Just be careful for a tiny bit goes a long way.  If you use too much your hair would probably look greasy. I love this product typically. Unfortunately for me when it arrived it had leaked out of the packaging. The product is good just wish I had received allThat I paid for. This product in of itself is the best I've used. Very lightweight and soft and not too greasy. It keeps my wavy hair soft and bouncy throughout the day. The only thing I would change is the smell. It reminds me of an old lady perfume, I would much prefer a scentless option.",5,5,0

I think knowing your hair is important. With that being said I have thick 4C hair. It's super coily and naturally dry. I use this product for curl-defining and for twists, but I always use a liquid leave-in first. This product does not leave any residue, but has a tendency to clump your hair if it is like mine, so it's best to use it after detangling. (It makes for a terrible detangler) This is the only product that leaves my hair soft and moisturized for the longest and like everyone else has said here, a little goes a long way. I love the smell of roses, so no problem there. The only thing I don't like is the price. I like the product bit it made me itch My hair loves Rose H20! It’s been a part of my hair regimen for years. In the last 3-4 years it has been hard to find and now none of the hair salons or hair stores carry it. So I can tell the difference in my scalp. It’s worth the money but I wish it was easier to find and more affordable. ALSO I did not have curly hair. My roots are wavy but I have relaxed hair. I use this product before blowing it out and after. Loves this product. There’s no oily filling and it leaves your hair we’ll condition and shiny I have been using for years on my curly hair. Really moisturizes and tames hair in the most humid environments. One jar lasted several years. Highly recommend for curly and thick hair. The best Hairdressing I have found. Love this product. I can add it all over my hair and it won’t weight my hair down.",3,4,-1

It's my second bottle.

Suave NATURALS doesn't has as many additives as other conditioners. This conditioner works well and it is very inexpensive. I would highly recommend it. The bottle is easy to use and lasts for a long time. Will dry your hair out and tangle/break off your hair. Waterfall mist is the best and moisturizing for natural 4b hair.

I spray this in my HAIR and it lasts for SO long! I don't wash my hair everyday, so this is nice to spritz and refresh my hair and it makes my hair soft too!! I've read some of the review and it looks like some people are using it as a body spray. This is hair perfume people. Not body mist! I read all the reviews saying it smells like cotton candy.  It doesn't to me. I like the scent. They are on to something, but it could be perfected.  The cap doesn't stay on well.  The scent does last awhile which is great. Absolutely love the smell. Saw it on an influencer and she was right it smells so sweet. Haven’t used as much as I thought but is great when I need it. Definitely camouflages bad smells for instance I went to someone’s house who had cooked hamburgers inside and the ventilation was not good. I stunk and my hair stunk but after putting that in it was gone I’m big on smelling good, you can apply it to your hair and your body. I get compliments ALL the time. I spray my hair before I leave the house (1-2 sprays)  and it’s long lasting You'll smell so sweet, men or women will think you are candy Olor duradero no maltrata elCabello . Me encantó 🤙 Love this product! I first tried it several years ago when my mother-in-law gave it to me. Haven’t been able to find it till recently. Use it very often and love the scent. Definitely a great buy! I will definitely be purchasing this again! Smells great of course but the scent doesn’t last nearly as long as the perfume itself.I’ve had one bottle of the perfume for almost a year/use almost daily and it’s barely halfway gone.This however is almost empty in less than a month.A couple of spritzes of the actual perfume is like 7-8 spritzes of this.Great, but not exactly worth it for me.",5,3,2

I have 95% 3B curls with some 3A looser curls around the nape of my neck and ears. My hair holds a curl very easily and I don't really have to do any major styling to achieve my ringlets. The one very random, major issue I have with my hair is unlike other ringlet curl girls, my hair does not clump together naturally at the top of my hair or have any sort of curl definition if I do not use a brush to style it. However, the length of my hair clumps all by itself. Wash Go's don't exist to me and I HATE the outcome. This is a more recent issue honestly and I am not sure if my curl pattern is changing or if its due to hard water damage. My hair is super healthy and I would say its a medium porosity level. It likes both protein and moisture and I really don't lack in either one. I never need more than a cream and a gel to style my hair and I always defuse it. I have used the 7 row and 10 row Denman in the past and while they did clump my hair, they did nothing for my root issue.I give you all this info so you have a basis of what my issues are and where my hair is at. Hopefully it will help you determine whether this brush is for you. My major goals with this brush: more clumping, less need for finger coiling looser areas,  faster styling and to achieve more definition and clumping from the roots of my hair so it matches the lengths of my hair. This brush did just that!The other 2 Denman brushes I own are good but they didn't have tension I needed. I section off my hair and take about 2"" diagonal sections pulling up and away from my face to create my clumps from root to tip. With this brush I am able to achieve that even clumping and curl pattern I am looking for. The tension on this brush is great and makes styling super easy and fast. I find the density and combination of different bristles grips the sections better. I style my hair soaking wet with my cream in it and re-wet to scrunch the gel in once I'm done brush styling. The result juicy, even, very defined curls.Who I think this brush is for:Soft, thicker hair textures ( Wouldn't recommend for coarser hair)Those who have trouble with clumpingGirls curl training for ringlet curlsGirls who style on VERY wet hairWho it's not for:Girls who are not focused on definitionGirls for Focused on Volume - with more definition comes less volumeCoarser hair types- the brush may not be strong enough or may even rip your hairCurly girls who have naturally well clumped hairWavy hair girls who don't need clumpingMy one biggest call out with this brush is that I think that it will be something I have to repurchase at least 1-2 times a year. My thick hair is already starting to widen the outer bristles of the brush from the tension my hair places on it. For the results I'm getting though I don't really care.I have also tried the ""Spornette Large Cushion Boar and Nylon Bristle"" here on amazon and can say it may work for less dense curly girls as well. It wasn't dense enough to create the tension my hair needed to clump and left a weird part it the back of my hair that looked like the red sea separating every time I used it.  It was super light weight and a really great brush for those who do not style in diagonal sections though.Hope this helps! Many years ago I was given a similar brush and it finally needed replacing. I looked everywhere but couldn’t finda new one but did find an improved one at Amazon. I love the brush as it adds volume to my thin hair and it also added a sheen to the texture. Thank you for a wonderful product! Recommended by so many different sites this brush is worth it. This ""large"" brush is not quite large enough for my liking. In particular, I wish the handle was longer. It  works well for a child's head or maybe someone that doesn't have as much hair as I do. I guess I need an extra large and a handle that is easier to grip. I didn’t remember that I had purchased the small size, and I have a ton of hair so I nearly returned it, but decided to give it a try. It’s Definitely small but mighty. I didn’t have any trouble brushing out my whole head, and it left my hair shiny and soft. like the size, the way it fits into my purse, the strength of the boar bristles for massaging the scalp and the softness that distributes the natural oils of the hair. My hair gets so snarled a family of birds could happily make a home in it. I'd been researching hairbrushes for awhile and was skeptical about this boar brush and tooth hybrid, but it's so great! It handles my snarls and my hair seems healthier too. Terrific",5,3,2

item,Star Lacio Lacio High Shine Leave in Hair Conditioner 7oz. [Health and Beauty],"Great. Leaves my hair with a lot less frizz and a lot softer. I have long, relaxed hair and I have found that this product works best for me when it is used on wet hair (which the directions suggest) before blow drying. After washing, I towel-dry my hair, apply this leave-in and a heat protectant serum (my personal fave is CHI Silk Infusion), and then proceed to blow-dry my hair. My hair is much more straight, soft, bouncy, and shiny than when I don't use Lacio Lacio as my leave-in on freshly-washed hair. The smell is absolutely HEAVENLY and I cannot stop myself from grabbing the bottle and smelling it when I'm near it. It almost makes me wish that the scent came in the form of a body wash or something! I only wish that the smell lasted after the blow-drying and styling process is over, but alas, you can barely smell it once it is all said and done. (Why does it seem that only the smells of stinky products hang around?)Another drawback is that it does absolutely nothing for my hair if applied when it is dry. (I suppose that this is why the directions suggest using it on wet hair). It even makes it feel a bit dry. Though it makes my hair soft, it doesn't feel as if it has added moisture to my hair, regardless of whether it was applied on wet or dry hair. It does have some protein (listed sixth in the list of ingredients), so that my have something to do with it.For those interested, here are Lacio Lacio's ingredients: Water, Methylciclopolyslloxane, Dimethylpolysiloxane, Alcohol Graso C14-C18, Cetrimonium Chloride, (Quaternium 79) Hidrolized Wheat Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Fragrance, DMDM Hidantoine, Methylchlorisothiazolinone/Methylisothiazolinone. Whenever i get done shampooing and conditioning my hair, i dont look forward to detangling which always results in a ball of shed hair. I have relaxed hair with very tangled ends and some splits ends.The deep conditioner i used did not give me much slip so i tried lacio lacio for the 1st time. I followed the instructions which recommend using it on wet hair so after i towel dried my hair i applied applied a medium sized amount throughout my hair in sections. Its important to apply it to your hair in sections to make sure it penetrates thoroughly.The comb actually went through my hair in one smooth motion. I was shocked, like really shocked. To my surprise i combed my hair easily and detangling was a breeze with minimal breakage. No more fustration and clumps of hair on my comb.I left my hair to airdry and i got a soft curl pattern which was nice. I flat ironed short after and my hair is silky smooth and fine. Im writing this review a few days later and my hair is still very soft and easy to comb.Lacio lacio is now a must have in my hair regimen and if you're on the fence try it. Its a miracle in a bottle! This leave-in is, by far, the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used. For reference, I have very thick, tightly curled, mid-back length, multi-ethnic hair. For those interested in curl types: 3b-3c. Lacio Lacio leaves my hair so soft and silky. It is very easy to detangle after I apply this conditioner. It smells heavenly, and my hair will not settle for any other leave-in ever since I bought this one. I recently ran out and had to use a back-up moisturizer, and my hair did not like this. Without the Lacio Lacio, it was more difficult and time-consuming to detangle, and it felt a bit coarse. My Lacio Lacio order from Amazon finally arrived, and my hair would've thanked me if it could talk! You definitely won't regret this purchase. However, if you have sensitive skin or skin problems, this product may irritate your scalp because of the preservatives they use. I have no problems with it, but if you have sensitive skin, you may just want to use a little at first to test it. The only thing I hate is that I can't find it in any beauty supply stores around here, so I always have to order it online. I definitely recommend this to those with thick and/or curly hair! The product received is not the same as the picture I have medium coarse, wavy/curly, frizzy hair made worse by coloring and wiry greys.  This product made my hair much softer, though I have to use two pumps of quarter-size amounts for shoulder length hair.  It doesn't make my hair greasy, though my hair is very dry.  And, it doesn't have the slippery feeling of any silicones, which is what I wanted, as I will use a heat protector and a finishing serum and didn't want to add extra cones.  I purchased this because it seemed to have the most silk of the products I reviewed, and I know silk makes my hair soft.The price is good, it will last a long time, and it did what I was going for--softness.  Maybe it adds some shine, hard to tell with the other things I use as well. I have chemically relaxed bra-strap length hair that is dull and dry. This product helps a lot. I apply a quarter sized amount (I have a lot of hair) and focus on my ends, which need the most care. Then I blow dry with an ionic blow dryer and a round brush. My hair is soft, smooth, bouncy and straight that often times I can shape my hair with only the round brush, no flat iron needed! It also has a pleasant smell and doesn't give hair that burnt smell that a lot of leave-in conditioners do when you blow dry with product in. I just love this stuff because it is affordable, works great on relaxed hair and makes my hair appear shinier and feel smoother. I am so glad I discovered this product and I recommend it to everyone! Give it a try :) I am about 11 weeks out from my last relaxer so needless to say I am pretty thick at the roots. I washed my hair and used a conditioner and washed it out. My hair was very thick and slightly difficult to comb through. I put in this leave in conditioner and even though my hair was thick, it was very soft and I was able to comb through it immediately. I then blow dried my hair with the attachable comb and then flat ironed it. I was absolutely amazed at the shine but esp the fact that my hair now looked like I was only a couple weeks post relaxer. I have gone to several Dominican shops in my area and wondered what in the world they were putting in my hair before they roller set it. After a little research, I have the answer and can save myself time and money doing my own hair!",2,5,-3

and was happy with them. DO NOT USE THESE OR ANY OTHER VELCRO ROLLER IN LONG HAIR!I ordered these a few weeks back but only just had a chance to use them.  After reading tutorials online about how to use velcro rollers (and after years of using hot rollers and curling irons and rag curls), I figured I was pretty prepared to use these.  The first four went in fairly easily, the fifth one went slightly off-kilter just as I was rolling it the last inch to my scalp.  No big deal, it happens with curlers, just unroll it a couple of inches and reroll it up, right?WRONG.  That was more than an hour ago.  I have spent the time since then trying to get this single curler out of my hair.  It has tangled so horrifically that I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get it out AT ALL.  I'm pausing in my careful attempt to remove it to vent some of my frustration here in this review.  It's either that or get out the scissors and cut my waist-length hair into a pixie cut.  That's how bad these curlers are.  I've been growing my hair out for more than six years, and I may lose it all because of one stupid curler, and a manufacturer who didn't see the need to include any sort of instructions or warnings about their product.  If someone walked up to me and chopped my hair off, that would be physical assault and they would be arrested, but this product has essentially done the same thing by not including any warnings or guidelines or instructions.Do not buy these if your hair even touches your shoulders.  If your hair is longer than your shoulders, just close this page right now.  Don't buy them if you're trying to grow your hair out.  Don't buy them if you like your hair.  Don't buy them if you've ever had any kind of curler get twisted or tangled in your hair.  Don't buy them if you have trouble with a french braid, as these require at least twice as much back-of-the-head dexterity as french braids do.Basically, don't buy these.  If you have a bob type hair cut, hair that isn't prone to tangling and isn't especially fine, and you are exceptionally adept at putting curlers into the back of your hair without twisting or tangling, then maybe consider these.  But don't think for a moment you'll be able to use the smaller sizes without it turning into one giant rats nest.  Best case scenario, the three larger sizes can be used by people with shoulder-length or shorter non-tangling non-fine hair.  Everyone else should stay far, far away.My set is going directly into the trash as soon as I can get this one out of my hair.  At this point I'm just hoping I won't have to break out the scissors. I have seen these particular rollers, and never tried them, so I decided to purchase and see what they were all about. They come with minimal instruction, so I watched a tutorial first before I attempted use. I have fine hair, but a great deal of it, and these tend to give more body and volume than anything. I would not use these on very wet hair, or sleep in them. Overall, I like them. When used properly, it gives my hair a different look than I cannot achieve with a flat or curling iron. These rollers are for people like me who cannot blow dry their hair correctly. I set my wet hair with them and then use the blow dryer to dry it and I get a lot of body with my fine hair. The only thing I don't like are those very tiny rollers. They serve no point for me but maybe they do for someone with very short hair. I have shoulder-length. I can't sleep with them on but I can't sleep with any rollers on my head. I have hair that does not hold curl or volume or anything. I got these to try and add a little volume. They do not stay in my hair. I get one in and before the second one is in the first one has slipped out. These would work better if they came with clips of some sort. I also don't like the sizes. I am not sure who uses the tiny ones, they are useless to me. There are not enough of the second largest size which is what I use the most of. These are a cheap product and the velcro is already starting to fray after only a couple uses. I have used ones that are metal in the core and I prefer these, I think the weight helps them to stay in my hair and with the hairdryer it helps them to hold heat and the volume to last longer in my hair. Not the best product would not buy again. These rollers are exactly like the ones my hairdresser uses on my hair.  They roll smoothly and don't rip or tangle my hair when I remove them.I've found through trial and error that it's best not to use them on your hair when it's soaking wet, as your hair will take forever to dry, even with a hairdryer.On the other hand, if your hair is completely dry, it doesn't hold all that well.  In other words, your hair should be damp, but not soaked to get the best results.This box is very generous with rollers and, even though it comes with two boxes, I don't need any more than the one box, even with my long, thick hair.  I could give the other box as a gift, in fact! I bought these rollers to use when I was commuting to work.  I would partially dry my hair, and while it was still damp I used the velcro rollers (they take about 5 minutes to put in) and hopped in the car.  An hour later in the parking lot at work I would take the rollers out (it takes about a minute to remove them)and i would have a lot of body and wave to my hair.  Perfect! I have blonde hair, and they gave me a good amount of root volume- which was perfect. Great product! Easy to use and quick to put in, they just need a good amount of setting time (an hour or more). I wash my hair at night and let it air dry almost all the way. Then I get a little bit of flexible hold curling mouse and run it through my hair. I grab small sections of hair, comb through it, roll it up, and clip it down by my scalp. I do this until all the hair has been rolled, and then I sleep on it. I take the rollers out in the morning, and wah-la.. Big beautiful, bouncing curls, that are super soft and have great body! So easy, and the curls are long lasting!",2,4,-2

I will continue using what I have left. HOPE I find another product. Guess I want that miracle product - Holy Grail.Do notice my hair does like a bit of oil like jojoba run thru it. And can see the difference. However, don't want to pour a bottle on my head of hair LOL.. I've been using this product since getting a very blond balayage.  My hair is fine, and it has always broken off at the ends - making growing the front out very hard.  The balayage was harsh.This is not just a leave-in conditioner, but it's a heat protectant.  I was able to de-straw my hair from the balayage and encourage it to grow by not breaking off from heating it up daily with a hair dryer or curling iron.  I have fine (limp) hair and this does not weigh it down or make it feel gritty at all.  It works well with my other products, too.  I'm grateful my hair dresser recommended it to me.  My hair no longer breaks off (because I wasn't using a heat protectant before, and I blow dry and sometimes curl my  hair daily).I will continue to use this for years to come.  It isn't cheap, but it is worth it.  Shop around for the best price.  I found this for about $25 at Amazon.  Best price I could find at the time. This works GREAT - makes my hair feel so much better. I have noticed that only using a small amount (less than dime size, depending on hair length and thickness) works better, otherwise hair tends to get greasy I have tried a lot of things on my color treated hair, and this really works. After one use my hair is silky smooth and even looks thicker. Definitely recommend. I like Lanza trauma I am a Caucasian woman in my mid 50’s and have been using this product as my leave-in conditioner for many years.  I have long, curly, hair that has been color-treated for over 30 years (yes, it’s mostly white/gray without coloring).  Although my strands are relatively thin, I have a lot of hair and it becomes easily tangled and can be brittle.  You only need a very small amount of this product — I just comb it in through my  wet hair using my fingers and I love how easy it is to get through my tangles without breaking my ends.  I just leave it in my hair and style and blow dry as usual.  As long as I don’t use too much, this product leaves my hair softer and doesn’t weigh it down.  It also has a lovely, fresh apricot-like scent.  Although I feel this product is rather costly, I haven’t yet found anything similar that I like better for my particular hair type.  And since very little product needs to be used for styling, I’ve found that one tube of this product will last longer than expected.

Takes frizz away and leaves beautiful shine.  Not oily looking. I applied this product to towel dried hair.  After air drying for a half hour I dried it.  My hair feels soft and tangle free. It is not poofy like it was without using  the product. I highly recommend this anti frizz product. Will def buy again. I have medium thick curly hair and to keep it in shape I use this product. Everyone, who has curly hair knows how difficult it is to find a right serum/styling cream. I used John Frieda for years. Now it is in different packaging but I think the product is still the same - even better, updated formula. I use the original formula, because my hair has medium thickness. If you have coarse curls you will need extra strength formula. Original is lightweight, it doesn't weight your hair down, gives the curls nice flow and definition, shine and softness. Don't put too much on, follow the directions and you will have perfect hair day every time you use it. I was looking for it in the stores and pharmacies, where I previously purchased it but no one has it any more. I am glad I found it here. It shipped in a bag. The box was smashed open and there’s no cap for the product bottle which is leaning me toward being used. I’m not 100%. I got this for a travel size product, otherwise I’d send it back. So, we’ll see if it’s garbage in a few days. I’ve been buying this hair serum regularly for 9 years. It works well. I use about a dime-sized squirt on each side of my hair when it’s wet, and it really does help control the frizz in humid weather.However, I would not purchase from this seller again. The normal bottle is 1.69 oz. The price typically ranges from $6-$10. Since I paid $13 for this product and the title literally says “1.69 ounce,” I assumed I was getting the normal sized bottle that I’ve been buying for years. Yet the bottle I received was less than half the size— 0.05 oz. It looks like a sample/travel size. I was jipped. I’m not happy, and will not order again, but I’m not going to return it because I needed the serum for my vacation and the product itself is good. Thus is the best product I ever use ! No oil just put your drops in the hair is so nice and smooth highly recommended!! I am elderly with grey hair.  I have used this product for at least 25 years.  My hair is somewhat thin and wavy.  It turns the waves into loosely defined curls, and it tames most of the frizz.  I use it with some Moroccan oil after shampooing my hair.  My hair feels soft, not at all crunchy.  It looks and feels natural, which is exactly what I want.  I used this when I dyed my hair when I was younger.  It created no harm to the hair.  I enjoy this product which is reasonably priced and easy to use. Me gusta que hidrata muy bien mis puntas de cabello re secas. Mientras lo llevo puesto el cabello se ve bien.",5,5,0

Love this stuff and have for years. Helps hair get less tangled and helps be easier to brush through. I promise it’s worth it!! Bottle was very smalk Great product & fast delivery. Product is fine. I’ve used it before. Just needed a small bottle for travel purposes. My problem is that I made the rookie mistake of not checking my shipping costs. I assumed it was Prime and didn’t double check, so the shipping was more than the actual product cost. I love how shiny it makes my hair. I personally didn't see any Miracle in this product at all. I would say that this product was a waste of money. this was a Best Seller so I was excited to use and apply.The product itself is not bad but not good either so that is why I am giving this product 3 stars out of 5. My hair didn't change at all. I was using this product on a regular basis so whenever I shower I would spray some on my hair. Let me tell you something the smell is incredibly good but the outcome is disappointing my hair have not change at all. Luckily this product didn't do any bad consequences on my hair but still not useful at all in my view. My sister used this product and she loved it so that is a different view. I do not really know why this product didn't work on my hair I have sort of soft wavy hair it is not straight and it is not curly either it is slightly ""S"" waved hair that sticks close to the head. Tends to be fine in density. it does have a natural sheen my waves usually lack volume and definition. I think but not sure though that this product should be used with the other stuff from the same line so I can see results such as shampoo , conditioner , and oil. my sister advised me to use the other product which is "" It's a 10 Miracle Leave-In Plus Keratin"" she said the Keratin might help a bit to my hair nature & I am going to try this product soon. Unfortunately once I consumed the bottle I threw it away so I do not have a picture to attach BUT the bottle was small in size and I expected that. Works really well to keep the frizzies away. I just put some in after washing my hair, brush my hair, and it is good to go. It dries smooth, whereas without it, I would have frizzies sticking out. Great detangler too. Liked the hold & ease of styling",2,4,-2

Great product, but it sucks that the pumps don’t work.  I will need to google how to fix.  I should have kept my pumps from the old bottles I had.  Great product, but it’s not fun to unscrew the pump cap and remove the product. First, the smell of this shampoo and conditioner is so refreshing. Second, my hair was falling out and getting thin, but this shampoo and conditioner has thickened my hair and helped it to stop falling out. I am amazed at the difference in my hair, and other people have noticed too. I know it seems the price is a little steep, but it is worth every penny you spend on it. If your hair is thinning and falling out this is the shampoo and conditioner you need to get!

They are just what I needed--small, single braid-sized, scrunchies! I cannot STAND having hair in my face but I'd look like an idiot with bangs, so scrunchies have been my friend since I was a kid in the 1980's. However, they seem to have gone the way of the dinosaur, and I must admit it *would* look sort of silly to have a puff of material on the crown of my head. But elastics and headbands are too fussy for me, so I have been searching for an alternate to the scrunchy for years and *finally* found these ""Mini Twisters"" several years back. They are essentially tiny scrunchies that don't have that scrunchy-bunch, if that makes any sense.I went through the package (took about six years for them all to wear down/stretch out with daily use) and couldn't find them in local stores. So I came to Amazon, and at first, I didn't think these were them because of the word ""slinky""- I assumed that meant they were made from some sort of silky/shiny material. But I ordered them anyway, and was ecstatic when I opened the box and found out they were my old favorites.These are mini version of the scrunchy, just with not as much fabric/bulk. They are made from a matte material that holds hair wonderfully. I have fine, smooth hair (but a ton of it) and these twisters will either hold all of it or just a few strands, depending on what I'm in the mood for. They are also insanely comfortable- even if I kinda crash on the sofa or am at the movies, it doesn't hurt to have them smash against the back of a seat. They hold hair securely without pulling it.I'm so happy that Scunci came up with a modern twist on an old classic. Even if the big fat scrunchies come back in style, I would never switch. Love the product it is something that I get regularly in store.  It is one of the only hair ties that does not get stuck in my fine natural hair when I band my hair overnight. The price is really good online.  I did have an issue where my order was not quite right.  However, I contacted the stores customer service and they handled it, and I am more than satisfied with the store solution. It’s great, but if it was a little more stretchy I could wrap it around my hair another time instead of it being kinda loose. Does the job though These are not too big. I can wear them on my wrist subtly, and they are more comfortable to use than the thin elastics My go to hair tie. I’ve been using for years. Originally I bought at Meijer, and was bummed when I could longer find them there. I was SO EXCITED to find on Amazon and at a GREAT PRICE. I often add to an order just so I don’t run out , so I can give them away to my friends. Aunt Tina highly recommends. These are great for pretty much all hair types - and don't SCREAM scrunchy from the 80's :) They pretty much dissapear in your hair (unless you have very light blonde hair :) I have thin hair and it does a great job of holding - even if you do three turns for a pony it doesn't end up overly tight and pulling and does not fall out. These are soft with no metal and comfy to sleep on!$6-7 or so is a price for the pack and they hold up very well, I even wash them and they dry quickly and don't unravel. Depending on how you use them, they may stretch out a slight bit, but that is normal with all hair bands of this type. They last a long time before I throw them away due to stretching, and if you have thicker hair this probably won't even be an issues.A great all around pack of hair ties for those who like the ease of a scrunchie but don't like the look :) and tend to lose them so need more than one!",2,4,-2

started using henna and I will never go back to ""regular"" dye. I have learned to mix this better and I don't have to use a full cup for a whole-head dye job. I can get away with using about 3/4 of a cup and I make it a little thinner & leave it on longer. I have left this on for as long as overnight & get much better results with a thinner mix. The trick is that the henna only ""works"" as long as it stays damp on the hair so I cover or wrap it with a small damp cloth or bandana, then cover that with plastic caps or plastic wraps to keep the moisture from drying out. For my afro and semi-coarse 4B/4C hair this lasts about 7 to 8 weeks before my gray starts to peek through. With the Burgundy, my grey turns more ashy-Burgundy than the darker parts of my hair. I can use just about 5 tablespoons of the henna to do a touch-up on the edges when the grey peeks.This seems to add strength to my hair. I still get breakage if I don't take time to detangle, but my overall hair health is better than when I was using regular dye. And this is, surprisingly, much less messy than dye. By the way, I mentioned the smell of the henna. It does wash out 7 dissipate but you also need to rinse or throw away any paper or cloth towels to get rid of the smell or it will linger.I tend to do a lot more deep-conditioning when I am using henna. That seems to help the color last.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I was so worried about using henna because I'd heard warnings about the mess & the effect on 4C afro-natural hair. I should never have hesitated. This is just as easy to use as is ""regular dye"" & I prefer it since it's ""natural"". The wet-grass-dirt smell is the only thing I didn't like. It didn't linger after rinsing, thank goodness. By the way, I only used half of this for my amount of hair (see photo). So 2 uses per jar. Not bad on the wallet.I had already used the Dark Brown/Sable shade before getting this color and the results I got were amazing. Because I had already dyed my hair black with a traditional method, you can't see the results in photos. However, my hair is softer and stronger after just one henna treatment. I typically have to deal with ""crunchy"" hair after a wash until I put in a ton of product. The henna left my hair strawlike - which was terrifying - after I rinsed but doing 5-minute deep conditioning solved that. Once it was completely dry, I had no ""crunch"" or texture problems.Rinsing this out was an ordeal. I did the first warm-then-cold rinse for what seemed like 5 minutes and there was still some grit and clumps when I checked. I ended up rinsing about 4 times before everything was out. Then again, I have thick, afro-kinky hair.This did elongate my natural curl pattern but only slightly. Now, when I wash, I have less shrinkage and breakage. It really did strengthen the strands.The one thing I have not discovered yet is how often I will need to do this to keep the gray hair covered. I am guessing I might need to do another treatment once a month or every 7 weeks maybe.As far as worrying about the mess, this was less messy than dye that rips and runs. Once I got this mixed and on my hair, I had zero problems. When some got on the kitchen backsplash and in the shower during the rinsing, it was really easy to wipe up. I used some oil on a paper towel and it came right off the painted & textured backsplash. For my shower, which is a kind of hard rigid plastic, this washed out with the shower spray.For people who use grease or oil on their scalp or hair, you will want to wrap your hair if damp when going to bed. I did get some residue the first time I finger-styled my hair using an oil cream product. That actually made sense when I read that the way to get henna out of your hair quicker is to use mineral oil.The instructions are great (and can also be found on the brand's site) but did not specify how much liquid to powder to use. I contacted Rainbow Research and they said it's about 1 cup liquid to the same amount of powder. They said it should be the texture of mayo, oatmeal, or pea soup. I made my dense enough not to drip and I added olive oil for dry hair issues.I see no need to return to using my old dyeing methods. This is going to be a way for me to transition to embracing my gray hair. This shades it rather than totally covering it up & I like that. If you’ve never used Henna before, make sure you go online and look up the directions. It can be a little bit complicated. It needs to be mixed and sit for 6 hours to come into color, then you use it and depending on the color you want needs to be on your hair overnight. It can be mixed with some other ingredients to get a different effect. And you need a protective coating on your skin around hair line. Make sure you understand the product.I didn’t and put it straight on as a mask and it lightened my hair in a weird way & I had to correct later.  I will try working with it again someday. When I purchased this item I did not expect it to cover my grey hair.  What is more amazing is that I wet my hair every day and the color stayed so well for a very long time.  When I was using permanent colors I had to keep redoing my hairline often, but with this I do not have to.  Hey!  Thank you. ❤️ Henna: Red: my hair is 3 shades of brown naturally(as you can see in my first 2 photos), and it is to my lower back. I used a whole jar, 2 tbsp 365 organic white vinegar, brewed 1 tea bag of celestial seasonings raspberry zinger & 2 tea bags of celestial seasonings wild berry zinger, and used the tea as my water supplement, 1 egg, 20 drops of Radha Beauty Lavender essential oil( I should've used more), the henna mixture scent is strong af!, mixed with a bamboo spoon in a glass bowl, covered with plastic wrap/press n seal for 30.5 hrs. Put mixture on air dried hair, left on for 12hrs overnight with plastic wrap and a beanie. Washed it with Camille Rose sweet ginger cleaning rinse, conditioned it with Camille Rose Moroccan Pear conditioning custard, and left that in my hair for 15min. It's not as red as I wanted, but it's aight. Es bueno te ayuda con la cana aunque  no dura muchos y también  es un poco complicado  sus uso This product is just as easy to use as the regular henna powder that I have been using for years. The lighter, reddish color holds for a about a month, but the darker hue, the chestnut, washes away after the first shampoo. Next time, I will try the dark-brown version. This is the only brand of henna I use. I get it in Strawberry Blonde. Born a natural redhead I've need to ""augment"" my color now in my 50s. This is the best henna I have found on the market. Save myself hundreds of dollars a year switching from salon coloring to henna. It really helps to have someone else apply it to your hair so they can see that the roots are well covered. I'm blessed to have two sisters happy to help me out 3 or 4 times a year. The color lasts beautifully except for roots growing out. Remember: henna is a permanent hair color and you will not be able to switch back to other hair dyes until you grow it out. This product is extremely easy to use. Please follow the instructions!!  It is really important for you to extract the pigment out of the henna by mixing tea, or coffee etc. as stated in the directions. This step is extremely important based on what type of colors you are trying to get from the Henna. If you mix it with just water the color is going to get more orange tone but if you want darker colors you need to mix coffee or black tea with it. If you want lighter colors then you use chamomile tea etc. If you have gray hairs please follow the directions by adding apple cider vinegar to the henna mixture and I would highly recommend leaving it on your hair for several hours like 4+ so that the pigments seeps into the hair follicle more. I would also highly recommend extracting the pigment and making this mixture hours before you are going to use  the henna  on your hair ( make sure to cover it and keep it out of direct light). This will give henna more time to release its pigment so that your hair takes it up easily. My hair took this product up very well and covered the gray hairs,  again you have to leave it in your hair for more than an hour,  I would say at least four hours minimum.  Make sure that you have your hair wrapped or in a shower cap so the henna doesn’t dry out in your hair, which will make it very difficult to wash out. Overall pleased with the product.",3,2,1

semi permanent color. My hair is mostly light to medium brown with some blond highlights that have turned somewhat brassy.  I have a moderate amount of gray in the temples and a minimum amount of gray throughout the rest. Sandalwood 10, is a beautiful shade of dark blond, the reason i like this color over dark blond neutral (9) is that this color # 10 doesn't have any red tones to it, it also doesn't have any ashy tones which is usually the case when a color says cool. Gray hair colors differently than hair with pigment. Anything with warm tones (gold or red) will turn gray hair yellow or orange and cool / ash tones (green) will translate as dull, possible green on gray hair. This color gently covers gray so dont expect full coverage like you would get from a permanent color.  I like natural instincts because i can use this to highlight my gray without covering my natural color. its gentle and it does wash out, although i do wish it stayed in a bit longer than it does. I wash my hair 3 X a week and this color lasts covering the gray nicely for about 2 weeks, by the 3rd week, my temples could use a refresh. The color is easy to apply but dont leave it in longer than 15 minutes or you will risk it lightening your hair at the roots where it's virgin hair. (Now that I've said that, please don't try to use this to lighten your colored hair, because it will only lighten virgin hair.) This does have some peroxide in it, so that it can deposit color. Overall, its a good product and the conditioner works nicely to soften the hair. I have naturally dark blonde/light brown hair with a lot of red undertones. My hair easily turns brassy, and so I have to be cautious when coloring it. Sandalwood is perfect for my hair type. It never gives me any brassiness whatsoever, and the color is very natural looking. I have about 10% gray, and while it doesn't completely cover it, it does make the gray blend in and look like soft highlights for about 1 to 1 1/2 months. After that I will start to see the gray showing up, and I know it's time to color again. My hair always looks shiny and healthy after coloring. It also gives my hair some fullness because it deposits color on the hair, thereby making it appear thicker.As for the new formula, I actually prefer it to the old one because with the old one you had to wet your hair before applying the color. With the new formula, you apply it to dry hair which is more convenient. I have not noticed any difference in color results between the old formula and the new one. The two week refresher is an added bonus and will give your color a boost as it starts to fade.I hope they never stop making this color because I haven't found anything that compares!UPDATE May 8, 2013: I still love this color and haven't found anything better, but they have changed the formula again, and now you have to apply the product to damp hair once more. This extra step makes the product more difficult to use because it's hard to tell if you've missed any areas if your hair is already damp when you apply the solution. Also, the color refresher seems to have changed. It tends to make my hair yellow-looking, and I do not use it anymore. I will still use Natural Instincts, but they could do a better job on the color refresher and make it so that it can be applied to dry hair again. So I was misled.  I take the blame.  But I believed it when it said it washed out after 28 washes believing it was just some nice hair dye.  This is not temporary.  It contains peroxide in the little bottle that comes in the box.  I had forgot that fact and went ahead and applied it to my hair.  I had been trying to grow out my natural hair color for 5 months and did not want to color it anymore.  Now I get to start over again.On the other side of this issue is the fact that I did look better and younger, color was ok, and after it fades out for a  couple of months it looks much lighter.  If you want to use a temporary hair dye, this is not what you want.What does semi-permanent mean anyway?  Is that an oxymoron? I absolutely LOVE Natural Instincts!  I have used it in the past and for some reason, I decided to go see a professional to get a professional balayage/ombre for my brunette hair.  Unfortunately, the hairdresser RUINED my hair and I walked out a bleached blonde.  My hair is naturally a medium dark brown and it is very long (down to my bottom).  I'm not going to talk about the damage that was done to my hair (although Natural Instincts has been a part of the healing process), but one of my biggest problems is that when my hair gets lightened, it turns brassy orange/red very quickly.  I have tried purple shampoo, blue shampoo, and the naissant almost black shampoo, semi-permanent color and NOTHING works!!  The only thing that gets the brassiness out of my hair is Natural Instincts.  I have posted a before and after picture.  I actually use 3 colors to achieve an ombre look (which I had to figure out on my own because the hairdresser just turned my whole head blonde!).  I use light ash brown on the top 1/3 of my hair, dark cool blonde on the middle 1/3 and medium cool blonde on the bottom 1/3 and I love the results.  My hair ends up feeling healthier, looking healthier and the brassiness is gone.  I hope this helps others out there, especially brunettes, as there is not much help out there.",2,3,-1

They are getting harder to purchase and find. I bought multiples when I found them on here. They don't pull or tug on my waist length thick hair. They are sturdy and don't break. I would definitely repurchase these combs and recommend them to others. I love this comb. I have straight fine hair and needed a comb to brush my hair after taking a shower. I had heard of the Mason Pearson brand so I purchased this comb about 7 years ago and have used no other comb or brush since. I have had to replace it once after dropping it on the floor and some of the teeth broke off, but that was after 6 years of use. I have since bought a new one and it feels and looks the same as the original one I had. It has a good weight to it, the teeth are strong and it doesn’t warp or need cleaning. I would purchase other products from this brand and highly recommend it. I have long, and a curly hair (not tight curls unless I scrunch and diffuse but curlier than waves).  It used to be super manageable, but for the last two years it has gotten unrulier, more and more tangled and less silky.  I swim a lot, which means constantly having to get tangles out.  I've tried spray in detangler, leave in conditioner, Bumble and Bumble hairdresser's oil products, Morrocan Oil, the Wet Brush, other dentangling brushes and combs. I like some of those products, but I still dreaded the long periods of time it would take to brush out my hair. I finally caved and bought the Mason Pearson Detangling Comb and MP Detangling Brush. I LOVE both of them. The comb is great on wet or dry hair, and definitely helped detangle - it did exactly what it says it will do.  While I still see a few strands of hair come out into my brush it is hardly ANY - a few strands, compared to the tons of damage and hair with my Wet Brush (which was better than yet more brushes I've tried), AND it's faster to brush AND it's not painful.  I recommend both!! I bought this to accompany my Mason Pearson boar bristle/nylon brush because that should not be used on wet hair. The hairbrush is FANTASTIC, way better than any other brush I have used. This comb is just a good, sturdy comb. Which is nice, but don’t expect it to be the miracle comb equivalent of the Mason Pearson hairbrush. It doesn’t work much different than any other comb, but it is well-built and takes a beating from my very long, very tangle-prone hair. The bristles are well spaced out for wet combing, and it is easy to clean product off of. One star is deducted just because it’s really not THAT much more amazing than a cheap comb, but is way more expensive. Really, you pay for the prestige of association with the world’s freaking best ever hairbrushes. But this is just a good comb. I was using a drug store comb that looked almost identical to this. However it was molded in 2 parts and the seam is in between the tines, and it was not polished smooth. I kept wondering why I'd always have hair in the comb when detangling even with a detangling product after conditioning. Then I noticed those seams... and decided to spring for this expensive comb. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and it's great - no more pulled-out and broken-off hair!The seller ""Shave and Fragrances Co"" I cannot give 5 stars, however - they get 2 stars.First, they took weeks to ship the item, and then they shipped it with ""in person signature required"". Who can sit around at home all day waiting to sign for a package? I have to work! And to go to the depot to pick up a comb defeats the purpose of having bought it on AMazon - to have it conveniently delivered to my door, since I have a very busy schedule. At least allow a signature waiving the liability and have them leave the package - I live in a gated condo building, no one is going to steal my comb! So I won't be buying anything from this seller again. I was hesitant to purchase this comb because of the price. My penchant for luxury and my curiosity ultimately prevailed and I'm glad to say that this comb is worth every penny. First, it's strong and won't bend under duress. It's extremely well made and smooth all over so there's no possibility of snagging. I was a bit surprised to find that the comb is plastic (or at least it appears to be plastic). I'm not sure what I was expecting and I still can't quite figure out how a plastic product can be ""handmade"" but make no mistake, it's a lovely piece and a great addition to my hair regimen. I use it immediately after my shower (to dentangle) but it's also a great finishing comb. In fact, I'm purchasing another one today to carry in my purse. It's the perfect size for home or travel. I don't think you can go wrong no matter what type of hair you have. Enjoy! Simply put: Mason Pearson products are well worth the money.For years and years I'd heard that Mason Pearson products were worth the high cost, but I didn't take the plunge until a few months ago. First, I purchased a boar/acrylic hybrid brush for my daughter, who at ten started brushing her hair regularly for the first time because, with the Mason Pearson, at last it doesn't hurt! I quickly ordered a second brush for myself and then two of these combs for the both of us, for detangling. (For those who may not know, hairbrushes are not meant to detangle hair, just to smooth it and distribute oils from root to tip. Combs are for detangling.)I'll admit the dramatic difference between lesser quality products and Mason Pearson is less apparent with the combs than with the brushes, but my stylist assures me that the Mason Pearson combs are constructed in such a way (without seams I think) that greatly minimizes the damage done to hair while combing. I am a covert and highly recommend! This comb was the best item that my wife enjoyed. She loves this comb so much so that she bought 3 more  to give to her daughters and sister. She can not stop saying how this is the best comb she’s ever had. I am a happy man. Happy wife happy life.",3,5,-2

To be honest, I've also tried the Fantastic Sam's styling spray and thought the only difference was the scent (Fantastic Sam's has stronger scent). This is a great product. It works like a hair spray and a scrunch spray in one. I have a double part on the back of my crown and this is great to use to scrunch my hair up and keep it that way so that it lays nicely over the part. This is a large can of spray and worth the price of the $14 or $15 I payed especially since I didn't pay shipping. I have been using this for years.  Initially it was available from my beautician but she retired and closed the shop.  Found another shop in the area that carried it, but that also closed down.  Decided to try Amazon, and was able to get it.  Does not make my hair stiff and when I comb it out, it does not resemble straw. I've re-ordered this product several times. It doesn't have a scent that is overpowering and will fight w/ your cologne. I use this whenever I have a perm. I normally have fine straight hair, but when I get a wave put in this gives me the right amount of hold to keep the curl formed all day. Prevents them from going limp. My mom being a hair dresser, Ive used this product for as long as I can remember, I love it. I am now out of state and cant easily get it so I ordered it from amazon. At the same time I ordered this hair spray, I ordered scruples mousse from a different company. I got my mousse 4 days ago and am still waiting for my hair spray. This is a great hairspray!  It does not make me gag when I spray it on my hair in my bathroom like some other hairsprays have done.  It is lightly scented and holds my hair all day, no matter what the weather.  You can even use it as a styling spray!  Absolutely my Holy Grail of hair sprays!  :o) It is a better price than I can get at my salon! I have been using this product for years. Great product!",5,4,1

Rose Hip & Argan Oils | 75% Organic Ingredients | 11oz","OK, let me set the scene with the mess that my hair was before I started my new haircare regime. I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect. It was very dry and impossible to de-tangle and was driving me crazy, nothing was working for it.I bought this even though I don't shampoo too often (and the conditioner to match) to use regularly as a part of a moisture-only routine as I wanted to avoid using anything with protein added for my 'regular' washes (as opposed to deep conditioning days). I'd read some recommendations of this product online and I liked that it's fairly natural.When I received the actual product and opened the bottle, it smelled pretty disgusting to me; it's very herbal in an unpleasant way, to the point of smelling almost like chemicals, if that makes any sense. When I used the shampoo I was worried because it didn't feel nice on my hair after rinsing, and the conditioner didn't really feel like it was doing any good either. Nevertheless, I combed the conditioner gently through my hair and rinsed it out at the end of my shower. The smell once it was mixed a little wasn't quite so bad but I still wouldn't describe it as nice, to my tastes at least.I detangled my hair with a wide-toothed comb and it seemed to be easier than usual. But I didn't notice how incredible my hair felt until I dried it off. I felt like blow-drying my hair which I don't often do, and from the very first section I was stunned at how silky and easily manageable my hair had become again. Seriously I cannot praise this stuff enough; I have not used it long term but for it to have done my hair this much good from one simple sitting, I'm pretty amazed - especially considering how skeptical I was. This product is definitely worth a try considering it's not that expensive, and the bottles aren't exactly small so it will last quite a while.For the good that it does to my hair, I can forgive the smell; it actually doesn't smell at all unpleasant once the hair is dry and if you've applied other products it mixes well - you know that smell your hair gets when you've just been to a salon to get your hair washed, cut etc? That's what it smells like to me after, which is nice lol. If it bothers me when I use it regularly I'll just mix in another oil to make it smell better. The main point is, this stuff works for me and I'm really happy about it!I will say that before I used these two products, I had done a deep cleansing and balancing/conditioning treatment in order to fix the foundations of my hair as much as possible, so this also adds to the reasons why my hair is feeling much better than before. However I do feel that this and its conditioner really works well with my hair type and I definitely have this product to thank for how well my hair is doing on only day 2 of my routine. I can recommend it to anyone with moisture problems with their hair.If you don't want to buy both the shampoo and conditioner I'd say go with just the conditioner, but I feel that they both helped each other out and work well together as they should. Have you ever drank sweet aloe juice you might find in some oriental grocery store? Have you ever drank really high quality green tea freshly brewed with leaves NOT in a bag?To me, this shampoo smells very intensely like a mix of really really nice green tea and a hint of aloe juice or something -- and it smells pretty sweet. But what the scent is actually coming from is probably all those floral and herbal extracts, because this shampoo has no green tea in it whatsoever :P (I know, it's not green tea I'm just saying it smells a lot like it to me).This is probably the best-smelling shampoo I've ever used in my life -- granted I love the smell of fruit like mangoes, peaches and pears, there's just something EVEN BETTER about the smell of green tea in a shampoo. Probably because when I think green tea, I think CLEANSING -- whereas mangoes peaches and pears, sure they're very sweet and healthy, but if you were to slather yourself with those sweet fruits (instead of wet green tea bags), you'd probably get all sticky and kind of yucky.As far as being an effective shampoo, this is very good at de-greasing and just in general, cleaning I guess. I haven't tried using it by itself in one showering session, however, I'd imagine if I went without the matching conditioner, my past-shoulder length hair would be a bit harder to manage.I love how this has no sulfates, mineral oils, parabens or other weird synthetic chemicals in it. but that's what probably makes this stuff so expensive compared to conventional shampoos.I wish they'd sell these in larger containers, or at least make them cheaper. I recently attended a health seminar that made me realize that every thing you put on your body ends up inside your body - it enters your bloodstream through your skin and eventually circulates to all your internal organs.  So basically, if you wouldn't eat it, you shouldn't put it on your skin.  So I decided to throw away all my chemical-ridden drugstore beauty products and start buying all organic.  Soap and lotion are easy, but I was unsure how the shampoo would go.  As mucb as I want to be natural, my hair is very long and needs to look good.  I am happy to report that this shampoo did not dissapoint.  It leaves my hair as shiny, bouncy and healthy looking as my Pantene used to.  My only negative feedback is that the smell is very strong - it's floral but kind of in an unappealing way.  I don't really care for it.  It's almost like roses mixed with sulfur or something. But luckily, you only smell it while shampooing and once your hair dries the smell is pretty much gone.  I am going to experiment with some other shampoos in the Aubrey line to see if any have a better fragrance.  The Chamomile volumizing shampoo (not the blue chamomile) is next on my list.  Chamomile sounds much more mild smelling than rose, so we'll see how that goes.  In the meantime I am still using the Rose - the smell is not enough of a deterrent to make me stop using it.",5,3,2

So it's difficult to make a comparison with other natural organic products.  My only frame of reference is to other products out there.  This shampoo cleaned my  hair sufficiently and didn't seem to leave behind any feeling of residue or heaviness on my hair.  It lathers nicely.  I really didn't notice any minty aroma or feel to it.  It does seem to strip the hair clean of build up...which in turn tends to tangle my hair.  The companion conditioner was used, as recommended, and it didn't really smooth out or detangle quite to the degree I'd like.  I have been using a product sold on TV by that famous hairdresser in Los Angeles that is all the rage because it's soap free.  His product leaves my hair totally silky, totally tangle free and is also supposed to remove all harmful residues.  However, it hasn't helped my seborrheic dermatitis and that was my goal with this shampoo/conditioner along with other products to treat it.  What I may wind up doing is continuing down the path with the organic shampoo and using the tried and true tv product as my conditioner because I know it gets the job done. I bought this because I wanted a chemical free shampoo.I have very oily skin and scalp (and lots of thick straight hair) the first week I used it (on a daily basis) I noticed that my scalp would look oily after about 8-9 hours, I almost went and bought another shampoo except I was too busy to make it to the store so I kept using it.  The 2nd week of use I noticed my hair was no longer getting as oily as quickly, by the 3rd week my scalp had gotten used to it and my hair no longer gets oily quickly, I've been using it for at least 4 months now and I'm very happy with it.If you smell it in the bottle it does smell minty but my hair does not smell minty after rinsing and drying my hair (I personally don't mind this) although I also started dying my hair at around the same time so maybe that's why my hair doesn't retain a minty smell?? I believe this is really good shampoo.  It falls into the ""clear and clean"" category, allowing you to start fresh and use whatever conditioning you prefer after the shampoo. The interesting thing about it is; it is not clear, and it does seem to have conditioning properties without feeling greasy.  It doesn't have an overwhelming smell, mainly smells mint-like,  and helps keep my scalp feeling clean.  It seems to be very gentle and is concentrated enough that I can use a pretty small amount, but it doesn't feel like you have stripped your hair of oils if you use too much.  It is a bit expensive compared with others; for the price I wish they could include a pump top to help curb waste. Bought this for my bf who suffers from dandruff.He says it works well for preventing dandruff but this has to be used fairly consistently, as in at least every other day to everyday to prevent dandruff otherwise it will come back. This was a concern for my bf, who normally uses conditioner everyday to wash his hair because shampoo leaves his ends dry. However, using this particular anti-dandruff shampoo everyday does not make his hair as dry as other shampoos with harsh ingredients.Results will obviously vary from person to person, but overall this is a great product for people who are looking for a natural anti-dandruff shampoo product. I am always on the look out for a decent shampoo that won't strip or dry out my hair. I remember once that my hair dresser recommended a shampoo with purified water as the first ingredient. Trying to find that is next to impossible without paying salon prices. This shampoo meets that criteria, doesn't contain harsh chemicals, and smells lightly of mint (not overwhelming). It lathers with effort, but that's because of it's lack of that particular agent. Thus far, I like this shampoo and will continue to use it Tingly, minty,  clean feeling afterwards, rinses easily.Hair is tangly afterward so needs its companion moisturizer rinse, then it's manageable but a bit flyaway.Minus one star because a lot of shampoo is needed to get the hair and scalp thoroughly covered.Since so much more product is needed, this jacks the price per use up, not economical.I also use it as a body wash; does a fine job in that regard as well.I like it, but still wishing for a product I LOVE. I have been dealing with sebborrheaic dermatitis on my scalp for several years. Even went to a dermatologist who prescribed a three shampoo regimen, which seemed to help. Having a history of skin sensitivity to certain soaps, It came to me that maybe the shampoos I was using to fix the problem were actually causing it. So, here I am, only a week into using ths shampoo, and my scalp is clearing up! So, I am very happy at this early stage with my new BSF (best shampoo forever). Oh, I would use this shampoo even with a clear scalp. It smells good (mild) and leaves my coat shiny. I love this shampoo!  It does wonders for my scalp and has a very pleasant smell.  Great for color treated naturally coarse hair.  It's not very moisturizing but a moisturizing conditioner can create a good balance.  I will be purchasing more of this product!",1,4,-3

It's easy to work through your hair and detangle. I love it! I’ve used the Giovanni Tea Tree shampoo in the past and really liked it. I decided to try this product since I’m growing my hair longer. My hair is thick and needs even more moisture in the winter months. I use the Reuzel Grooming Tonic, which is excellent. The Giovanni conditioner is a great addition to add even more moisture and control of my naturally unruly hair. I’m a fan of this conditioner and will be a repeat customer. This is a great product that I’ve been using for years. A little goes a long way so it’s a decent value for the price. This works well for my fine hair doesn’t weigh it down. Just have to be careful not to use too much makes it soft and easy to comb out. Helps with flyaways. Helps with my waves. I’m a cosmetologist so I’m very picky. Like this product this product makes my hair more manageable Its nice. Hair feels soft and less breakage. Less build up Tried this base on other reviews and I am pleasantly surprised! This leave-in does its job! I'm wearing a short, texturized cut and this is the perfect weight for that...I get moisturized hair but not heavy, weighed down hair. I did have a learning curve...I find that putting this in soaking wet hair is a no-no, it foamed up a lot and it became necessary to rinse a good bit out. Second time around, I applied it to damp hair after washing in the shower and yes, that's the ticket! I live in the south, and this is just right for summer or anytime you want a lighter leave-in...this with a little cream styler and I'm done...after that, during the week I can add a little of this or just a moisturizer as needed. Will definitely purchase again. oh, and no need to be heavy handed, a little goes a long way. This is the best leave in for super dry frizzy hair that I’ve ever used at this price point.",3,5,-2

Conditioner, Biotin B-Complex, 14 Oz","First off, I guess I don't know my sizes very well, because when the shampoo and conditioner came I was shocked (and ecstatic!) at their large size. I used them for the first time today and the conditioner is totally amazing. My hair is softer than it's ever been, so soft that I keep touching it because I can't believe it. And I love that neither the shampoo or conditioner have a scent to them. When I run out, and that will probably be a long time from now because the bottles are so big, I will definitely reorder. I was on the hunt for cruelty-free hair products and this came up. I'm so glad it did! 6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner. really wanted to love this but after using for two weeks, hair is falling out more than before and scalp is extremely itchy. there's olive oil in this, which is extremely bad for Sub Derm. JUST WHAT I NEEDED . I USED HERBAL ESSENCE . IT MAKES MY SCALP TINGLE . I WILL TRY SOME OF THE OTHER SHAMPOOS THEY HAVE I JUST LOVE THE EARTH SMELLS . Its kind of a thin product and makes my hair greasier for some reason. I love Avalon Organics, but this product is ehh. I probably won't buy it again. It's okay, but I don't LOVE it. No harmful chemicals at all (to you or to the environment).  Check out the site Environmental Working Group for more information I used to use It’s A 10 because it really left my hair nicely conditioned but as a guy, I wasn’t a fan of the scent and it’s also pretty pricey. Plus the laundry list of chemicals left me wanting something natural. The smell is a bright and pleasant lemony smell and unlike other conditioners that dry out my hair if I use them more than twice a week, I’ve managed to still getting hair nicely conditioned even if using multiple times a week (like 3 times). I know it’s not good to shampoo and condition to often so I try to limit it to twice a week but sometimes I have an event or work function and need to shampoo and/or condition over that two week limit. This product helps me do that without drying out my hair (sometimes I’ll just condition to avoid overly drying out my hair with too frequent shampoo use). I didn’t expect much to be honest but it turned out to be a good purchase for me anyways. I can’t say my experience will be yours given some reviews. If you can manage to snag a sample from the website, you might be able to try it out before committing to buying this 32 oz bottle. I have been looking for some new shampoo and conditioner with more organic ingredients. I really wanted to love this but I felt like something was missing. It’s not as thick as normal conditioner and did an ok job.",1,4,-3

I have long thick fine hair, and a double crown. I can brush my hair when it's wet with this brush and it doesn't snarl or pull. I bought it because I bought my daughter a similar one and she said it left her long hair shiny and smooth. Would recommend to anyone, especially if you have long hair. I live in the country. So I dye my hair myself, and I do that often since I'm 54 years old and have plenty of white hair. Let's say I'm skilled on doing that. I've been looking for a tail comb that would precisely part my hair into sections. Usually the tail bends and you can't do a good job, so you do it twice, trice... This comb has a sturdy tail with a precise end that doesn't bend. And that's what I wanted. The teeth aren't smooth as they said, but it's ok. I guess it reduces static too. I highly recomend plus the burgundy color is very pretty. This is the only brush I'll use. I have bought several. I keep one in the car at all times, I have one in the bathroom, and I keep one in my purse. My daughter has her own as well. This brush won't pull your hair and it minimizes hair static. I would definitely recommend! This brush is gentle on the hair. I purchased another because I like it so much. My husband has started using it as well. I had begun to find the all plastic brushes too harsh. Being a combo of plastic and boars hair this brush goes through the hair much more smoothly and softly. Handle needs padding My daughter loves this brush; she has relatively long thick hair.  We bought a second one for the upstairs bathroom. Nice color too and has help up with daily use/ These are the best brushes. Do not pull hair at all. Only ones we will use from now on. I love this brush. I stopped being able to find one locally and I was thrilled to find one on line. It is good for both short and long hair and straight or curly hair. The bristles are just the right length and are great for getting tangles out of little girls hair.",1,5,-4

Reconstructor (16 OZ),"Since I’ve started using this conditioner, I can see a difference in my hair. I like this conditioner because it is affective in repairing my hair, and it is a fraction of the cost of the conditioner I thought I’d never stop using. I can visibly see a positive change in my hair, using this conditioner. I need to do a protein treatment once a month on my 3C/4A hair and this works really well My hair has been damaged for years from coloring and heat damage. No matter how much moisture I put in my hair I couldn’t get the healthy look and feel I wanted. I’ve tried expensive products like Olaplex which worked well, but was too expensive. The first time I tried this one there was a dramatic improvement! I usually use it in the shower so it’s in for about 8-10 minutes. Not much time for a leave in treatment but I have tried it and it’s amazing. I’ve been using this 4-5 times a week and my hair finally has the shine and strength I’ve been wanting for so long. This stuff is the shiz! I love this stuff. The pink bottle doesn't work on my dried out bleached broken hair but this one works well! Makes my hair soft, not magically soft but soft. I use it in lieu of conditioner twice a week, as you have to rinse it out. Has fixed quite a bit of bleach damage on my hair, quality product. This is a very good conditioner for High Porosity , Fine (not thick ), course,  type 4b  African American Hair .  I combine this with a hair mask and let it sit for 20 minutes. Then wash it out .. Then put a little bit of it in with a little bit of another protein conditioner and a silk protein conditioner ., combining all 3 to act as a leave in conditioner.. then adding a little hair oil with it .. to making sure I get my ends too .. because the ends are prone to breaking off and this prevents that . I feel like this didn't do all the things it promised. Its definitely moisturising but after using it for about 6 months I can't say that I see a real difference. breakage and shedding have remained the same if not more than before. its okay as a regular conditioner but I don't think its a healing one. Me encanta este producto.",5,5,0

Adds Separation to Shape Smooth Texture for Ease of Use Washes Out Easily No Parabens Color Safe, Multi, Styling Glue, 2 Ounce","I like that it is a clean hair product which is hard to find but it gives a very soft hold, not what I was expecting. I asked some of my Veg ladies a while back if they had any good pomades they've found... which doesn't seem as frequent of a question among most ladies... but one of them sent me a pic of this one, and said she bought it once and never went back, along with a close-up of the label <33When it arrived, i was even more jazzed up to use it... you open the lid, and it has the coolest iridescent glimmer to it!!! Never expected it, and honestly, it doesn't add any cheap middle school sparkle to your look (that I can tell) but its little highlights like this, combined with the major *musts* of Cruelty, Animal-Testing, and Ingredient-free specs, straight up and easy to prove on the label.Even better-- I have been able to use this for all the wild and crazy styles I come up with... from spikes to curls, to surfer hair, to smoother out that annoying cowlicked piece after a long night and a late morning running out the door, lol. And just like it says, its easy enough to wash right out, or sleep in and sport a softer bedhead look the next day :-PMy only regret is that it's hardly available (if at all) anywhere in my area... but for now, this will have to do i suppose...(its SO worth it!!)..so, of course, I'm back to order my 3rd jar! and am now just gonna sign up for subscribe'n'save. I have used Giovanni in the past and always liked the soft floral fragrance of their products. This has a smell like perfume and I personally don't like it since I don't like strong scents. I have used another one of their pomades which doesn't have any scent and I will go back to that one. I Love this wax!  It's slightly glittery and smells like rain after a thunderstorm.  I have fine hair and this feels weightless with the right application. Love it!  This is the best goop for giving some extra texture and body to poker straight short hair.  I can spike it up or lay it flat or smooth it any which way.  There is no smell, it is not tacky or sticky and a little bit goes a very long way. I put this in my hair before silk pressing and it gave my hair a nice shine with some hold. I used it on the sides and edges a bit as well. Not as strong as a typical edge gel but it is a worthwhile compromise. Will buy more as soon as I need to. My hair is natural, but bleached and dyed. No relaxer. This is an alright product. It doesn't have much of a scent & the scent I do detect isn't that great. The product is VERY sticky & a little goes a long way, which is great actually. I don't mind using it on the tips of my hair for added texture but I have to be conscience of using VERY little or my hair will just be ruined & would need to be rewashed. I recently got a shag haircut & wanted/needed some texture so I thought this would help. Honestly, I can only use it on my ends, not my entire hair so I won't be purchasing again.",4,4,0

My hair is very wavy so if I don’t blow dry it, it’s going in a bun. I have tried several products for adults that promise to detangle, but they don’t help and only leave a sticky feeling, especially when blow drying. This stuff didn’t do that. After the first use, the brush went through with barely any trouble and when blow drying, my hair felt silky smooth and light. I finally found my product! Great for tangles on my granddaughter's tangles. I bought enough for all 3 of them plus keeping one at my house. Bought this for my little sister who has bad bed head. Used it after the bath and detangled easy without crying and screaming. smells amazing I was skeptical buying this, works great on our twin 3 year old girls hair. J&J Detangler is the best. I can't comb my wet hair without it. The product arrived damaged (leaking) that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I AM ASIAN. I HAVE LONG THICK HAIR. I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THIS bc I got a HUGE tangle in my hair that I did NOT want to cut out (although yes, I will admit I have, in desperate times, tried to cut some of them out if they were on the underside of my hair 😳🤭🤫). Yes, I am admittedly an adult, and I yet HATE brushing my hair bc it is long and thick and gets the worst tangles sometimes. But I HATE BRUSHING MY HAIR MOST OF ALL BC OF ALL THE HAIR I LOSE WHEN I BRUSH IT. I mean I pull so much hair off my brush after each brushing, even with the best brushes I could find, it would worries me. I really don’t want to grow up to be a bald old lady. Plus I really really really really hate loose hair—if it is not attached to my head, I really don’t want to see it. Not on my clothes or the floor or the rug or the bed or the sheets or the counters or—you get the picture.But anyway, this product smells DIVINE, and that alone made me want to use it again, even though I didn’t have any knots in my hair. And I immediately noticed: I LOST ALMOST NO HAIR USING THIS PRODUCT when I brushed it! Yes it is made for the little snot nosed brats—I mean darlings, but sometimes we adults can benefit from their stuff too. And this was a very unexpected perk! Imagine brushing with a heavenly scented product that didn’t leave goopy crap in your hair and actually made it so you lost almost no hair brushing! I still hate brushing my hair, but I will say this: I have lost a LOT LESS HAIR brushing than I have ever lost in my entire life of hair brushing. And that is a HUGE DEAL for me. THANK YOU JOHNSON PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER READ THIS LOL It works to detangle! Nice larger/wider spray top too, so it’s a bit easier to use than a tiny bottle.  It does help to detangle your hair, especially if you let it set in your hair for awhile. I have used better detanglers than this, but still it is a very decent product at a decent price. I have very long, straight Caucasian hair, and I use it on my own hair. I wish it was cruelty free… Scent is not great, but not offensive either… I would repurchase it, mostly due to its lower price. This detangler has always been wonderful.",3,2,1

Very easy to sleep in and they give you beautiful curls To stiff, go back to the original material. I love these!! So hard to find Create great flawless curls and volume on hair that  that previously fought to stay flat and straight Love these best rollers ever do easy to use I have hair almost to my elbows, so to my dismay, I had to stop using the ""easiest way in the world to curl your hair method"", because my hair is about two inches two long now :(.....  (I'll explain it in a sec.)  So, I started doing pin curls, rag curls, and every type of overnight ""setting"" curl I could do, because my hair simply does not hold curl from heat.  After buying pretty much every type on the market, including the cheap version of these,  I've finally settled with this product.Pros: No heat, fairly comfortable, cute leopard print (so my husband doesn't totally run for the hills, yes, I can be cute with these... sort of), Snap clasp makes these worth purchase, you don't have to use any clips or pins.  These seem really durable and sturdy, and can be washed in the machine.  I don't like little frizzy ringlets, so I put more hair on each stick, and get big full curls, like you would from a set of jumbo rollers.Cons: You will get better at putting them in with a little time.  The first time I used them, I didn't follow directions and interlock each stick, so I used some pin curl clips to hold them in place, which isn't really necessary if you follow directions.  One of the snaps was right on the pressure point of the back of my head, and was a little uncomfortable through the night (my bad).  You really need to dampin the hair AND use some form of product if you have thicker hair atleast.... The curls are really nice, but they fall if you don't use a product and have heavy hair. OKay.... now to explain the ""easiest way in the world to curl your hair"":You simply take an elastic cloth headband and put it over your head (like a native american, or flapper), with slightly damp hair of course, and some product too, and you simply take the hair and wrap up over and down under the band, adding more hair to that piece as you wrap around to the back.  VERY hard to explain without pictures... for the full picture step by step and video, web search ""easiest way in the world to curl your hair, by broken poet"" and your life will be changed.  It works on all hair types, from cheek length to past the shoulders.  When it gets about elbow length, it's too long.  It literally takes 5 minutes once you get the hang of it, for the most beautiful even curls, I've ever had.  Wish I had known about it all my life. If you use this method, all you need is one cloth headband.  You can get them in packs of 3 from any CVS or Grocery store for a couple of bucks.  I would definitely go that route if my hair wasn't so long.  Good luck! I bought some of these about 10 years ago at Walgreens…Same brand and everything. They were made so well with a nice material and flexible foam. Somehow they went missing a few years ago so I found these on Amazon. They are cheaply made with thin material and stiff  foam  and some of the snaps don’t work. They are definitely different than the originals. They work okay once you get them to snap just the quality is not there. I own two sets of these rollers.  I bought a second set so I'd have more of the longer rollers.  If you have long hair, you'll probably need two sets.  Two sets is not cheap as rollers go, but these are not ordinary rollers.What they are is polyester foam (like quilt batting) cut into strips, covered in fabric, with plastic snaps on the ends.  You wrap your hair around, then snap the ends together.  This transforms the roller to a loop.  You link the loops together in a",1,5,-4

It's a good product.  Just user error!! I read other reviews on this before buying it.I gotta say, it’s a very ho hum product.I have thick thick somewhat dry hair that I try to style & keep it looking nice.  Hairspray is key,this doesn’t hold my hair in place at all & I spray product in sections.  Lift a section up, spray it’s underneath let it dry for a few seconds or not.For me, Redken Triple Pure 32 works better.I’m glad I bought a small can of the Sexy hair big. I use this to help set my extensions. Works great. I bought my last bottle of this Big Sexy Hair What A Tease spray here about six months ago and still have plenty left. It lasts a long time and is a good value here verses in stores or salons locally...A hair dresser recommended this product to me years ago and I'll probably never stop using it as long as the formula doesn't change. For reference, I'm from Afghanistan, I have thick hair and loads of it. When I wear it curly, layers pop up too high for my liking and without layers, my hair looks too flat on top.Enter What A Tease... I take my hair about half way higher than half way up and spritz about five sprays at the roots (from a few inches away) all the way around my head. Wait about one to two minutes and then run my hands through my hair.If you brush it through too soon or too late, it doesn't work. You want it to be almost dry before you tease it or run your fingers through it. This gives me more volume than dry shampoo or anything else I've tried.I do this after blow drying my roots forwards and it gives a really natural and sexy boost. Hair up or down, I don't actually tease it, it's almost too easy, and it provides really nice volume.Lastly, you never want to shake this product. After each use, I wipe off the nozzle before it dries (or before you use it the next time, you can wipe it with a wet paper towel or something). Otherwise, it does easily clog. I'd say the good definitely outweighs the bad when used correctly though!I can use it wet or dry, curly or straight. It works best, I think, when your hair is dry and if you're straightening it, then you want to use this last. Highly recommended. Smile. Hope this is helpful! I've been using this specific product for years. My hair is super thin and flat. Sometimes I spray my fingers and puff up my hair or sometimes I style it and spray it, this locks my hair into place.  Humidity or wind... I've tried many, many hair sprays and this is the only one that I've come back too. I love ❤️  love this product!!!!! I have fine hair and can use most products. This stuff is like putting glue in my hair. I have used it only once because I’m afraid of creating a mess Love this stuff. This stuff makes all the difference when getting volume in hairstyles",5,2,3

The fragrance is so overwhelming it made my eyes water and I had to wash it off after about 10 minutes. Even then I could still smell it.  I can’t believe they can’t create this as a fragrance-free product. If they did I’d be a repeat buyer but as it is?  One try and it’s going into the trash. Also, please note:  Amazon’s does not allow returns for this product - which I found out too late. i went overload with this the first time i used it but i would honestly buy another can once i’m done with this one. it’s so beautiful and shiny, perfect to wear in your hair. the only problem i had was the nozzle but i wasn’t pushing down hard enough. be careful though because after pushing it, it might still come out so make sure the nozzle is fully done. Love the glitter love everything about it except for the smell it just kind of reminds me of an old lady smell lol other than that it’s wonderful When you aim the nozzle at your hair little drops go on your face, clothes, furniture etc. Unable to use. I used this for my prom dress and it was so adorable. It doesn't really stick to silk but it is still so adorable on everything. It smells kinda like lysol but I love the smell of lysol so it works for me😅🤪. It ran out really fast though but overall it's very amazing. I really like this product, my hair is a dark brown and I use it to cover a thinning spot on top of my scalp. The only dislike- the hair spray gets on my hands when I touch my hair because my hair is natural as curl cream keeps it moisturized.  Really not much of a scent if any.  Great coverage.  Worth the money comparing to price of other brands. The color was perfect for adding gray to my hair.  Thankfully I was planning to wear a hat because one bottle only covered half my hair in a bun.  Would definitely buy 2-3 for full coverage.",3,1,2

Good size for wigs I love these as they hold hair very secure and are comfortable to wear They are the perfect length for thick hair these are great! they stay in pretty well for smooth pins (the ones with rougher texture will stay in better but these slide right in easier). the sheen wears off fast but they're in your hair, so who cares? the thing to be really careful about is the little protective balls on the end of the pins fall off after a few uses leaving very sharp ends!! i don't think they can be fixed so that makes them disposable sadly. so buying a pound of them is a good idea lol and always check that the protective ends are still there before you accidentally poke yourself.

But is did several wonderful things for my scalp.  It is rather drying, so I only shampoo with it intermittently. A bit pricey for a shampoo, but I bought it on sale so it was affordable for me to try.Ever since I was a baby, I was allergic to some of the microorganisms that are a part of every person’s skin biome.  This allergy resulted in dandruff, starting at age 13. For decades, I tried so many shampoos, both prescription and OTC. Many of them kept the dandruff in control for about 2 days. But this shampoo was different. It eliminated my dandruff. It is a strong shampoo and my theory is that it was able to get under the layer of skin containing dead cells, thus allowing the cells to be rinsed away. My dandruff is gone, and does not recur, but my scalp still gets irritated due the allergy. But it is so nice not to deal any more with the dandruff component of the problem.The next wonderful thing is that I used it on my underarms. I have not detected any odor since using this, but I still use a light amount of deodorant just to make sure. But on the few days that I forgot to use deodorant, there was no odor.If you try is, one of the things my dermatologist said is that each person’s skin is different, and what may work well for one person’s skin will not work for another. So no guarantees here, but I feel pleased that it helped me. This product works great for my family! My hair was falling out so bad that I was nervous about it. Then my hairdresser suggested this product to get rid of the chemicals from the hair products I was using. Why? The hair products of other shampoos, hair spray and mouse, were building up on my hair and scalp so much so that new hair wasn't able to grow. Hair was falling out do to the build-up. Wasn't healthy for my hair or scalp. So this product gets rid of all the build-up of the hair products. Takes some time to do but now a few weeks later I see lots of new hair coming in and the loss of hair has slowed down tremendously. The thing is now my hair feels almost too clean. So now I will use this shampoo like everyother wash. Smells good too. This expensive shampoo has been highly recommended for men and women with thinning hair.  It was recommended to me at age 35 when my hair was thinning and now at age 70 I have a thick head of hair (Rogaine may have helped also).  My female friend was also advised to use this product when she was going through chemo.It is expensive, compared to traditional shampoos.  I paid $30 for a 33.8 oz bottle recently.  But it's worth it if it helps to regrow thinning hair.However I now suspect the product I just purchased will not be effective to regrow thinning hair.  At first I noticed the new product, unlike the old, made NO MENTION of its ability to remove Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the testosterone-based cause of baldness.Next I noticed that the new product said simply: apply, rinse then add other Noxin products.  The old product advised that the medicinal shampoo should remain on the scalp for at least ONE MINUTE before rinsing.  This got me thinking that the new formulation lacked the DHT removing ingredients that would require remaining on the scalp for at least one minute.Next I noticed that the ingredients were DIFFERENT,  despite no notification from the manufacturer that this would occur.And then I observed that the new product was distributed by Wella Haircare in CA and was made in Mexico;  the former product was made by Nioxin Laboratories in Atlanta in the USA.A bit of research revealed the basis for all these anomalies:  Nioxin Research Labs were purchased in 2008 by Proctor and Gamble.  Two years later,  P&G closed the research lab, headquarters and factory in Atlanta and moved manufacturing to Mexico.Nioxin's /P&G's website says that it's effective for thinning hair.  This is the niche that it bought when it purchased Nioxin.  It justifies charging $30  for Nioxin when P&G's Head and Shoulders sells for $3.50.With all these changes by P&G, I question whether Nioxin today is the effective product of yesterday or a new commercial fraud. My husband has used this for4 years and he still has hair and it’s on his head not in the bath tub. Great product and service",1,3,-2

I found a tube of it recently at a grocery store and tried it. I do not want any other conditioner that is how much I love this stuff. I have thin fine hair and I dyed my hair for at least 42 years. I stopped dyeing my hair in August once I turned 60, I had wanted to stop much earlier ....but vanity. Conditioners usually either weigh my hair down, or the effects just are not enough and they do not last. I do not know what they (Neutrogena) did to make this stuff, but I am so hooked, and I say this from the first use. It makes my hair ""better"" like hair is supposed to be. The best way I can describe it is it makes my hair like normal hair again, and the effect lasts for a few days. No other conditioner I have ever used has done this for me. That being said I gave my daughter all my Pantene and she loves that stuff....she can have it. I only want my Neutrogena Triple Moisture ! I am good temporarily I have 3 tubes, but I will order more regularly because it is the best in my hairs opinion. Makes my hair feel  soft I have been using this product and companion shampoo for over 20 years. I need hypoallergenic and no fragrance products. when I started using these products,  there were no such thing as hypoallergenic products. I had to use the sniff test.I would give the products 5 stars, provider on Amazon 0 stars!! I know what the prices are  and this provider must have bought up a sell out product and blown up the prices! Don't buy the shampoo for over $30 each!I just went hunting on Amazon for hypoallergenic fragrance free shampoo. When I run out of conditioner, I will find another Product ! Stay away from this third party provider ! I liked it, but it is way too expensive now. I have long hair that tends to frizz after washing, so, in the shower I wash my hair and apply Neutrogena, then put my hair on top of my head while I wash the rest of me.  After I finish washing, I rinse out the Neutrogena.  This reduces my hair's tendency to frizz and leaves my hair looking good until the next shampoo. I waited to write a review until I had time to really use this product.  It not only moisturizes my fine hair butmakes it much easier to comb through without tangles and pulling our hair.  It does not leave a greasy film and makes my hair shine.  Excellent product. I have medium length hair which is coarse, thick and frizzy. Neutrogena Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner keeps my hair soft and manageable. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week and the results are the same ever since I started using it 3 months back. I usually use this conditioner with the Cream Lather Shampoo from Neurotrogena. This combo works wonders on my hair.The best part is that there is almost no hair loss during hair wash. I have struggled with minor hair loss for a long time and no other shampoo or conditioner, even high end ones, were able to deliver this result. The conditioner is thick and has a creamy texture, so a small amount goes a long way. I generally leave it on for 2-3 minutes before thoroughly washing my hair. I am so glad I gave it a try and would definitely repurchase it. It was too heavy for my hair. I have light hair n right now it’s falling n breaking off",1,2,-1

Luminous Hair Glaze, Color Enhancing Glaze, Designed to Fill Damaged Areas for Smooth, Glossy Brown Color, 6.5 Ounce (Packaging May Vary)","I have recently developed an allergy to hair dye .  Even though I only ever used demi-permanent color, I am now reactive to anything I put on my hair that has peroxide.  Guess what?  EVERYTHING HAS PEROXIDE.  When I try to use it, if feels like I am putting acid on my scalp and every place it touches turns red and inflamed.  Not cute.I am already allergic to henna, so that is definitely not an option, plus I never cared for the orange henna look.  I have been feeling paranoid that I'll be a gray-haired old lady way before my time if I don't find a solution.For years Loving Care was a great choice for deposit-only color with no peroxide or ammonia.  They stopped making it, and now the only deposit-only truly semi-permanent colors are Manic Panic and those like it in radical colors.  Those are great, but a lot of us just wish we could have natural color that lasts for 12 washes and doesn't contain ammonia or peroxide or anything else to lift the color of the hair.  I don't really want blue and purple hair.  There is a no peroxide/no ammonia brand out of Canada that gets mixed reviews, and also a few Indian brands but I'm hesitant because they seem so off-brand.  Using spray-on gray coverage is just SAD.  So I've been freaking out. I have only been coloring my hair for a few years to combat stray grays, and in that time my hair has become brittle and dry.  I always prized myself on luxurious long hair, so I really wanted to find a way to blend the grays and let my hair grow out undamaged.I really wasn't expecting much from this, but I thought if it's truly a color-depositing glaze, maybe it will blend my grays.  I have about 20% that blended well with my natural dark blonde/light brown hair when I colored my hair with light golden brown or medium brown.I didn't use the John Frieda glaze exactly as directed.  I got out of the shower after shampooing and toweling dry,  and applied it like I would regular hair color, using gloves.  It definitely stains skin so make sure to wipe off your face and neck if it drips!  I completely saturated my long hair -- I'd say I used about half the bottle.  Then, I let it sit for 5-6 minutes before rinsing very well.  I felt like I couldn't even get all the product out of my hair with a lot of rinsing, so I actually shampooed it again with a color-safe shampoo.  It still felt silky and glossy after the shampoo, and I could still smell the rather intense John Frieda fragrance.  It's not BAD by any stretch, but it's definitely a strong scent.I was really surprised when I dried my hair.  The grays were a light blondish brown -- like highlights.  The rest of my hair was soft and so shiny I couldn't believe it was from a drugstore product.  I LOVE how natural it looks.  And this was even though I shampooed again AFTER using it.  A few of my grays are still shinier than the others but it looks totally multitonal and natural.Today I washed my hair again and did not use the glaze, curious to see if it completely washed out.  To my delight it did not!  My grays are still beigey golden brown, and my hair is still so shiny and soft.  I will use it again next shampoo, using less product than before and not shampooing after.  I also am planning to try the other Brunette treatments -- the deepening color treatment and the gloss.  I will be so happy if I can grow out all my damaged hair and blend the gray ones -- all without an allergic reaction!  I honestly don't mind doing this every shampoo if I can continue to have these results and allow my hair to regrow without the damage of regular dye.  I will update with more as I continue use.  I have a feeling you can build the color with this.  (I've seen a YouTube video of a woman who turned her salt and pepper hair brown using the Frieda brunette shampoo and conditioner ONLY, so I'm kind of intrigued to just make this brunette line my go-to.  She had far more gray than I do, and it looked really natural and pretty light brown after using the shampoo and conditioner for a month.  I didn't even know the shampoo and conditioner deposited color.)I did not notice even a hint of orange in my hair.  Even in bright sunlight it's golden chocolate BROWN.  I'm thrilled. YMMV but I give this a hearty thumbs up.  Try it!UPDATE: May 19, 2019Okay, this line is incredible.  I added the Brunette deepening shampoo, as well as the Brunette multi-tone conditioner and I don't think my hair has looked this good in decades.  I've only washed and treated my hair four times and I feel like it is a million miles away from where it was before I discovered the line.I use the glaze before I shampoo, leaving it on for 5-10 minutes like I would regular hair color.  I wash it out with the Brunette deepening shampoo, letting the shampoo itself sit in my hair for another 3-5 minutes.  (The shampoo is also color-depositing, but it doesn't stain your scalp and hands like the glaze does.)  It's easy to let the products do their thing while I do the rest of my thing in the shower.After that, I condition with the multi-tone conditioner, rinse, and get out of the tub.  My hair is so close to the color it was before I started messing with hair dye that invariably always turns brunette hair orange.  I don't have that weird red tint most dark colors give you, even if they call themselves brown and even if they call themselves COOL brown.  My grays are now dark golden/caramel without a hint of red, and the rest of my brown hair is silky and dark chocolate brown.  I've had so many compliments on my hair in the last week it's WEIRD.  And instead of feeling straw-like and crunchy like when I used to color it, my hair is soft soft soft and shiny like my 14 year old daughter's hair.  I haven't had to use a de-frizz spray or argan oil or leave-in conditioner.I also bought the John Frieda Go Blonder no peroxide no ammonia shampoo and conditioner to see if I can get my ends looking sunkissed while the top of my graying head gets darker.  (Multiple uses really does build color!)  At the very least, I don't need to let the ends go any darker, and if I can bring out some of the highlights with no peroxide, it will be great.The key to using all of these products for me is to let the stuff sit on my head long enough to work.  And they WORK!!!  I honestly never thought something like this would work so well!A note about the fragrances of the shampoo and conditioner:  The deepening shampoo is a sweet floral that is not as strong as the glaze.  The multi-tone conditioner (I couldn't find the deepening conditioner) smells so much like THierry Mugler's fragrance Angel,  I would almost call it a dupe.  I happen to adore that fragrance so I was happy!  If you like modern fragrances like Angel, Alien several of the recent Calvin Klein fragrances or even the timeless Chanel #5 then I think you'd like it.  All of the fragrances are fairly strong (except for the shampoo) but all fade to a delicate level after rinsing in the shower.  I don't feel like I've dumped perfume on my head, and it's not cloyingly floral or citrus.I still haven't tried the deepening treatment or the brunette gloss, but both bottles are now waiting for me to try them.  I'll see which is my favorite of the three -- gloss, glaze or deepening treatment.  Upon inspection, the deepening treatment looks more coffee, less chocolate in tone so it might be really good for the very top of my head where the gray is (WAS!) most prominent.I am overjoyed to have found this stuff. Don't stop making it EVER, John Frieda!!!July 17, 2019 update:My hair has honestly not looked this good since my 20s. All gray is caramel golden. My brunette is deep chocolate and all of my hair is so shiny and healthy. I’m using the entire line and I will do so as long as John Frieda keeps making these incredible products. I’mIncluding a picture to show off! I bought this to try and cover up some hi-lights that I got that were a little too blonde. It is working great for putting a little more brown into my hair, but the scent is not great and it tends to leave my hair smelling like that. Overall, I still like it and will continue to use it but I think the scent is something that could bother some. Works great in my hair. But be very careful in your bathroom. A blob of the gloss fell in my tub and it's now stained. I wiped it up pretty quick but it stained almost immediately on contact. Plan accordingly. Followed the hype trend on trying this. Not a color, just clear. Not sure if any better than a product you apply before styling. Maybe the color enhancing is more worth it. My hair has gone almost completely silver and I was getting tired of it, even though it was shiny and healthy looking.  I tried this product (John Frieda colored-conditioner) and love it.  It gradually returns your hair to more blended tones. It does wash out if you don’t like it anymore.  Great product👍 I usually have pretty nice hair.  I'm half-Japanese, so my hair is a dark brown yet behaves like silky Asian hair.  Normally this sounds great, considering my American friends are always straightening their hair like crazy to tame it, while mine stays flat.  The bad thing is, my hair lacks volume, dimension, and texture.  It's super smooth, lays flat, and doesn't want to do anything else.  Curling my hair is a pain, as is getting the roots to fluff up.  I usually wake up looking like someone dumped water on my hair and it dried that way.So I figured the best thing I could do is go with what I had and work it.  I'm getting ready for a trip to California and I want my hair glossy and sleek - ready to combat the dry, sun-drenched and salty air.  So I bought this on Amazon and gave it a shot.According to the instructions (which were missing from the box, by the way), you shampoo and condition your hair like normal.  Then squeeze out as much water as you can and apply the gloss.  It's the consistency of shampoo, but opaque dark brown with golden sparkles in it.  You're supposed to slather this all over your hair from roots to tips.  Problem is, dry hair doesn't allow product to spread very well.  Especially with long, mid-back length hair.  I ended up using quite a bit of product (about 2 good squeezes, maybe 1/12 of the bottle).Immediately my hands stained, and I freaked out when it didn't come off.  I rubbed the product all over my hair and put it up in a clip.  Then (I was thinking ahead here!), I put on a shower cap so the brown product wouldn't drip down my back and leave a drip stain.  Then I finished up my shower, shaved, and came back to my hair.  This time, I flipped my hair upside down to wash out the gloss.  No way I was letting it wash down my back.I lightly towel dried it, but some still rubbed off on my white towels.  It wasn't until I used the hairdryer that I noticed the gloss was working.  My hair didn't tangle or frizz up.  It looked a bit shinier and was really smooth to the touch.  It also gave my hair volume, which was nice!What it didn't do was emphasize the brunette or dimensions of my hair.  The added shine was probably...I'd say...my hair was about 25% shinier.  But it was much softer and fluffier than before.PROS:- actually gives your hair some shine- lays your wild hairs flat and smooth- adds volume!  yaaaaaayyyy!!!- detangles instantly- smells nice (mild coconut-ish?)- gives roots some lift- not terribly expensive- doesn't stain your bathtub- easy to use (3-5 minutes in the shower)CONS:- if you have longer than shoulder-length hair, you use a lot- stains your hands a tiny bit (scrub like a mad person to remove)- stains your white bath towels a bit (bleach like crazy to remove)- a bit pricey considering you're supposed to use it dailyOVERALL:I'd buy this again, but I'm docking it a star because for a daily use product, this stuff is expensive.  I might get 10-12 uses out of it.  Considering I wash my hair daily (again, oily Japanese hair), this would break the bank.  The more you use it, the more shine it adds.  But I'll save this for a weekly routine to revitalize my hair.  The shine really isn't that noticeable.  If your hair looked awful before (from dying, or sun damage, or saltwater damage), then this might be for you.If you take good care of your hair, and you have a deep brunette color like me, this isn't going to create miracles.  I like the volume, so I'll use it when I go on dates with my boyfriend or special occasions.  But certainly not a daily use item.UPDATE:I also bought the John Frieda Shine Shock Gloss from Amazon.  You might want to check out that review to see what Gloss vs. Glaze is.  I got two very different results. I bought it to use in between hair coloring. It does add shine.  The longer I leave the product on the better the shine, I like it. Love using this between coloring, only problem is it stains the hands",1,1,0

Wow, my hair has never looked this good from blow drying before. I have naturally curly hair. The hair itself is not thick, but I have a lot of hair. When I blow dry it just regularly, I end up with a big puffball on my head. I tried using other brushes and the concentrater tool on the hair dryer and it helps, but I still need to go over it with a flat iron to smooth it out if I'm going to wear it down. With this brush I couldn't believe 1) how fast my hair dried! With my previous round brush (which was smaller), I separated my hair into small sections, and would have to go over each section for a while to get it completely dry. The spot on the back of my head seemed impossible to dry. With this brush I used bigger sections and I really only needed to go over the section twice to get it completely dry! I did my whole head really quickly. And 2) I loved the end result! It came out pretty smooth, yet fluffy and voluminous. The tops is straight and the ends have a slight curve or flip to them, not a full curl and not pin straight. I was so excited after the first time using it that I had to come write a review. What a time saver. I can dry and style my hair in one step and I'm guessing I'll be able to get 3 days out of it, maybe a 4th if I wear it up. Flat irons make my hair flat and stringy that the most I can get is 2 days out of it. And to wear it natural takes a lot of time and product to make my curls look like curls rather than a frizzball, then it only lasts day. Maybe now I can actually grow my hair out. I've been keeping it about shoulder/collar bone length because anything longer just took forever to dry and style. If you have hair like mine, definitely get this brush!UPDATE: When I wrote the original review, I didn't have any product in my hair. If I add leave in conditioner and some straightening heat protectant, my hair comes out even smoother and softer. Love it. Also, if I want a straighter look, I'll use this brush to dry my hair, and then flat iron only the bottom half of the hair strands. This way you keep the volume at the roots. I couldn't do this before because the roots were too frizzy that I'd need to flat iron them. Plus, like I said, my hair dries faster using this brush, so I pretty much use it everytime I dry my hair. When I received this brush, ok firstly it is HUGE. I was worried that it'd be too big for even my hair length. I was also worried that it'd damage my hair. Some of the bristles were misshapen from shipping, and it seemed quite rough. I was starting up a proper hair care routine again and I really didn't want to fall at the first hurdle by ripping out more hair with this!I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect, it was very dry and impossible to de-tangle. By the time I'd managed to detangle it, styling was the last thing I wanted to be doing.I used it today after a few days in of my new regimen, which means that my hair was a lot easier to handle than before. Even so, I don't think my hair type is particularly easy to handle even when it's been cared for. This brush is a GODSEND. The size was just right for my length (I would not recommend for anyone shorter than shoulder length because it really is very big) and it cut down the time it took to blow-dry my hair by 3/4. Usually it takes me a good hour to do a BAD job, and by then I want to go to bed, haha. The brush is quite heavy due to it's size, but as I wasn't using it for very long that wasn't an issue. I didn't even have to use a very powerful or hot dryer; I was using my partner's which is a terrible travel hair dryer and my hair still came out all yummy and smooth. I don't even need to run my straighteners through it either which is unheard of for me.If you've got long unruly hair that just doesn't like to be blow-dried, buy this, it really is worth it. I gave it 4* because of the bent bristles issue; I'm a little worried about how long it will last but frankly for the convenience alone this is a fantastic investment. Adds more body to thinner hair. This is actually a salon brush that, for whatever reason, is available by this one seller on Amazon and nowhere else. This brush, though really light weight, is remarkably balanced. It really doesn't feel awkward to hold, despite its size. Its size makes it easier to dry layered hair that wants to fly away as you pull down through the length of longer layers. This brush isn't ideal for really short hair, but works on my shortest layers, a few inches past my shoulder, and would definitely work on even shorter layers.. in fact, I think that would really cut drying time.The bristles are firm enough to grab hair, yet I can give a good swipe against my neck behind my ear or even near my jaw and its ok. So you definitely have some learning room to get use to the brush. Being able to grab my hair really says a lot because, though my hair is fine, its wildly full.. I mean wild. My hairdresser rarely sees hair so full. So I have a lot of it. I think that This brush would work well for many hair types.That being said, though my hair is fine, its not really subject to the brush pulling my hair out if it meets the grip of the handle. Theres a bit of a tug but plenty warning to just loosen the hair and its really easy just don't keep wrapping your hair on the handle and it wont keep pulling. Its designed in such a way this is rarely an issue for me, which says a lot because I have curly hair which means a lot of fly aways.This brush is remarkably well ventalated, probably because of its size. It would probably be even better if the top of the brush had vent holes, like some brushes do.  Also, there's a part pick in the handle. That might be nice for some people, though I don't use it. Its really easy to access and has a flat portion so it doesn't roll away. The size of the brush is perfect for the length of my hair. It's easy to hold considering the size and is a quality brush. If you have curly or coarse hair and use the ceramic part for straightening, it doesn't get hot enough to straighten. Overall, a great brush I would recommend.",2,5,-3

I loved the size and it felt weightless. I heated up great.  My only wish for this item is that it came in a little bit of a bigger wave.  It felt more like a crimper. I used it at the beach so i was ok with that but if you were looking for true beach waves this might not be for you easy to use and not too big. perfect for a quick straighten This product works well and smoothes my hair really well BUTTTT it doesn’t stay straight and smooth. Love this for travel heats up very fast gives get curls the size is just perfect for carry in purse to work to freshen up your hair for going out the only problem was that the clips for rollers were hard to find so i included a pictures of where u can find the clips so more customers won’t have to call customer dervice So after the other irons failed I ordered the first one I actually glanced at but thought Conair they’re intobigger and better items.  How good could this little product be? So I bought it. It was delivered and I openedthe box and the waver was so small!  It’s adorable! The quality excellent and of course I had to try it right away. OMG it’s just what I was looking for.  I have short layered hair and it gives super defined waves and most of all for me it doesn’t DRY YOUR HAIR while waving! Also you can get pretty close to your scalp without burning it. It’s a gem! I would recommend this definitely!!  Hard to use. This little Conair mini smoothing brush does the job for my mid length bob.  Takes care of frizzies and finishing my hair after blow drying.  Would buy again!,1,3,-2

Dryer is quite hotter than my previous one. I'd prefer more air and a little less heat. That's just a preference however, not really a defect of the product. The ""cool shot"" feature isn't really cool. It just reduces the power. It's almost the same as using it on low. The other drawback is if I accidentally get it to close, my long hair gets sucked into the back. Overall it's a good hair dryer and works well but I think I'll use it in my travel bag and get a different one for daily use Works as advertised, second one of this model the first one 3-4-5 years? switch became intermittent. The hair dryer is small and hence doesn’t take up a lot of space in the suitcase. It’s light weight. But it works well and powerful.  It dries my thick, coarse long hair in about the same time (<10 mins) as my $500 powerful hair dryer I use at home.  For 240 v electricity (Europe), you have to keep the ‘low setting’ on this dual voltage machine. And it still is this powerful. If you’re looking for a lightweight travel hair dryer, this is the one! I’m so impressed with how powerful it is, and how quickly I’m able to dry my bangs, which come out very soft! I let the rest of my wavy curly hair dry naturally. The lightweight feature is the best, I’m no longer using my heavy regular size hair dryer anymore. Another feature I like is how the handle folds back so it’s not only easier for travel, but also fits better in my bathroom drawer! I highly recommend! It's cute and small but it's better than a ton of the others out there Bought it for my upcoming trip to Europe. It’s powerful. Power of unit This dryer is just what I was looking for:  small and powerful.  Hope it lasts longer than my previous ones that were another popular brand.",3,4,-1

It’s the only hairspray I know of that can hold a style/curls with just a light spray. It feels natural—never stiff or sticky. Did I mention the hold is incredible? :) Tip: give the spray nozzle a quick rinse with water after each use to prevent it from potentially clogging. Best hairspray ever.

provided for use at the resort we visited in Jamaica.  I loved it so much that I ordered one for myself before we even left to return home!  It heats up immediately and is so quick to finish off my hair.  I love it. This CHI iron was as expected from the brand, and was a replacement for a very old CHI model and another brand  of straight iron that was consistently snagging my hair and burned my hands when I didn't use gloves.  This CHI seemed to be just the right temperature (392) for smooth, straight locks, but didn't burn my  hands when I used it (without gloves), and it didn't burn my hair.  I didn't really have any of the issues with the cord as some other reviewers (it is long, but it didn't get in my way).  I would recommend this iron for anyone.  My hair is very long and very thick, and I'm able to flat iron all of it (when hair has completely dried) in about 20 minutes.  Do note that there is no temp control (just one temp - 392), but that seems to be the sweet spot, heat wise, to do the job without burning.  Key is to go through each strand quickly twice. Had to replace mine after 16 years of use! It worked perfectly until I accidentally broke the plug-in. Heats quickly. Great for traveling I hope this is real chi. I guess I’ll find out in the long run. This straightener is awesome! Heats up quicker than any straightener I’ve used in the past and am able to style my hair in half the time. This is the second time I bought the Chi straightener. The first one lasted a very long time and I am always happy with the results!! Very pleased Purchased for my daughter.  She really likes how it straightens her",1,5,-4

Will definitely purchase again I have been using this set for years and have loved them until recently. The conditioner seems to be the same, but the shampoo is watery and ineffective.  I have to shampoo twice to feel like I have clean hair. Don't know if it's the vendor or new recipe, but very unhappy to have wasted that much money for something I could have bought at the dollar store. I love the way it makes my hair feel, definitely lighter than those products from shoprite or rite aid, ect. .... it's great for if you just colored your hair and it restores your hair from the damage bleaching or dying does... I don't care for the smell.. it's not a bad smell but I guess it's just preference... I got hair extensions recently, and I love the extensions!!! My hair stylist recommended this line over anything else she had ever tried.This shampoo and conditioner are absolutley perfect for hair extensions, and fine hair that gets tangled within a matter of minutes after combing. This was delievered to me last night, and I used it! I have never had my hair feel this perfect, silky, shiny, tangle free, and more! No matter what I did my real hair always felt stringy and dry, and I never colored my hair!! I always babied it to the max, and still was never able to find a product that this one has done in ONE use!! I mostly have a desk job during the day, so it's not as if I am whipping my hair around like a metal head!!! Within a couple hours the hair underneath where my shirt collar is get so tangled that it takes forever to comb out, among damage being done to the hair because of combing and how tangled it gets. I am also very active, and can comb my hair out perfectly, pull it up in a pony, and then when I take it out it's a tangled mess!! How does this happen?? It's really frustrating.They both smell really good like a tropical flowery-coconut smell, and you only need a little bit of each. I have long hair extensions, and a nickle size drop was more than enough! It makes my hair extensions feel so healthy, and definatly feels like it will prolong the life of them by a good long time!! This also feels like it is so nurishing and moisturizing on my extensions as well as my own hair!The shampoo is sulfate free, which I LOVE because I am going to more natural products as well as reducing the heat I use on my hair. When I used this shampoo I noticed that it didn't get super foamy and lather like other products do. I am guessing this may be do to the ""Sulfate Free"" part. Regardless, I worked it into my hair really good and it was perfect! My hair felt clean and healthy without feeling stripped of the oils and nutrients it needs!I absolutly am SOLD on this product (and I have only used it one time so far!), the price was right on Amazon. You get both the shampoo and conditioner for about $30 with FREE shipping!! If you buy them in a salon, you are looking at $28 a piece! Total save, great deal, worth it!If you have fine, straw like hair that tangles if someone breaths too hard, OR extensions. This is the best product by far! They have many different kinds of ENJOY products, and have something for every hair type!LOVE! First time trying this line. The shipment proved to be quite the mess. The shampoo leaked all over and who knows, truly, how much product was wasted! :( would've returned for an exchange but leaving out of town and didn't have time to wait for replacement my.  I like the way it leaves my hair but the lids are awful and the product clogs in it and I have to rinse it after reach use. Every time I try a new product, I come back to Enjoy. It is the absolute BEST. Nothing makes my hair feel more soft. It smells wonderful. It’s the only shampoo/conditioner I will use. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I love enjoy, it moisturizers my hair like nothing else and have been using it for years. However, this last bottle of shampoo was so watery and did not foam or feel the same on the hair. Either they changed the formula or it’s getting watered down, either way not good :( Made my hair soft and shiny",5,5,0

I love it! Highly recommend..I have shoulder length thick naturally curly hair. 4.5 Stars for this brush. I have thin/fine hair that is also inconsistently wavy & curly, frizzy, and quite a bit of it. In the past, when I'd blow my hair out, it would take a while to do it somewhat thoroughly, although I never felt it was totally thorough so I'd do a curling iron afterward to get it silkier and smoother. All the old brushes I used were frustrating in one form or another- they would grab my hair too much or not enough, it would take many passes on the same section of hair to get it fully dried and also smooth (although not as smooth as this new Philips brush). I read the reviews and thought the price was fair enough to give it a try even though I had never seen one in person or had it recommended to me. I am so glad I did. I don't know how long this brush will last; I hope a very long time. One thing I noticed was that  I put it in my drawer and one or a few of the white plastic tines was bent when I took it out in the morning. Not a lot, but enough for me to begin storing the brush on its end/head under the sink, so now the bristles don't rest on anything for hours at a time.As for drying my hair and using it- WOW! What a difference. I am really liking this brush, a lot. So far, so good.. It gives a waaaaay better blow out than my previous brushes and has cut the time in half or more. My hair dries faster, more thoroughly, smoother and eliminates the frizz completely. I use no product in my hair at all until afterward (a putty) to tame a few flyaways, but otherwise I don't put anything in it to help with the frizz. Just the brush. And it's pleasant to hold- for the size it's very lightweight.  I can even wrap my hair around the brush completely and my hair doesn't stick to it, it will release just fine. When I wake up the next day, my old blowouts would have become partially undone.. there would be wavy spots again, some frizz, etc. I'd have to touch up again. But not this brush, it does it thoroughly enough that my hair is still smooth all the way until my next wash- I wash my hair about every 3 days +/- depending.I really wish they made this exact same style (the mixture and spacing of bristles and a hallow head) in many more sizes, like 2.5 or 2.75"". Hopefully that is in the works,I am very pleased with this brush and would highly recommend it. I'm relatively new to the straightening of my thick, curly, locks. I had a round brush that was way too small for my big hair. So, I did a little research, and of the brushes on the list, this is the one that looked promising for my needs. I'm so happy I chose this one!First, it's really light weight. The vents in the barrel help with that. I have some injuries that could use that little extra help. Second, those vents! They speed up that drying time! I mean, it still took a while, but a lot less than I'm used to! Third, my hair isn't yanked out! The bristles are lovely to my hair. My hair was relatively smooth on my first try. I mean, for a seriously thick, curly job to tackle, it was up to the task, and very gently at that. Fourth, the big, round brush handled a LOT of hair at once, with those vents, and it actually dried.I really can't say enough good about the brush. I highly recommend this brush!!!The only down side? I love a good head scratch, and with my thick hair, it's difficult for these bristles to get to my scalp. I just pull out my anti static brush and get a little relief. I wouldn't really consider this a down side with all the upsides! I was skeptical about the brush before I purchased it because it's really hard to find a bristle brush that doesn't break my thin fragile hair.  Before I purchased this brush, I would round brush my hair and then have to curl the ends with a curling iron or wand to smooth out the frizz.  After using this brush one time I realized that I don't even have to do anything after round brushing anymore.  I can just dry my hair and go.  Which is half the damage that I was previously doing to my hair.  My hair will look smooth for a couple of days before needing to be washed and re-styled now.  I have also been using a microfiber towel (Mimi's Diva Dryer by Aquis Microfiber Hair Turban) in conjunction to this brush and my hair seems a lot happier.  Thanks Amazon! I use a flat iron a lot and it was really damaging my hair.  My hair is also fine so maintaining body is a hard thing to do.  So after doing some research and thinking about going back to the old school of using a round brush to dry my hair, I ran across a video where a hairdresser was using one of these brushes and her results were exactly what I was looking for.  I mainly let my hair air dry and then blow it out using this brush.  Very much pleased with the results.  My hair is medium length it doesn't get tangled in my hair. Hands down my favorite round brush! I purchased it 12 years ago, and it got tired and decided to quit. I bought this one to replace. I love the vent. I love that it is wood, and has boar bristles. (My hair tends to get caught in the seams of the metal brushes) I've never had a brush perform better than this one! Alright people let me tell you, this brush changed my life. Honestly. I have really thick wavy hair and I typically like to blow dry it straight using a cylinder hairbrush but my hair always gets super tangled and I have to stop blow drying and go back in and brush and repeat the process but not anymore my friends. Not anymore! I never realized how crappy my old brush was until I got this one. Literally not a single knot or tangle blow drying my entire head of hair (and there's a lot of hair) and it only took me 10 minutes whereas before it could take up to 40. So basically buy this brush you won't regret it",4,4,0

This holds up when it rains and love how it is a dark auburn shade. This works beautifully and so grateful for the pricing of this incredible product. I also use it at fill in for brows. Covering the gray. Been using 30 years Got this for my mother. It did take a bit longer to arrive due to covid delays. It was going to arrive after the event anyway so it wasn’t a huge deal. It was in a large package presumably so it wouldn’t get lost in the mail. My mother bought this brand about 10 years ago and it matched her hair perfectly and the old stick was sadly discolored from age, so I made this purchase for her. She was very pleased! The old stick needed water to be added, but this product didn’t require any extra effort. There was moisture in it, so it could just be easily applied as is! She was very happy with it! Produto maravilhoso. Recomendo. I have used everything you can imagine to cover up my increasingly salt and pepper roots. Dying my hair every two weeks is definitely not an option. My hair is dyed auburn -- a medium shade. My mother, aunts and sister all used this -- it's been around for years. Compared to other products, this price is very reasonable, and it lasts for some time. The Auburn is always first to sell out at beauty supply stores, so I'm now getting it from Amazon.I'm also a fan of the much more expensive Joan Rivers product, but Roux Tween Time Hair Crayon is great in a pinch, and the price speaks for itself. Very highly recommended. Follow directions and you will not be disappointed. Don't waste your money. This stick doesn't cover very well.  I thought this would be a soft, creamy stick that would be easy to apply, but it is hard and difficult to work with.  You need to wet it first, then it is a struggle to get the color on your hair.  You need to press very hard; it hurts your hair.  I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because the color does get on your hair so I can't say it doesn't work at all.  There are better products out there.  Try the ones that come in a tube with a wand. There are a few different brands of the liquid type on Amazon.  Buy those instead, they are all good. A friend of ours suggested this product when she heard my wife complaining about the silver edges around her temples and forehead.  I decided to surprise her and order the Time Hair Crayon.  I didn't really know what color to get or if it would work, but I made a pretty good guess.  She wasn't sure about it to start with, but now she is talking about ordering more just to have them on hand in case she misplaces the one I got her.  From my wife's expression each time I see her looking at her hair in the mirror, I would suggest the Tween Time Hair Crayon to anyone who wants to keep that younger look between now and the next salon visit.",2,5,-3

(If that’s even a smell). LolFollowup with their conditioner important for me and NOT getting the conditioner too much on the scalp is super helpful.I also use their gel and smoothing balm. No crunch, no heavy weight. Gel is a tiny bit flaky if I don’t smooth out evenly or if I use too much. I am a long-time user of this natural ingredient shampoo. I originally started using it bc I wanted to reduce the number of chemicals I put on my scalp and in our waterways. I normally order the bulk size bottles of this and its companion conditioner (32oz botttles) straight from the Max Alchemy website. However, I don't use the heavy conditioner in the summertime.The scent of this shampoo ranges from herbal to citrusy, depending on the batch. This last bottle was citrus-scented, but the scent goes away fairly quickly after your hair is dry. It takes a splash of water on your head after the shampoo and then you can work it down to the roots (bc there is no chemical ingredient just to make it foamy, like in cheap shampoos). Does a wonderful job of getting my hair clean but does not strip the hair of all of its natural oils. It is mid-priced for shampoo, but definitely a value for a shampoo that cleans gently and uses plant-derived ingredients. I tried the baking soda apple cider vinigar 'no poo' in the past (on and off for about 6 months) ; too inconvenient and then I read several articles on how it was horrible for your hair long term. Then I tried Hugo Naturals since it was cost effecitve but it left a residue in my hair I got tired of trying to correct, so I retired it to a body wash. Went back to whatever conventional shampoo was in the house.  For some reason I developed notoicable white flakes in my hair conventional dandruff shampoo wasn't helping with, so I tried this after a search on Amazon for ""organic dandruff shampoo"". I liked that it was vegan and the ingredients were plant based, and it also was advertised as helping with scalp issues. Upon usage, I noticed it has a strong citrus smell (which may put some people off) and lathred just like regular shampoo which was nice.Unfortunalty, it has done nothing for my dandruff after using for about 2 monthes (bought in October, stopped early December). It also leaves my hair with a waxy feeling like Hugo Natruals did though sometimes an acv rinse helped. But having to do experiments (including rewashing my hair) was something I was trying to get away from. To be fair I have straight, fine hair that doesn't take well to cream conditionair or natural oil treatments either (just tried olive oil for the dry scalp skin and had to wash my hair 3 times!) so maybe there are too many plant oils or somethng (it is a thick consistancy) for me.So, if you are prone to product build up or are looking for a dandruff solution skip this. But if you are just wanting to try a 'greener' shampoo solution and don't mind citrus or the price, it's worth considering. I have very frizzy, dry, damaged short hair. I bleached my hair for a couple years and when I finally went back brown I had so much damage that i had to cut most of it off. Even so, I still had about 2 or 3 inches of damaged hair. I would have cut it all off but i'm a big girl and was too afraid to do a pixie cut. Anwyway, lately it's been bothering me how terrible it looks. So I started doing coconut oil treatments which helped alot but knew i needed to swtich to something organic since I had already done so much damage with chemicals. My process: Coconut oil treatment for at least a couple hours. Use organic! Read up on the benefits of coconut oil if you are hesistant trust me you won't regret it. Then I followed up with Max Green Alchemy Scalp Rescue Shampoo. I had done many coconut oil treatments but it always seemed I could never get it all out. This shampoo well ensure its all out. It will feel similar to a anti-residue shampoo which sort of scared me but I moved on to the Max Green Alchemy Scalp Rescue Conditioner next. I let it sit rinsed then used two leave in products that I always use. (side note: I always use the leave ins and have been doing the oil enough to know the difference this product made was astounding) Anyway, I used It's a 10 leave in silk conditioner and Redkin extreme anti-snap. Then I used my blowdryer. I attached a picture of what my hair looks like with this added to my arsenal. I really love the fact that it cleans my scalp but leaves my hair soft and conditioned. The shampoo is worth the price. have no idea of how it's supposed to be a ""SCALP RESCUE""every shampoo claims that in one way or anotheri just like to use iteven though its too expensive Man oh man did I like this stuff. It left my hair so soft and clean even in hard water and I didn't have to use a conditioner with it. It foamed up nicely - a little went quite a long way but the product is very thick so I recommend splitting it between both hands and then going at your hair from the front and back at the same times, spreading it out before you work it in. This shampoo definitely improved my dandruff situation but because it turns out I am sensitive to aloe vera, I still had some dandruff and it eventually caused me to break out a little around my hair line (nothing too bad but annoying enough). The smell is lovely - a soft, sweet lemon smell - and the bottle will last for quite a while (based on medium long and average amount/thickness of hair). The packaging and product are quality and overall it was a delight to use, but if you're sensitive to any of the ingredients, it is probably a no go for long term use.",4,4,0

I had a friend who had cancer and used this to regrow her hair, and it works.  I only use this shampoo.  I don't care what it smells like or if it gives volume, it works! Love this brand and the peppermint scent and tingle Hard to tell if it's working but I keep using it hoping I won't lose any more hair.  I like the shampoo.

I have been using this product for over a week and it works for me I bought #4 for color treated and thinning hair. The writing on the bottle of shampoo has what appears to be correct labeling.  Then underneath it says shampooing.  I've bought a lot of nioxin products (.shampoo) and it was never labeled  like this.. What did I buy??? I just finished my first bottle of this that I ordered on 8/29/21. It lasted 6 entire months of shampooing almost every day. My hair is noticeably thicker. My husband even commented that it looks thicker! The product doesn’t have much of a scent but I use a different conditioner for softness and scent. I also color my hair and this shampoo doesn’t seem to strip my color at all. I’m really happy with the results and just ordered another bottle.",1,1,0

My hair is pretty curly so it often takes quite a few of them to secure it, but that's not much of an issue since there are 12 in the box. They don't snag or get caught like pretty much every other kind of clip or hair tie does, so that's a huge plus. This is a good product for a fine price, I think it works just as it should. I was all ready to go on & on about HOW GREAT these 12 hair clips are...  I LIKED THEM,  my first purchase revealed quality.  NOW I see a significant price increase without anything more on their part to warrant such an action.  So my review has dimmed one of the stars (to just 4).  I will NOW focus on where I SHOULD HAVE SHOPPED.... because it is too late to cancel this order! Love using these to keep my bangs out of my face while doing my makeup or washing my face. The clips stay put in my hair and don't snag at all. They are also super comfortable and I sometimes forget they're in my hair. They don't leave creases or marks in my hair whatsoever and the quality is really good for the price.  Best of all you get 12 clips total! I can have backup clips every I go. I love these clips. I have curly hair, about 2c-3a, and I ordered these to add lift at my roots while my hair dries. They work really well, although for my purpose I probably should have ordered the smaller clips (alligator clips I think). I do keep losing them, but that is my fault. Either keep the box to store them or give them a special place because they will disappear! PROS:- Holds my silky, slippery hair.CONS:- The hinge part pulled out my hair when I removed a clip. I don't want to lose any hairs! I'm a little afraid to use them. Considering my hair is smooth and straight, it wasn't like my hair was all over the place and got caught in a freak accident.OVERALL:Since they hold, and I already have them, I will try to use them carefully. But you know, when you're styling and reaching around awkward parts of your head, you can't always be careful. I'd rate these as second best choice, seeing as the hold is good. (Try to find best choice!) I purchased these clips to help me style my hair now that its quite a bit longer than I'm used to. I use it to section off my hair while blow drying , straightening, or curling it. They hold a decent amount of hair quite well and don't leave big crease marks in my hair. I use these just about every day and they're a big help in getting my hair done quickly. I've never been able to use these kinds of clips because my hair is so thick that it falls out of them, or I have to use at least 10 clips to hold up half my hair while drying. These clips were amazing, I only need a couple to put up my hair for an at home blowout! I use them constantly, when doing house work, when I'm cooking & need hair out of my face, when I'm washing my face. They've almost completely replaced my claw clips! These are definitely a steal! I have long fine hair so when I curl it I need to pin up the curls to cool. These are great. No clamp marks and they are nice and long. My only trouble is when I pull some of them out, my hair tends to get caught around the end and gets tangled. I consider this a user error not a product error!  I will certainly be ordering more in the future.",5,4,1

Makes the hair feel like butter This stuff is AMAZING. Sellers will jack up the price even with repeat customers. Great product if you can purchase at a good price. Thank you for this, I love it and makes my hair feel so soft. I absolutely love this stuff! I am African-American and have relaxed hair. Finding a staple deep conditioner was a little bit hard for me. Most of the conditioners I tried from stores just seemed ""okay"" to me... they would provide a lot of slip while on my hair but after rinsed off I don't think they were improving the actual condition of my hair. They were more like coating it, if you know what I mean. I bought and have been using this for a while now (deep conditioning 1x a week, leave on 1-2 hours) and I see a genuine improvement in my hair's condition. There is less breakage, more strength, and it holds on to moisture better. Even though this isn't necessarily advertised as a moisture conditioner, it moisturizes my hair. I also like the weird texture of this stuff. I don't know how to describe it exactly. It isn't creamy like normal conditioners... it is very gooey, slimy, and stringy if that makes sense lol. But not in a bad way! I have tons of hair and this spreads very well throughout my hair without me having to use 1000 pumps/squirts like I do with other conditioners. Amazing product! I will use this for as long as it is in production! It is worth the price to me because the bottle is huge and a little goes a long way. I also get to stop wasting money on trying new conditioners all the time. Only this from now on! I have yet to find it in a store but I'm in L.A so it has to be in one of the millions of beauty supply stores out here. The product is good for deep conditioning your hair. It has it manageable and gives more volume. This product leaves your hair feeling silky, smooth and light. I love this product. This product works like a charm with the relaxer!! I’m so ecstatic about it and can’t wait to use it again. My hair felt silky and smooth and was just overall beautiful. It’s not my first time self relaxing but it’s the first time it felt so healthy afterwards. I will definitely be buying again. It's a very good conditioner especially if your hair is really bad this can bring it out and makes your hair look good it's very good has a lot of fibers in it which is good for your hair and all I can say is good things about this product just try it for a month and see what she's on I give it a 10",5,5,0

So it’s very subtle, but came out great. Can definitely see that it’s purple and my ends are lighter purple so it looks really fun.Just a warning that it’s messy. Takes so long to rinse out. And I had to bleach the shower curtain and tub after. I use conditioner after washing and that seems to be keeping it off my pillows and clothes. I only got one white shirt very purple but I think it was due to sweat. So wear darker clothes it the beginning. Decided to go gray about a year ago but wanted to have a little fun along the way.  I diluted the product with conditioner and applied to dry hair for 15 min.  Really love the way it came out and excited to try more colors! The color is beautiful, and the pigment is amazing.  It’s a beautiful warm toned purple/violet. The color lasted FOREVER. It never 100% left my hair actually lol. My only issue is the bleeding. For the first week after coloring it’s going to bleed badly. If you can live with that then you’ll love this dye. I liked the product.  The color was a bit brighter than I expected. And that was without bleaching my hair first. The color did wash out with each shampoo. And lasted about 2 1/2 weeks with washing every 3-4 days. I didn't need to use the whole jar on one application and have plenty left over for use later. I'll be buying more colors to play with. Why not? People tell me to act my age. But I've never been this age (57) so how am I supposed to act? I love Manic Panic colors.  I have used several of them to highlight my progressively white hair.  I get so many compliments on the blues and purples although I need to dilute them so they are not too intense compared to my black hair. I'm honestly shocked at the reviews that said this didn't stick in their hair. It stuck, and I mean stuck, to mine much longer than I anticipated.I had dark brown hair with sort of a blonde balayage/highlights thing going on. I left the dye in for 45 minutes, 15 minutes longer than the recommended time - I did this because I wanted it to stick to my dark hair. When I washed it out and dried my hair, I could see the purple but it wasn't terribly noticeable. I actually really liked it because my dark brown looked almost black, and the blonde was a dark purple and I loved the combination. It also smelled really nice after the first wash, which I wasn't used to for unnatural hair dyes. It didn't rub off too much on my clothes that first night, and the dye was pretty easy to get off my skin.Fast forward to the next day and back to my normal shower routine. This stuff bleeds and stains and makes a mess. I have purple splatter stains all over my tub and wall. But that's the price you pay for unnatural hair color!After this wash, the dye does as promised and gets a little lighter. I kind of wished I dyed my hair a few days earlier because THIS color was the purple I was looking for. It was more vibrant and stood out more since it was a bit lighter.Fast forward a few more washes - I was expecting this stuff to be gone within 1.5 weeks with some hot water/heavy shampooing routines. That did not happen. The dye transformed with each wash and I've been pleasantly surprised with the colors. I'm almost two weeks in now and it's still a vibrant purple with some strands a little lighter, and some almost magenta. It's like a purple rainbow of colors, something I couldn't get if I tried. It's no longer staining my tub, that ended after about 2-3 days. It's not rubbing on my skin or clothes either.I was expecting this stuff to fade fast due to some reviews, the fact that my hair wasn't bleach blonde, and also due to the unnatural color. This stuff stuck better than some professional dye jobs.I am for sure using this brand again for fun colors. Before:My hair has been dyed red for years now.  The current state when I used this dye went as follows.  My roots were baby hair so no bleach and dark brown, right below this was a faded reddish brown, it fades all the way down to a lighter reddish brown/blonde.  Setting up was easy, just follow the directions, watch a youtube video, prep is like normal, cover hands/clothes/area/anything you don't want to get dye onDuring:The texture is great, easy to apply.  I wish it came with gloves and a dying hair brush.  I didn't have gloves so I improvised with cleaning gloves.  (very annoying to use) other than that things went pretty smoothly.  One bottle was enough to cover all my hair and I have very long hair.  After setting for an hour, I washed my hair out.  I recommend washing it in a sink first or over the tub, not in the shower because the dye will get everywhere. Clean as you go so it doesn't stain.  I used regular shampoo and conditioner because nothing was included.  I think they should include a leave in color treatment.After:  My hair was basically a reddish purple.  It just barely darkened what it already was. The ONLY purple i saw was on my ends which were initially a tad blonde from bleach.  It only lasted a maximum of 2 weeks.  Every time I brushed my hair, or put my hands in my hair my hands would turn purple.  That was seriously annoying.  My hair was not damaged so that was good.All in all I would recommend this product if you have blonde or bleached hair and are only looking to see what something else looks like on you before using a more permanent dye. I got purple haze. I put it on my hair after a bleachwash and there was still some red/pink in my hair, which was fine as I prefer purple the leans that way.I got indigo. Like there is a LOT of blue. My results look like the listing for violet night, not the pinkish purple shown for purple haze. I will say the camera makes it look less blue than it is, but it is really dark and my hair was around a level 8-9 before I put it on.",2,4,-2

I was I guess expecting it to come in a box or something, but it came in a blister pack style package with a big ""AS SEEN ON TV"" emblem on the top.  For me, that emblem doesn't make me think quality. Not that I thought this was going to be amazing quality for the price, but as a gift it kinda gave off a 'I bought this on my way over at Walgreens' feel.HOW IT WORKSYou take a lock of hair, place it in the groove that is sticking off the circle and pull the trigger. It puts the jewel in the lock of hair. My niece had absolutely no problems operating it and within 10 minutes the entire family was bejeweled.REMOVALI've seen other reviews that say they were hard to get out, but they didn't seem to be for us.  My daughter, my SIL and my niece all put them in and removed them without any complaint. The jewels are then reusable for another application. They are small though and can easily get lost, but you can buy replacements by themselves: I nearly didn't buy this product because someone here on amazon stated ""ouch"" that it was spring loaded and will pull hair out when removing. Well, my comment on that is BRUSH YOUR HAIR! If your hair is brushed you should have no issues removing this product. All you do is pull the gems apart and slowly pull to take them out. You can't tell me you've never had a hair pin tug at your hair once in awhile when trying to remove, or even a hair tie at that.Now this product is a bit annoying in the beginning. It doesn't come with the batteries installed you will need your own batteries. The annoying part is the compartment to put the batteries in are closed with a screw. Which ok no biggie right? Wrong...the screw is sooooo tiny a regular Phillips will not do the job. You need a very thin tipped Philips to get the job done. If you do not have this handy you will not be able to use your product right away. This is why I take away 1 star. If it wasn't for this I would've given it a 5 star rating.Once you get past that part the product is very simple and easy to use. The jewels come preloaded, however the extra jewels does not come with a case so you will need something to put them in. All you do is take a small strand of hair and place it in the hook area. You need to hold your hair into the compartment and simply push the button and release once the jewel is in place. You don't want to take the strand out till after you let go of the button and the thing that pushes the jewel into the hair goes back into place. I notice if you take the hair out before hand the jewel doesn't really get pushed into place properly.Hope this was helpful! I am so glad I ordered this for my 9 year old Granddaughter for Christmas.  This was a big hit, she loved it.  It's very sturdy and I think will hold up.  Simple to operate. The jewels go onto the hair easily, my granddaughter very quickly was using it on her own hair and then, her Aunts hair and her big sisters hair😀.  The jewels stay in without falling out, yet when you want to take them out of your hair they come out easily, with no pulling or any hair damage.  What more could you ask?  They look nice in the hair too.It takes 2 AAA battery's to operate and does not come with battery's.  The jewels are very simple to load into the machine.  The price is reasonable.  The 9 year old got many other gifts Christmas Day, but the Conair HJ3BC Quick Gems Hair Jeweler was the big hit, with her.  I have been asked by the 9 year old to please order more gems for her, which thankfully Amazon carrys as well.  So I am happy to order some more.  I ordered this a bit late for Christmas, but happily it was shipped quickly and got to me in time for Christmas.In conclusion, if any one is sitting on the sidelines wondering if this is a good item for a young girl, I would urge you to order one.  It's good quality, easy to use , does not damage the hair at all, very easy to take out of the hair, yet stays in well when applied and the price is reasonable.  I am so happy I got it for my Granddaughter and was so happy to see how much fun she had with it.  I know she is going to wear some ""jewels ""in her hair, the first day back to school after Christmas, and best of all, she will be telling her friends her Nona bought it for her😊",1,3,-2

conditioning, dandruff and dry scalp | Herbal scalp treatment","This grows and moisturizes my hair so well! I love it it’s a staple This is a terrific all natural treatment for hair and scalp. Although it is described as an oil to be poured on the scalp, mine came solidified. This was not surprising due to the cold weather. However, it has not liquefied even at room temperature. Nothwithstanding, it is easy to apply. It does melt in the hand. When solid, it is a dull olive color with a mild herbaceous smell. Once applied, the aroma dissipates. Apply one or two teaspoons and massage into the scalp. You then comb through the hair and leave on for a minimum of two to three hours before washing out. I generally apply it twice a week and leave it on overnight. It washes out easily. I must say I was impressed with the results. My hair is fine and color treated. Over the years it seems to have lost  both its luster and volume. After using this regularly for over a month, my hair looks and feels healthy. There is genuine shine and plenty of body. My hair seems to have grown faster but not thicker. I occasionally get a little snow on the mountain, so to speak and since using, have not noticed any grey. I think this is a good product that can help boost condition and shine. Recommended. This oil is lasting a very long time because I use this oil every other day on my hair. I wash my hair at the end of the week now. I can tell my hair is growing and getting thicker. I usually get an inch of more hair every month, but now it looks like I will be getting an inch and a half now. I don't wash my hair every time I apply this oil in my scalp. I use it like I use the other oils. I spray my hair with water first, then I apply this oil. I can feel tingling in my scalp because I have a sensitive scalp. This oil is mild and works great on sensitive scalp too. I have nothing bad to say about this oil. This oil do not smell good but afterwards the smell fades away. My scalp eats this oil up. I must say I would recommend this oil to others. This oil is like a solid when you get because it has coconut oil in it and that oil sometimes becomes a solid and when it gets warm in your home the oil becomes a liquid. Solid or liquid it can be applied to the scalp. You don't have to was it out either. You can wear it everyday if you want or use it as a hot oil treatment. I feel the longer it stays in your hair the better it works. I use it every other day sometimes twice a day because my scalp is so dry and sensitive. This is like a medicine to my scalp. It stops the itching and hair breakage real well. I have course hair so after a wash, this oil does soften a little. I just apply to the scalp and my ends. I like this oil a lot. I started losing my hair all over my head i am hyperthyroid(graves disease) discovered in jan 2012 at that time I was losing over 1000 hairs a day so I read as much as I could on every review board of products I could find and I chose 2 products sold on amazon brahmi hair oil and organic bhringaraj oil I sleep with it in my hair every other night lord my pillow cases are trashed even to know I rub it in all over my hair scalp massage then use what i put in my scalp to massage into rest of my hair then tie it up in a bun with a hair tie..in feb of 2012 i started taking evening primrose oil 1000mg softgel 3 times a day which is suppose to be very beneficial for thyroid hais loss in  which this really slowed my hair loss down first month to 150 hairs a day 2nd month 60-70 hairs a day to now 20-30 hairs a day fallout...my hair is not growing back yet i rotate the brahmi then next time use bhringaraj oil then i use for a week brahmi again my hair is shiny  and looks healthy but ive had no new re growth it grows faster but has not produced any new hair believe me i look in the mirror every night.I am stable as of my blood test results for hyperthyroid with thyroid meds.some have reported growth on here I wish i could say after 9 months i had some new growth where hair fell out but nothing yet..it keeps my scalp from being dry and feels good when I massage it in..so my review is I have shinier hair in 9 months of use less fall out with my routine of what im doing just no new regrowth at present time this is oct 2012 the scent does not bother me i use oxy cleaner in the wash to help with stains on pillow cases i will keep using because my scalp feels healthy after leaving on overnight I am a white woman, age 26, with wavy hair.  Due to stress, and other factors, I began losing my hair several years ago and recently decided it was time to start growing it back.I've been using this product at the same time as oral supplements for hair re-growth, so I can't say much about its effectiveness on its own.  However, it definitely seems to help.  And in a little less than a month, too!  My hair is growing faster and thicker and I can feel little hairs cropping up on my head in places where there had been just bare skin before.  YES!  I also really like the way it makes my scalp feel - it's much healthier now and less dry/itchy/flaky/dandruff-y.  I store my jar of Brahmi oil inside a plastic ziplock bag in the fridge when I'm not using it.  Then scoop out what I need with a spoon and rub it between my fingers until it melts.  That way I can more accurately measure out how much I plan to use.The problems a few reviewers have complained about, such as shedding, the oil leaving a greasy film on hair and pillowcases, etc., can be avoided by using only a small amount up to three times per week and making sure to wash it out thoroughly.  (And maybe using a pillow cover.)  It's important as well to make sure you follow the directions and MASSAGE the oil into your scalp, don't just rub it on.  Rubbing the scalp can irritate it and lead to shedding.  While some people are bothered by the smell I actually kind of like it.  I find it soothing and I fall asleep faster on the nights when I apply the oil before going to bed.When my jar runs out I'll most certainly buy more if I think I still need it.  :)",4,4,0

Hydrates & Replenishes Dry Hair | Rosa Mosqueta Rose Hip & Argan Oils | 75% Organic Ingredients (11 oz)","I like this conditioner. I never repurchased it but I will say it was ok and I mostly used it for co washing my hair. I used this back when I was trying to figure out what my natural hair liked. OK, let me set the scene with the mess that my hair was before I started my new haircare regime. I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect. It was very dry and impossible to de-tangle and was driving me crazy, nothing was working for it.I bought this conditioner (and the shampoo to match, even though I don't shampoo often) to use regularly as a part of a moisture-only routine as I wanted to avoid using anything with protein added for my 'regular' washes (as opposed to deep conditioning days). I'd read some recommendations of this product online and I liked that it's fairly natural.When I received the actual product and opened the bottle, it smelled pretty disgusting to me; it's very herbal in an unpleasant way, to the point of smelling almost like chemicals, if that makes any sense. When I used the shampoo I was worried because it didn't feel nice on my hair after, and the conditioner didn't really feel like it was doing any good either. Nevertheless, I combed it gently through my hair and rinsed it out at the end of my shower. The smell once it was mixed a little it wasn't quite so bad but I still wouldn't describe it as nice, to my tastes at least.I detangled my hair with a wide-toothed comb and it seemed to be easier than usual. But I didn't notice how incredible my hair felt until I dried it off. I felt like blow-drying my hair which I don't often do, and from the very first section I was stunned at how silky and easily manageable my hair had become again. Seriously I cannot praise this stuff enough; I have not used it long term but for it to have done my hair this much good from one simple sitting, I'm pretty amazed - especially considering how sceptical I was. This product is definitely worth a try considering it's not that expensive, and the bottles aren't exactly small so it will last quite a while.For the good that it does to my hair, I can forgive the smell; it actually doesn't smell at all unpleasant once the hair is dry and if you've applied other products it mixes well - you know that smell your hair gets when you've just been to a salon to get your hair washed, cut etc? That's what it smells like to me after, which is nice lol. If it bothers me when I use it regularly I'll just mix in another oil to make it smell better. The main point is, this stuff works for me and I'm really happy about it!I will say that before I used these two products, I had done a deep cleansing and balancing/conditioning treatment in order to fix the foundations of my hair as much as possible, so this also adds to the reasons why my hair is feeling much better than before. However I do feel that this conditioner and its shampoo really works well with my hair type and I definitely have this product to thank for how well my hair is doing on only day 2 of my routine. I can recommend it to anyone with moisture problems with their hair. A year ago I quit using chemical products in my hair, because of hair loss & damage. I had been using other natural shampoo & conditioners, until they either became unavailable or stripped my hair. I've ordered several different conditioners from Aubrey and love this one the most. It is the scent that is so light & feminine, plus the conditioning power of this stuff id amazing! I put it on with a shower cap an hour before I shower, then shampoo & condition again. When I brush there are no tangles, very little hair loss & my hair is so silky, shiny & full of life! The other day a friend asked if I had dyed my hair because the natural color is coming back out! I also have the shampoo that goes with this condition & it works great to get my hair clean.The softness, shine & life this stuff brings back into you hair is literally amazing.I will not put anything else into my hair again after using these products. The conditioner is thick, yet it does not weigh down hair. I have medium thick, dark, middle of my back Latin hair. This works great for me & my grandmother who has short, dyed hair.The scent isn't too overpowering, and doesn't linger. In my opinion this one smells the best.Update 7/24/13I stopped using Aubrey products in my hair about 6 months ago & started trying out the salon brands (Chi, Sebastian) Chi worked very well in my hair, but the price is so expensive that I couldn't afford to keep buying it. Then I went to store brands like Herbal Essences & Garnier. The only one I have stuck to is Garnier because the ingredients are partially natural & the shampoo doesn't dry my hair out so bad. A few days ago I started using Aubrey conditioner with the Garnier shampoo & my hair is actually softer, shinier, easier to manage & doesn't feel so brittle. When I stopped using Aubrey my hair was getting very brittle, dry & had so much split ends that I had to cut 3 inches off the length. I didn't think it would make a difference if I stopped using Aubrey in my hair and tried something else, but I guess it did, because I didn't change anything else but the product I was using to cleanse & condition my hair. Now I am using Garnier shampoo, Aubrey conditioner & a wonderful whipped mouse from Bamboo. My hair is shiny, silky & less fall out since going back to Aubrey.Everyone's hair & budget are different. If you have great luck with Aubrey that is wonderful, I did have a great experience but after a few months my hair was getting weighed down by the conditioners & I tried about all of them to see which one would stop my hair from being so weighed down. My cousin owns a hair salon and told me to change up my brands of shampoo/conditioner every couple of months to keep my hair from getting weighed down & used to a certain product. I've done that since stopping using Aubrey within the last 6 months & it worked. I have given my hair a break and now am just using the Aubrey conditioner everyday.",5,4,1

and saying they changed the ingredients, they did not. If you'd looked at the AO webpage you would have seen the information as to why the way the ingredients are listed differently. An excerpt from their information is: ""Before we go any further, we MUST clarify one point: Aubrey's natural formulas have NOT changed; only the way our ingredients are listed has. The moisturizer you used two years ago with ingredients listed by their ""common names"" is the same one you will find on store shelves today--the only difference is in the labeling.As Aubrey Organics has grown, we have moved into markets outside of the United States. We have thus found it necessary to adjust the manner in which our ingredients are listed on our labels.INCI, or International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients, is a collaboration between the U.S. Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (now PCPC) and the European Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association. The goal: to establish a uniform, science-based method of ingredients labeling that increases consumer understanding, eliminates language barriers and helps resolve international trade issues. This format (INCI) is the standardized international format for listing ingredients on cosmetic and personal care products.""So, stop wailing that your life and/or hair is ruined. Aubrey is the same as always. It's still an excellent product, just the same as it's always been. Really folks, do a little research before you start running around proclaiming that the sky is falling. You are spreading false information and it's not right.For the rest of you, this is a great line that is ridiculously moisturizing and smells lovely. Give it a try! But I do recommend that you do a clarifying wash at least once a month because the moisture CAN build up over time on certain hair types. I have 4c hair at the crown/top of my head, and 4b in other spots. As a natural woman with not a lot of money to spare at times, I try to watch it when things are costing me well over 9 and 10 dollars. I gave this a shot having heard so many great things and reading the ingredients. The first time I tried it, I did not see the results I wanted. I eventually realized it was the other parts of the regimen I do that made this so. Eventually I tweaked this. I decided to Co-wash only. That's when it happened--I saw the cute little moist curls that I'd been looking for. The only problem? I had to use a LOT of product to get there. I would recommend this come in a larger bottle or have a two-for with a sensible price. While this stuff may not smell THAT good, it DID give me the moisture I wanted. To elevate this, I parted my hair into sections under the water of the shower. After de-tangling with a wide-tooth, I conditioned every section with a quarter-sized amount. The nickel and dime-sizes did not work for me. When I did this, I had amazing results. Loose, moist curls.Now...when it dried, I still had my curls. They were just dry. But my hair was as soft and as shiny as ever. It made my hair very easy to set up for my twist out. As a matter of fact, there were no tangles, no bunches. I just had a really cute, huge afro. All in all, this is not a bad product. It's just a bit pricey and may require some extra amount for some people. If you are trying to find out what works for you, I would recommend putting this on the back-burner for a minute and trying out Kinky-Curly's Knot Today. I have been looking for a conditioner that does something good for my hair other than make it feel nice upon washing the conditioner out. I have long, relaxed African American hair (which is normally somewhat course) and while a lot of the more well-known conditioners are great at doing the latter, they do nothing for my hair once it is dry. It is still either dry, unmanageable, or a combination of the two until it is tamed with other styling products and tools. With the White Camellia conditioner this is not the case. After I use it (I use it as both a regular and deep conditioner), my hair is soft, easy to detangle, and has a nice shine to it. My new growth, which is usually resistant and a hassle to deal with, is soft and easy to style, especially when I need to flat-iron it.The only con is that I'm not too keen on the smell, which is an odd flowery smell that lingers for a few days. However, it is a price I'm willing to pay for a product that improves the overall health, appearance, and manageability of my hair. It's the first natural hair product that I've ever tried and it is now my staple conditioner. It's about 5 times more expensive than my normal conditioner, but it is well worth the price!Update: Make sure you rinse this out thoroughly! While I still love this conditioner, I've noticed that, unlike lighter conditioners, if you don't take the time to rinse this out thoroughly, you will be left with some yucky-feeling greasy areas in your hair. I've found that the best way to get all of it out is to apply an instant conditioner (which is thinner in consistency) to your hair after rinsing White Camellia out, and then rinse that out. The residue from the White Camellia will rinse out with the instant conditioner. that is all. I used to love this formula and did not need a lot of product to get the slip/condition I needed. However this recent purchase was a disappointment. I found the ginger vanilla fragrance overwhelming and nauseating. I need a lot of product for a small section of hair. With the size and fragrance to consider, it’s just not worth it.",4,2,2

Disappointing and not worth the $$. Do not recommend It’s ok Product seems heavier than when I’d bought it in the past. Not sure if the formulation has changed or what. I bought this after several months into the pandemic, when I couldn't get a haircut and my hair was approaching shoulder-length! It worked great. Now that I'm back to my military-style cut, I find that I still love this spray. Will continue to buy it. I see that some people claim that this company sells a ""knock off"". Based on the photos of the authentic and original, I definitely received the proper product in my order. Still, I will be cautious in ordering the next bottle -- hoping it will be the same authentic one I previously received. Bumble and Bumble does not provide comprehensive labeling of ingredients.  If one has sensitivities, one needs to know.  And law prescribes complete listing on cosmetic products.  Here's what the label on the bottle actually says:  Water, Magnesium Sulfate, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract, Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract, Isocetheth-20, Citric Acid, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Linalool, Limonene, Hexyl  Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Fragrance <ILN33889>This is pretty dramatically different from the benign and natural list they provide, even on the Bumble and Bumble website.There are online reports of skin sensitivity to this, and while I cannot be certain about the causal connection, about the time I began using it, I began to have problems with dermatitis, beginning on my neck.  Now I wrap a towel around my neck before spraying, yet I am still using this product because I like the body and lasting curl it gives my limp thin hair. Expensive but worth it. I have hair with natural spiral curls by the neck that fade into frizzy wave on the top layers. It's long and last 8 inches are very damaged (bleached from my natural level 2/3 brown to platinum and then back to a level 5 brown). With diffuser and product, I could get the frizzy top to kind of curl but that curl would just fade into long stringy straight ends that couldn't hold any shape. I got this product AND changed my shampoo regiment. I started putting cinditioner on the ends of my hair before shampoo to protect those dry ends in the shower. After washing, I let hair air dry to about 50%, then use light mist of Surf Spray up top and diffuse. Last thing I do is spray Surf Spray on those dry ends of mine and immediately diffuse the ends to dry the spray. They curl up and hold all day!Some reviews say the spray is crunchy. I find that, if you spray at a distance from the hair, you get an even distribution and no crunchy or stickiness. I recommend, big time! arrived on time and works well. A stylist recommended I try this product and I really enjoy it. I have straight hair with a few cowlicks, so I keep my hair slightly longer on top than most. 3-4 sprays after a shower and running my hands through/twisting chunks of hair to work in the product. Then I style it as usual. I can see a noticeable difference in volume/body and it provides some hold. It allows my hair to feel soft as if there is no product in it but still manageable. There are still flyaways, so I will occasionally add a small amount of clay product once it dries if I am going somewhere fancy.I have been using this product frequently for three months and still have more to use!I also purchased the travel size and both work well.",3,2,1

It's easy to hold and the atomizer tip lets out a gentle, light spray that isn't over the top or messy. The plastic is soft but not like a cheap plastic. It'll live through being dropped a few times trust me. I've had mine for a couple years now and I use it for my plants. It's my favorite spray bottle to use. The color isn't too dark so you can see the water level when it's being filled and it's easy to clean. The trigger has the same pull as it did when I first bought it and doesn't leak when being used. We've all had those junky spray bottles that leak and it's beyond annoying. This one, so far, hasn't done any of that. It's a well made bottle. You won't be disappointed. I used these for small cleaning bottles and my husband has one that he uses when grilling.  They're sturdy, don't leak and it's easy to adjust the spay up and down. Very good control of how fine or concentrated the mist is. I used it to mist my plants and to keep my acrylic paint from drying out It always spills on me i like this. the price was low. the components are durable and functional. its exactly as it is advertised as, good for hair, spraying plants, or similar things. it holds about 8 ounces of water. Review is for the little green spray bottle.So I was needing a nice water bottle for my hair and it works perfectly well for this. Gives a nice, wide spray for wetting hair…but this is not where I really was impressed. I needed to clean the bathroom with a bleach mist and the previous bottle I had was no longer working. It’s crazy hard to find a sprayer that can withstand diluted bleach mixtures, even after thoroughly rinsing it out. Anyhow…I grabbed this thinking I would just buy another knowing it was only a few bucks and didn’t anticipate it holding up after one use. I used it for the shower that day and it came out better than normal, I think it was because of the nice wide spray application. The kicker is…a few weeks later and the spray mechanism still worked! It’s a very durable little bottle even for chemicals. The only downside is it’s on the small side, but it works out ok because I rinse clean water through it after using bleach to try to lessen the chance of ruining the spray mechanism. Purchasing more now. Great little squirt bottle to use, small and does not take up much space. Easy to use and would be great for kids as well",1,5,-4

It does have an awesome shine though.It could be because this is formulated for Caucasian hair and I'm Asian so I still give it 4 stars. :)Or maybe because I'm using another shampoo I haven't finished using yet so the effect isn't as good as it's supposed to be.Either way, I'm allergic to many other shampoo brands so I'd still stick to using this.For volume I can always use a hairdryer!

If the company could reassure me it doesn't, I'll keep buying the products because I do love everything I've bought so far. I got this and the matching shampoo and I am not too impressed. My hair is a bit too soft and weightless. Its hard t style without texture. I like both the shampoo and the conditioner but for some reason they have vanished from the store shelves.  I am sorry this happened.  I have very fine, thin hair and this shampoo and condition was good for me.  Did not weigh my hair down and left it soft and shinny. The product works well as a conditioner,  but I haven't noticed a shine. I am not sure how this product works on its own because I use the shampoo and conditioner.

I have tried all different kinds of products to help my gray hair shine.  The oils are too oily and flatten my hair and spray net holds the style but doesn't make hair shine.  This product is amazing in that it gives your hair a beautiful shine that looks very natural with no oily flattening.  Hair stays full and fluffy - but shiny! Hair Its fabulous on your hair. Keeps your hair healthy, shiny and smells amazing. Small dab in your hair, blow dry or not and ready to go I've tried many products to achieve control and shine. This one is far and away the best. This product makes my hair feel like silk. A little goes a long way. Extremely happy with this except for the fragrance, though it fades quickly. It's great for wet hair and then blow dry or letting hair dry naturally. It also works well on dry hair if your natural hair is not too oily.For reference I'm working with curly mixed hair with a 3 or C curl that is somewhat frizzy and dry when not properly tended. I think this will be fine for anyone with thick or fine, dry and/or curly hair that doesn't want an oily greasy mess. I can use this and it seems like no product has been used at all.

Recommend their products to anyone who wants to maintain their healthy hair at home - during your self love time! This is my 2nd Conair Bonnet dryer. I love the convenience of the popup and the size for storing. It slides under the bookshelf and does not take up floor space. The only issue I have is the bonnet is too short, so it takes longer for the sides of my hair to dry. I resolved that issue by draping a towel over the sides to hold the heat. Quality is not the best but for the money is what you get. Been using it every other sunday the get a rest from the hair blower and it works perfectly.

I wait until it cools out completely to storage it back to the original box. This item was purchased for my 92 year old mother that still prefers rollers in her hair!  Style, ease, and comfort was superb.  Packs away neatly when not in use .  Very portable to take to different locations.  Mom loves it! It took me a while to set it up to use. Dries Quick ! Nice for home use.  I have long curly hair and appreciate the diffusing effect.The high speed does get a bit warm, even with the vent at the top open all of the way.  Low speed seems to work well without getting too hot.  I would give this five stars if it had a temperature adjustment to go along with the fan adjustment.  It is loud, as expected, and if I was using everyday, I might wear earplugs.It is a bit hard to adjust the height, and it seems that there is a lot of confusion on how to do this.  I hope the picts I have added help that. You have to hold the base down with one hand, and really pull up hard with the other hand to raise the lower end of the base.  It does have 1"" increments so there is about 4-5"" that you can adjust.Overall, I am happy with my purchase as a nice alternative to my hand-held diffuser.  It is nice to sit and let the dryer do the work verses my hand and arm doing the work. My wife likes it",1,5,-4

Although I really love their Moisture Milks line, this one is a great light conditioner that I've used in conjunction with its sister shampoo.I was initially worried that because this fragrance is a clarifying product, my hair would be left feeling stripped.  However my worries were for nothing - the conditioner used after a coconut oil pre-poo & shampoo with the VO5 Kiwi Lime, left my hair feeling soft & clean (but not that awful squeeky clean feeling).  I haven't used the condish solely for a co-wash but plan to try it during the summer.I also want to comment on the price gouging of this product - I hope that those who'd really like to try it can find it on the ground because $5+ for a bottle that one can find for less than $1 is RIDICULOUS & unfair.  This product can also be bought on-line from Dollar Tree (buy a case for $6!!), Rite-Aid & CVS.",4,5,-1

You can use it as both a rod and a clamp curling iron.Pros: Temperature Control, swivel cord, marcel clamp, rotating handle on clamp so you can easily ""roll"" it in the palm of your hand, various sizes (I use both a 1"" and 1.25"")Cons: Temperature control and/or swivel cord seem to last only 2-3 years before they start to malfunction and I have to replace.Tip to avoid accidentally singeing your hair: before placing hot curling iron to hair for first curl of the day, take a damp (absolutely all water rung out, no drips) face towel and wrap it around the barrel, underneath and above clamp of the hot curling iron ""wiping off"" the hot part. It will sizzle like it is frying at first. It brings the iron down just enough, then use on hair immediately (before barrel can get sizzling hot again). Thank goodness that isn't your hair, right?  Alternatively, I first turn on the curling iron to heat up to a very low temperature. The moment  I'm ready to start using on my hair, I turn it up to my normal setting.(Example: for my baby-fine hair,  330 degrees to heat up. Turn it up to 380 when I pick it up to use on my hair. When it is 380, I am only allowing each section of hair to have DIRECT contact to the hot barrel LESS than 5 seconds. I still like to use the damp towel method on the curling iron before I touch it to my hair as a precaution, touching the towel to the barrel until the sizzling subsides.) I javelin done hair 20 plus years and have used hot tools the whole with little issues. For some reason the heat element went out about 4 1/2 months later and my return time frame was closed through Amazon so I contacted the seller (HOT TOOLS) with the number provided in my order and the woman I spoke to was super awesome and is replacing my iron. 4 stars due to them normally being a great tool and excellent seller customer service. This is a great product!  I love my hot tool curling iron!  The best part is the cord doesn’t tangle or curl up!You won’t be sorry, my hairdresser recommended it and I am so happy she did. Good replacement for wife's hair curler I love this curling iron! I like this size to give me curly ringlets. This is a brand I’ve trusted for years. It gets hot & stays hot. It is durable & will last for yrs. This iron is the same iron salons use so it may take some time to get use to but easy to master. Beautiful curls! Ergonomic spin.  Feels great and easy to use. I purchased two of these off of Amazon at the same time — same seller, same listing. I purchased the 1” and the 3/4”. One was clearly a returned item that was poorly repacked, the other was a brand new item in a very damaged box.The 1” was overnight prime and arrived on time. The box was in pristine shape. However, as soon as I opened the box, the marcel iron itself came sliding out of the box. It was not packed in the interior plastic bag, and the cord was not twist-tied together. The cord was wrapped around the base of the wand very tightly. The curling wand was smudged and dirty, as if someone had tried to use it with hair product and didn’t clean it before turning it. The manufacturer instructions paper was missing from the box. It’s pretty clear that this was a return product from someone being re-sold as new. However, the marcel iron did power up properly and, after disinfecting it twice, I was able to use it. It does appear to hear up to the correct temps.The 3/4” arrived the next day, standard prime. The exterior box had a corner completely smashed and torn open. However, the marcel iron inside the exterior box was inside its appropriate plastic packaging. The manufacturer instructions were inside the box. The power cord was still twist-tied in its factory packaging and it was clear it was a new iron — not a return. The device powered up appropriately and the temperature settings were correct.These do appear to be actual Hot Tools products, and I do believe these products work. However, I would consider buying from your local professional shop or from the Hot Tools website to ensure you do indeed get a *new* and *unused* product. Useful",5,4,1

absorbed love toweland best thing pink,"Diva Darling, Easy To Use & Super Absorbent Microfiber Hair Towel, Pink (19 x 39-Inches)","I have long hair (mid-back length) and this product is more efficient at drying it while in a ""turban"" than doing the same with a regular towel. I find that the best way to use it involves: 1. Putting my hair in a turban with a regular towel first for a few minutes (5-10) to soak up the initial wetness. 2. THEN put this product on and it dries the remainder quicker than the towel. 3. After I take it off, I use it like a regular towel to dry my hair (squeezing instead of rubbing). This last step could be done with a regularly shaped microfiber cloth/towel too; however I don't have one so I use this product as one and it works. It’s cute. Kind of soft. I just felt like it didn’t want to absorb most of the waterFrom my hair. It’s also kind of small. if you have long hair or larger sized head, not for you. Exactly what I needed. It took me a few tries to figure out how to actually put it on. It is a little confusing at first, but once I figured it out it was perfect. I have long thick hair and was afraid it would be too small, but it seems to fit all of it just fine. It stays on pretty well, and it doesn't dry it super thick but it definitely helps it dry faster than just letting my hair air dry. Great product overall, I really needed something like this and I love it. I've ordered hair turbines like this before, from other companies.  And while they work well, as my hair is getting longer, the lack of elastic around the edges allows the abundance of hair to creep out.  Not with this one.  This one is just as nice as the one I bought from Bed, Bath & Beyond.  I would definitely recommend this product to any lady out there, but especially those with coarse &/or curly hair, damaged hair, etc. I love these turbans!  Helps to dry my hair a bit quicker, but what I love the most is that they are lightweight & secure...I don't feel like I'm having to balance my head all the time like a do when wearing a regular towel.  I know some other reviews complained that it was too small & too hard to put on, but I don't find it to be so.  With the elastic banding I think that is plenty big - and I have a large-sized head and lots of hair.  I've found that it's easy to put on if I:1.  flip my head & hair over upside down2.  put the button on the back side against the nape of my neck3.  get all my hair tucked inside4.  twist the whole thing, starting at the end of my hair5.  pull the twist back over my head & clip the elastic over the button. Someone gave me this towel maybe fifteen years ago, and I never usedit much until recently. I have long hair and a small head and it worksgreat for me. Easy on the hair, light on the head, and yes it does pull more waterout of the hair (not necessarily from twisting but a light patting down beforeI lightly twist it up on my head). No need to tightly twist to secure it. Yes, the buttondid fall off and I had to reattach it. But I can honestly say it is worth the hassle to redo the button.  I take this towel wherever I travel...almost everywhere. Great in coldclimates. It did take a few tries to figure out that you want to pull the largest end overthe top of the head (easiest when leaning forward and letting hair hang in front of you)so that the button ends up at the back of your head.All in all...the most useful hair towel product for long hair I've ever found. I'm going tobuy some for my neices. The only issue I’ve had is trying to get the loop to stay over the button. And once I have succeeded it is lopsided on my head 😂 A little too short for longer hair. The elastic doesn't stretch long enough for hair below the shoulders",1,4,-3

It comes from my mother's side - same type of hair my sister has and my sister straightens her hair everyday.  I've used conditioner, leave-in condition, etc but to be honest, I don't want to use styling products -- she's only 4.After showering, her hair drips all over the place.  She doesn't like hair dryers, as they're ""too noisy in my ear and my ears feel so hot!""I grabbed this due to the price.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that she may or may not like, and something that we won't use.She loves it.  She sits still and quietly as I'm gently brushing/drying her hair.  She asks that I dry her hair ""slowly"" and to ""take my time"" so that it looks nice.  I don't have to worry about it getting too hot.  It also makes her hair look shiny and soft.  Someone had asked if she had a salon style her hair recently - which is great because I just do the cut at home.Overall, a great tool to get your feet wet.  If you're a collector of hair products type person, not sure if this is the right tool.  It didn't really ""dry"" her hair quickly, it's take a bit from wet to dry even with thin hair.  I'm sure it will curl with product.One thing that I noticed in critical reviews, some mentioned the locking feature.  When I first got it, the lock wouldn't turn and the brush would just fall out.  I was immediately thinking, this is what they're talking about!!  I realized that I didn't push the brush all the way in (so even when you think it's in because you feel that ""give"", keep pushing), and when you're locking it, you have to take care to just turn the lock rather than the whole thing. I bought another this year. February, then October. The one in February  heating element went out. Then it's useless. Purchased another in October.  I hope this one last longer. Overall, the dryer is decent. The blower and heater are a little weak. I really like this hair tool, but it has some things you should know.  It's best to use this on dry hair.  The power of the hot air that blows through it is not enough to dry hair from wet, unless you have a LOT of time on your hands.  Best to blow dry your hair or air dry it first.  If you have thin hair, not an issue.  If you have really thick hair like me, the lack of power to the air blowing through is a bit off putting, but not a deal breaker.First, this hair tool is $19.99 so for that price it's a great deal for what it does.  I would expect more if I paid $40 and upwards, but for a bargain hot air curler, I'm not disappointed.I LOVED this when I had shorter hair - about stacked bob length and a bit longer.  Now that my thick hair is longer than chin length, I needed a bit more 'oomph' and gave it to my mom who has thin short hair (she loves it!).  This tool worked extremely well on curling under the stacked bob back of my hair and giving me some lift on top.  When my hair got longer and weighted down, not so much anymore.This tool is great for giving a slight curl to the ends of hair and the bangs or short back.  Now that I'm growing my hair back out I had to move full time to a blow dryer and round brush or paddle brush.  Again - phenomenal for shorter hair, not so much for heavier medium length hair.  It really all depends on your hair thickness and length.  I would definitely purchase again if I were to cut my hair short again. Bought this to replaced my old one, it lasted for more than 2 yrs. Can’t expect this to last for long with this price. I ordered this one after my last order (another brand) proved to be too hot for my hair. The heat and dual settings are perfect for my short, fine hair. The description of the product on this page, after all, does specify that it is for fine hair.  It’s not excessively hot (my previous problem) and blows air in a somewhat gentle manner. The bristles are far enough apart that my hair doesn’t get tangled.  But if you have long, thick hair, you may want to consider another brush. It’s perfect for me. My problem—which is solely my issue—is with the size of the two rollers. They are too big for my hair, but I decided to take a chance because 3/4” brushes are difficult to find. It’s easy to use.  Does the job, They don't make them like they used to! We have a hair dryer that we have had at least twenty years that still works. I have been using the Conair brand of curling brush for many years because of the 2 inch brush, but I do not like the fact that it stops working at about the 12-month point.  My husband says they are probably made this way intentionally. I need to try another brand to see if it will last longer.",1,2,-1

I have very fine/thin hair and it makes it very smooth and easy to brush.I only use it about once a week and I am loving it so far. Smells amazing and the smell lasts a while.Highly recommend ! I love how this product makes my hair feel. I have been using top of the line deep conditioners, wasting a fortune, and this low cost deep conditioner has topped them all. I use it diligently once a week, leaving it in for about 45 minutes to an hour under heat. When I rinse it off my hair is like silk. I am Latina with frizzy curly hair, and since using this product, combined with the leave- in my blowing drying time has decreased. My hair is left looking shiny, silky, bouncy and absolutely beautiful. I am so glad I brought this product. It will remain as part of my hair care regimen for life!!!! I have very think, very coarse & wavy hair. Having been someone who has changed my hair color practically monthly for nearly 30 years, my curiosity got the best of me with this product. I am so glad it did! This product has been the single most helpful tool to help get my hair back in the best condition as well as completely change the texture of it. When people ask me what I use now, I am happy to direct them to the product and site. After reading several reviews, it definitely seems to work best for coarse, curly, and certain types of ethnic hair. While I am caucasian,I have difficulties often found with certain ethnic hair types. I am sincerely glad that I have stumbled on this product. I have never been happier with my hair!

It's a strengthening treatment , I was a bit on the fence when I washed it off because it had not really softened my hair, but I was very pleased at how voluminous and pliable my hair was after I untwisted the next day.

Stronger and thicker I first tried it around 10 years ago and have used this continuously for the past 2 years. My hair loves it and I only experience issues with breakage and shedding when I have NOT used it. I have used it when I wore relaxers in the past and I use it now with natural (chemical free) hair (4 years). I like the scent, in blends well, moisturizes, and I have used it on both wet and dry hair.** I have seen these descriptions added to help others to determine if this will work for them:  My hair is 3c  in the crown area, 4a in the mid-section, and 3c for the rest. My hair is mid-back, past collar bone.** This stuff leaves my hair so soft and comb-able. My hair tangles when you so much as look at it, and this is the only thing that lets me put a comb easily through my hair. Prior to this I would never (and I mean NEVER) dare to put a denman brush through my hair while it was wet. With this I was able to easily use a denman brush on my hair (with the conditioner still in, but a little water added to it & right before I fully rinsed it out). I am amazed. My hair is 4a, and super dry. I relaxed my hair again about 3 years ago after being natural for years. I'd gotten sick of detangling once my big chop grew out I wish I knew about this stuff before I gave in and relaxed it. It had grown about mid back but it was damaged badly from over processing so I had 6 inches cut off in February of 2019. Now it is just below shoulder level, I've had 2 more cuts since as there is snot another 2 inches that needs to go, but I want to keep my hair about shoulder length so we're trimming it a bit at a time. I use my regular shampoo and conditioner first then I do the Silicon Mix. If I have time I sit under the dryer with it in, but if not I just put it in for 3-5 minutes while I finish showering.TLDR: I love this stuff. It does have a heavy scent, but it's one that I happen to like so it doesn't bother me. I use it on my 9 year old since he is a swimmer and his hair is super dry too. He's not wild about the smell, but once it dries it doesn't bother him. Delivery was ok, but when I open the box I get the surprise that the bottle was damage and it was completely empty. Utilice este producto para mi cabello. Lo dejo hidratado y bello I have been doing my hair for years. I have never found anything Soo wonderful for dry hair until I found this brand. I found the conditioner first. Fell in love with it so I decided to try this. It is pretty much the same smell as the conditioner but the consistency is not as thick. I use the conditioner when I wash my hair and when my hair is almost dry I use this and comb it thru. It keeps my hair feeling soft and smooth and that is amazing for my hair. Let's put it this way, I was almost ready to try a professional product that was too expensive. I tried this as a last resort. I have no reason to try the expensive stuff now because this is perfect! I would not use the conditioner if your hair tends to be on the oily side. I would however use this! I love this product, been using it since I was 15 and I am 27 now. I love that they still sell it here since I can't find it where I live. Makes my hair so smooth and I use it daily for my military bun.

They lasted my family a long time compared to other bottles. Made our hair so soft and smells great! Excelent I bought this for my daughers, ages 13 & 11. The oldest tends to have dry hair. This conditioner is not any more conditioning than any other conditioner. It smells good, does not weigh hair down, but also is not super conditioning. It does detangle well and leave hair soft, but if you need something more restorative or reparative I would buy something else. The original formula for this conditioner is awesome!  I used to get horrible tangles, but when I began using this conditioner they disappeared.  You do have to use a good amount, though (the ""quarter sized"" amount only seems to work with salon brands).  It also has a wonderful powder smell, soft and clean.The new formula still works well, but smells like some ingredient in it has gone bad.  Based on the pic this is the original formula.  Stock up on this while you can. I have very curly and coily hair. I usually have luck with conditioners and have been using Aussie Moist for about a year and wanted to try a change. Learned not to fix what isn't broken!This particular conditioner did absolutely nothing for my hair but make it smell good. I used it for about 15 minutes under a cap, no heat, and rinsed my hair with cool water, as usual. My very coily hair did not bend an inch! I was so very surprised! Water alone curls my hair but I had never experienced any conditioner to leave my curls looking so tacky and undefined. I think the conditioner actually uncurled my hair. It also did not feel too moisturized. I did not use the conditioner as a detangler so I cannot comment on slip, but the consistency is very thick (which I like for detangling) and the product smells nice. I am returning to Walmart and will not repurchase. (BTW, the shampoo version works wonders and is a staple for my hair! Odd huh?) Whyyyyyyyy do companies change their products and ruin a good thing?!!!!  I was in LOOOOOOOVE with the scent of the old Dove Daily Moisture Therapy Conditioner!!!!

What is my hair demographic? I'm an African American with 4b all-natural hair that's completely ""virgin"" to heat. No perm, no texturizer, nothing but a super awesome afro.That said, this will straighten your hair! But not the way it looks on the picture. It is a nice result, and my hair feels pretty soft afterward too. However, its still a bit bushy. This is fine by me, 'cause I did not want actually want pin straight hair (I like my afro!). If I wanted pin straight hair, I'd go get a weave, lol. But as a warning to those who DO expect pin straight hair from this flat iron: the hair will begin to revert at the tips almost minutes after doing it, so it won't be straight like on the picture unless you heat train your hair. I'm going to try blow drying my hair straighter next time and see if I get better results.The worst part about this flat iron, I think, is that the steam reservoir runs out VERY quickly. I found a way to make it last longer by turning off the steam if the flat iron is not in my hair, but the water will still go down even if the steam isn't on (it just goes down slower).The best part is that my hair feels soft and still healthy. But I'm also using as much heat protecting products as possible, so that could be it. However, my hair does seem to like the steam (I tried it with the steam off and my hair refused to straighten...). It seems to be, overall, a normal flat iron.So I think its a nice investment as long as you know what you're getting when you get it!UPDATE 01/11/12: Actually, I felt I should edit this review because I found out something interesting - the tips of my hair were frizzy because I was doing it wrong, lol. After using the comb-chase method and trimming my ends a bit, it straightens natural, kinky Afro hair just fine! And the steam leaves my hair feeling very soft. I definitely would recommend this to a friend. Updated to 4 stars! I was so excited to get this straightener home...this was the most I have spent on any hair product, ever (I know, I know, I am cheap/poor), and I couldn't wait to see what a steam straightener could do to my head full of unruly hair.I have that strange, in-between hair that isn't really wavy, but it's definitely not straight.  If I were to wash it and let it air-dry, it would look like a fascinating study in indecisiveness.  Some of it would be slightly curly, some of it would curl under, some of it would curl over, and most of it would just look like I hadn't brushed it in years.  I am NOT that girl who can just wash and go, but I'm also not the girl who can be bothered to spend more than 10-15 minutes doing anything about it.  (I should probably just shave my head.)I've been using either hair products (shampoo, serum) that contain keratin (Tresemme, Suave) or Moroccan oil (Suave) since I purchased it, and it is doing wonders with my almost shoulder-length hair.  I have layers cut in that I am currently trying to grow out, but I can honestly blow-dry my hair, run this straightener through it in less than 6 minutes, and be supremely happy with how it looks!  It is straighter than I've ever seen it before with any previous $20-$40 hair straighteners, and it's not getting fried or breaking off.My only complaint is that my steam function isn't always working, even though I leave it turned on.  It's very easy to tell when it's working, simply from the sights and sounds of using it (duh), but also because the water in the removable reservoir disappears a million times faster.  It's probably just something I'm doing wrong, honestly...but otherwise, couldn't be happier with this purchase! I have long, thick, wavy/semi-curly hair that has always been unruly. My hair was great in the 80s, when perms and big hair were in. But, my hair is not very cooperative with the smooth, straight hairstyles. I have tried various hair products, straightening irons, curling irons, dryers, etc. But, no matter how much time and effort I put into my hair, it typically ends up wavy and frizzy within a matter of hours. I thought long and hard before making this purchase and carefully reviewed all of the reviewers' comments here, as well as elsewhere on the internet. I've used a CHI and had some luck, but the results were not nearly as good as the Conair straightener here. I actually have another Infiniti by Conair straightener that I have been using for about 2 years, but it is not the Nano Silver and it does not have the steam feature. My older model works okay, but, again, not nearly as well as this one here. First, the Nano Silver technology really provides fast, smooth, silky results. My hair felt like silk after using the straightener. Second, the steam feature is perfect for people with naturally wavy or curly hair because it really helps to straighten fast. Think of a clothes iron -- when you use the steam feature, your wrinkles come out quick vs no steam. The steam feature is also great if you have slept on your hair -- fast touch up! Finally, and most importantly, the results last! My hair stays straight all day and, unlike any other product, it even stays relatively straight and smooth after sleeping on it.As for the use of distilled water -- if you do not have very hard water where you live, tap water will work fine. All of the impurities have been removed from distilled water, so there is no mineral build-up in your iron if you use distilled water. It is a pain to fill, but I just stick it under the tap.",1,3,-2

This one seems to dry a little faster than my last one and is a little more lightweight. I am disappointed that the hottest setting isn’t that hot but it is better for hair health to not be super hot in general. Overall, I’m happy with it so far. Just hope it lasts as long as my other one. I am giving this dryer five stars because it does what it says it will.  So many products don't, so this is a relief.  After reading all of the reviews, I expected two key things.  One, that the dryer would malfunction in some way (flames flying out of it, wires in the cord breaking, etc) and two, that my hair would be dry in no time at all.  So far, so good on the malfunction issue. I'm not living in fear of my dryer.  To help the cord life, I attached a larger loop to the dryer so I could safely hang it on a hook (the loop hole on the dryer was too small for my hook).  As far as my hair drying at warp speed, the jury is still out.  My husband mentioned that he thinks he can dry our daughter's hair faster, so maybe it does.  Personally, I don't see much difference in dry time from this expensive one to my BJ's cheapo purchase a few years ago.  It's not a significant enough difference to justify the cost.I'm keeping this dryer for two reasons.  First, it's hard to find the speed and heat combinations that this one has.  I can use a warm/hot setting for my kids that won't burn their delicate skin (2 and 4 years old) and a hot/hot setting for me to dry my medium length, thick hair as fast as I can.  In either case, I can use a ""low blow"" setting or a ""high blow"" setting (such technical terms I have) so I can not only control the speed at which I dry, but also the level of noise output.  That brings me to my second reason for keeping it.  LOW NOISE LEVEL.  The is the quietest dryer I've ever owned and the key reason I'm keeping it.  I can finally dry my hair before I go to bed at night, without fear of waking the entire household. And if I use the ""low blow"" setting on hot heat, I can get my hair totally dry with very little noise.  For me, that's worth the cost!Mine came in black, which is what I ordered.  I got two filters for the back of it (I don't know why though) and the nozzle that concentrates the heat to one area.  I don't use that, but I found that my old diffuser fits over this dryer and I use that quite often.  I would say my hair dries much faster with the diffuser over the top.Some reviewers said the dryer is too heavy.  I'm 5'1"" and I don't work out (unless running after my kids counts), so I was concerned about this fact.  I dry my hair pretty much daily, so weight isn't a small concern over time.  But, it's not a problem.  In fact, it's slightly lighter than my last dryer, so I'm happy!Overall, I would recommend this dryer to others and I would purchase it again in the future. I love this blow dryer; the only improvement could be a slightly longer cord. It's a tad short for professional use but I'm figuring it out because it delivers such an amazing blowout! My lite one died after 4/5 long hard working salon years and they don’t make it anymore. I decided to give this or a try and I’m obsessed with it. It’s slightly heavier than my sedu lite one but lighter than the other back one. Small and compacted. It’s as had more power than the lite one. This blow dryer has lasted me more years than my 2 twin turbos I previously had. I have significant heat damage all over the entire outer layer of my hair. I have tried all kinds of expensive hair products claiming to fix this problem, but all they did was add a layer of waxy-feeling build-up that's hard to wash out over time. My stylist initially suggested a high-end dryer called Salano, but then he recommended Elchim more mostly because of Amazon's sale price that put them both in the same comparison category. While nothing is going to fix all the damage I have (other than waiting for it all to grow out), this dryer will definitely eliminate me doing more damage to the newer roots. It gets a little heavy, mostly because it takes me almost 15 minutes to dry my hair. The key is to dry VERY small sections at a time from the bottom up with a good round styling brush. This definitely takes longer, but I get a much smoother result. That's taken some practice because I'm usually in a hurry, and I always tried to dry bigger chunks to expedite the process. My husband thought I was crazy for spending the money, but women have to do what we have to do, right?I like that this dryer is made in Italy and it's professional-grade. The quality is evident primarily in the power of the air flow. One slight annoyance: when holding the dryer during use, my palm frequently tends to go over the black temperature button and flip it up one setting. Also, the buttons are not marked for temp or air flow so it took a little while to remember which was which. I would have thought the red button would indicate heat.I now believe in the ion dryers versus my Target Revlon enemy that fried my hair with plain dry heat. Watch for sale prices and free shipping offers and invest in this product if you're looking for a semi-solution to a problem like mine. Many people have said this dryer has lasted over 10 years - I usually burned up the Revlons after 2. I hope to get the expected value for my money over time. I REALLY wanted to like this upscale blow dryer. It was a “treat” for myself. I just don’t understand all the five star accolades for this average blow dryer. It’s quite heavy, the switches are in an awkward place and just holding the handle turns them on and off randomly, the power cord is so thick that it is inflexible and kind of inhibits easy movement. The handle also has a seam where the blow dryer is put together in two parts. On mine anyway, when I gripped the handle it flexed like it was loose.My biggest complaint: it does not have the strong air velocity that I want/need or heat that I would expect. My Rusk w8less is superior in every way. I’ve had it over six years and never a problem… Still works like new.In my opinion, it is nothing more than average with a super high price. I just couldn’t  justify the cost for the value,  so I returned it. The last elchim I bought lasted me for almost five years , hands down I love them,they are powerful and lightweight. I’m a hairdresser and use it every day for hours , the only one I’ve seen stand the test of time!",5,4,1

This product is amazing and is becoming harder to find. So I was very happy to find it on amazon. However, this product came in the very same bag/pouch that is in the photo, it was not boxed as it should have been. Both items smell stale and old, and of course one of the item looked as if it was removed from someone's bathroom closet. This was not cool at all. I was very disappointed. I put in for a refund and I am hoping that I will get it. I will not be putting this product in my hair. So sad that anyone would ship an product in this package and stand by it. It made my hair soft, I can't call it a carrot cream since any carrot in it is way almost to the bottom, it's not that natural as I thought it would be. I'm trying to stay with natural or semi natural products. However I really love this product it keep hair moist and soft for a long time all you need is just a drop and it keep the hair moisturize I got this as a non-water-based moisturizer for my dry afro hair for when I'm trying to avoid water-based products that frizz up some of my hair styles. I can't comment on it's ""fertilizing action"" except to say that it feels a little tingly and minty on the scalp probably thanks to the menthol. Whilst I sincerely doubt that's growing my hair any, I still make sure I massage some into my scalp. It has a... ""unique"" smell that fades after some time thankfully. I feel like this makes my hair a little stronger and less prone to breakage. This was my 2nd time purchasing this and whilst I'm not totally blown away by this, it will do. Nothing to dislike I have been using this product for years, that should tell the story! If you have dry, curly, corse and thick hair, this item is for you.  Wash, condition your hair and while still wet, apply this carrot oil while hair is still wet and your hair will dry with a healthy and smooth look.  No greasy feeling, no stiff hair.... just beautiful shiny healthy hair.  I love it. Product was reasonably priced and shipped fast. i have been using this product for years and i find it keeps my dry hair moist enough throughout the whole day. the cream is a little thick but i find if you only use a small amount it isnt that bad I use this product daily on my hair and body.  My hair is soft and shiny when using this product. I have a problem with dry skin on my legs and arms.  A little of this goes a long way.  Makes your skin so smooth and shiny, you could do a commercial.",5,2,3

Never sticky, dull or hard. Love this product. Jane Carter Solutions Wrap and Roll is great for just about anything where one wants hair to comply. I know it’s marketed for roller sets - I’ve used it for twists, braids, slicked back styles, curly fros etc. Too bad it doesn’t come in a larger size! When it arrived it was leaking so I didn't have almost the full amount which I don't know who fault it is the sender or carrier? It was a mess of the liquid from the package but cleaned it off. It smelt so dang good though. I used it that night to test it with my other order: Curl former.(Followed the instructions from Youtuber) I was amazed by the results. It was super soft to the look and touch! Made my entire head smell so dang good and just right bounce, volume and shine. (I know they say don't use the product if it have been broken,leaking,seal missing or w.e but I couldn't wait to complain to sender to send me a new one so I was like challenge accepted and tried it anyways but you don't have to do that and it's up to you if you receive your product damaged). I would have gave it full 5 stars but because I received mines damaged I gave it 4 and I think that's right considered that the product it self worked. I don't base the rating all on how soon or late it arrived or if product is intact or damaged like other reviewers. This product is amazing and I'm looking into trying more of the Jane Carter line. Love this product for years. I have thick, high porosity 4a/4b hair that is very frizz prone. I used this product alone for a flexirod set and the results were bomb (in a cold, dry climate). I was able to detangle my hair with the product in and comb through it and it really helped to smooth my strands around the rod. It has the hold of a cream styler with the lightness of a foam/mousse. My results were super defined and moisturized without massive amounts of crunch and I was able to get a good 3 days out of the style before it got snowed on. The Jane Carter Wrap & Roll Mousse has become one of my go to styling products. I purchased it in September on a whim and have been using it consistently ever since. The mousse arrived perfectly and even sooner than intended. After washing my hair, I apply the mousse in sections for styling twists and roller sets. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I do notice some white flakes after the product dries. You can check out how I use the product in my hair on my channel. Youtube / Apolonia Pearl So far I really like this product. It provided great slip when rolling my hair with magnetic rollers. It left my hair very soft and bouncy, even after several days post using it. It has a nice floral scent that leaves the hair smelling really nice after it dries. There are no flakes or crunchy cast left on my hair after use which is another plus.",1,2,-1

Going from a dark red to a platinum blonde is as extreme as one can get on their hair and this conditioner has done a great job at restoring my hair and saving it from being a frizzy, over-processed nightmare.Other products by this company haven't impressed me, but this particular conditioner/repair surprised me in a good way. The only other product that I've had work as well on my hair is a protein treatment that is messy, smells bad, and requires ten minutes under a hot dryer to activate. I've never found a leave-in conditioner that has done anything near as well as this wash-out product.This smells nice - fruity but not too strong, doesn't require heat, and is thick and easy to apply. About once a week I use it on dry hair and leave it in for the recommended ten minutes before rinsing out to get the full benefit of the conditioner but even 5 minutes in the shower leaves my hair feeling soft & silky.I've added this to my regular purchases and I don't need to use any after treatments to my hair now. The conditioner is so thick you have to have the bottle upside down, otherwise, it gets stuck. I thought maybe I just got a weird bottle, but this is my third time buying and it's just how it is! Otherwise great and makes my dirty blonde hair a little lighter. Mine didn’t come with the pump. I’m not it would work even if it came with the conditioner. It is so thick I have to smash on the side of the bottle to get product out of cap. I do like the smell and my hair doesn't feel like straw anymore. I really like this conditioner. It's thick and stays in your hair until you're ready to rinse.  Also, it smells like pineapple! The best part is IT COMES WITH PUMP.  I hate when these giant bottles don't come with a pump and just has the regular squeeze top. It's a big bottle, hard to grip and squeeze in the shower, especially when your hands are wet! But this conditioner came with the pump just like it shows in the picture! Much easier. Ok, this one is tough. I LOVE Tigi products and this one smells so delish! It smells like papaya, tropical yumminess. My hair was getting pretty fried though I hadn't changed my styling tools I had changed products. The senior stylist at Toni and Guy told me NOT to use Dumb Blonde because it was frying my hair. What??? I was using the leave-in conditioner, shampoo and conditioner. I paid quite a lot for all products and then the salon that recommended this to me was telling me that it was frying my hair. She said it was too much protein. I said, ""Well, I have blonde hair and I lighten it so I thought it would HELP my hair"" She said, no, that was just marketing bull. Whoa. After emailing Toni and Guy directly they said it COULD be damaging. I said that they should put a warning label on this stuff that it should only be used ONCE A MONTH OR IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR HAIR!!! :( Bad salon, bad stylists and bad products. bye bye Toni and Guy and bye bye Tigi. I've emailed with you numerous times and I'm so not happy at spending hundreds of dollars on cuts and products that are sub par. I love this product, best treatment for blonde hair.

BUT... there are drawbacks. I will list out the Pros, Cons, and packing details in the following review.I have hair that gets oily looking after a day... and I really don't want to wash it and dry it EVERY SINGLE day. I have really long hair, so it's takes a LONG time for me to wash and dry my hair. Also, I tend to have a lot of fall outs every time I wash it, so I try to avoid washing it every day. The Rene Furterer Naturia Dry Shampoo definitely allows me to get away from not washing my hair for over 2-3 days (probably even 4-5). You just need to spray it on the top of your head, on your roots... it will look kinda like white fine powder on your head, then just comb it out with your fingers/brush. You literally go from oily looking hair to looking like you just washed/dried.The drawback: you hair won't FEEL clean:HOWEVER, there is a reason why I only gave it 4 stars. Even though it doesn't LOOK oily, it FEELS heavy. Your hair definitely FEELS heavier and it's not as ""soft"" as if you just washed your hair. When you run your hand though your hair after using the dry shampoo, it feels a little ""waxy"". So it would be good to use if you are in a rush to go out, and you don't want to wash/dry your hair for a day or 2... but it definitely doesn't FEEL like you cleaned your hair (it LOOKS fine though). In fact, it feels a little gross when you start to use it on the second day. That's why I mentioned above that it last 2-3 days, but could probably last 4-5 days... That's cause you really feel the need to wash everything off your head by day 3. It LOOKS fine, but it doesn't FEEL good.The product packaging:I saw a lot of bad reviews regarding the faulty spray... but mine was completely fine. I have owned this product for 2 weeks or so, and have used it 5-6 times, and it's working completely fine.*** BOTTOM LINE ***It works. If you have oily hair and you want to get away for not washing your hair EVERY SINGLE day, this stuff works WONDERS. It only takes 30 seconds, and you have light and soft looking hair again! =) When I have to be at the office early, it isn't practical for me to wash my hair in the morning. It takes way too long for it to dry naturally, and blowing it dry is tedious and damaging for my hair. The problem is, even though I showered and shampooed the night before, my hair is limp and the crown is a little oily-looking in the morning if I don't shampoo again. That coupled with the increasing media coverage of how unhealthy it is for us to wash our hair twice a day, I decided to try these dry shampoos. After reading a lot of reviews, this Rene Furterer Naturia was my first purchase.The Naturia definitely allowed me to get up and shower without shampooing my hair. It was pretty fabulous being able to do 3 or four parts in my crown, spraying each one and then rubbing it in, and then just do a style touch-up and go. I was even able to sleep in an extra 20 minutes (Heaven!). Another bonus was that my hair definitely had more volume in the crown. Always nice. It's too early in my trials to be definitive, but it seems that there are two drawbacks to this purchase: the product didn't last very long (This could be partially due to my lack of expertise in usage!), and I did notice a few times that my crown looked lighter than the rest of my hair, even though I tried to first just brush it as directed, and eventually to rub into my scalp and also brush out. I have almost black hair naturally,and I might've been a tad heavy-handed with it, so take that with a grain of salt. After I've tried out several other brands, I'll purchase this again and reevaluate, to be fair.Bottom line: a little pricey for the amount of uses, but it truly works. Somehow I taught my hair to be washed every day and so I went for many many years. Now I have been changing my ways and that is why I decided to try various dry shampoos. It isn't good for your hair to be washed daily, hair forgets how to stay clean on its own. Before I started using dry shampoo, I was able to go 2 days with not washing. I mean, I'd wash it...go for a day, then 2nd day was rough, I had to really work on making it look somewhat decent, tie it up etc. Then I started using dry shampoo the 2nd day. Slowly I was able to go to 3 days. Now on the 2nd day I don't use anything...just style it. On the 3rd day I use this dry shampoo and usually tie it up or something, in a bun....or brade a scarf in it and tie it in a bun....I have my ways :). What I love about this shampoo is that is almost goes on clear.....at least at first. Then you have to shake it so it doesn't become powdery. And the smell is so wonderful!!!!! It doesn't choke your senses, very subtle and dissipates quickly. So far I wash my hair every 3 days and love it. Doing this dry shampoo stuff will not save you time, believe me, but it will save your hair :) won't dry it out.  I still can't go without washing it for 5 days like I have read in some reviews :) this is a very very slow process if you are used to washing your air every day. Your hair will be very cranky. While I really like the smell and the way it leaves my hair feeling, it leaves an orange/red tint, making my blonde hair pull warm and brassy, which I don’t like. I personally try to keep my hair golden and neutral-toned, but if you already have dark or warm-toned hair, this could be a great product for you. Love it so much! Love the volume and the bounce as I flip my hair  while keeping smooth texture. And nice scent, too. This is without a doubt the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  Initially found in an exclusive salon; enjoy the ease of ordering from Amazon.  Lovely scent; nice subtle color, so don't get the typical white powdery affect that makes your hair look duller.  Really effective as a styling aid (refreshing style with a hair dryer), or on its own, as a finishing product. I've tried so many dry shampoo, I prefer Rene Furterer much more for the smell and it leaves the least residue, my head doesn't itch after using it",3,4,-1

Other than that it heats up well. So my hair is extremely oily and i need a haircut desperately but this curling iron still gave me some really nice curls. My hair slides through easily and doesn’t feel like it’s getting too hot or burning like other reviews said. I have this curling iron already in a 1 inch but wanted a bigger barrel for waves. Really like this brand for the price After having experienced a very serious hair ""incident"" on a business trip with a curling iron designed only for U.S. outlets, I was forced to make a quick change.  (Side note:  ladies, be careful!!  a curling iron designed only for 110v usage used in 200v+ countries WILL burn your hair off if you use it with just the adapter and not a transformer too!!! Please don't learn this the hard way like I did!)I bought a transformer to go along with my travel adapter for my next trip and discovered that the 110v curling irons just don't work well with the transformer in place.  I don't know why, but for some reason, they just don't seem to heat up.  I considered buying a European curling iron just for use in international travel, but when I saw this one, I realized that it was a better solution.  I don't need to worry about different curling irons depending on which country I'm going to and don't need to carry around a clunky transformer that will render the tool useless anyhow.Keep in mind, you'll still need a small adapter to use this outside of the US because the plug is intended for American outlets, but you won't need a transformer.  This works equally well at home or abroad, so even if you don't have travel plans yet, you can safely buy it without any worry.My only complaint was that there seemed to be a bit of industrial grease (or something from the factory) on the handle when it arrived.  I briefly considered returning it, but was able to clean it off.  I'm not mentioning this to complain because as you can see from the rating, I love the curling iron.  I just am mentioning it in case anyone from the company sees it - I'm sure it was a one-time incident and it came off easily, but was a bit off-putting at first. I love this curling iron! I just purchased my second one because I want one for traveling. I have used my first one for about 5 years already and it still works! I was worried this barrel was too big for my hair (shoulder length) but it was perfect.  It gets the heat it needs to curl just right.  Great buy for the money! Love the curling Iron BUT it’s screws came out within months of purchase. Could no longer use iron within less then a year. This brand is worth every penny!  I have other tools that have been going strong for years.  This is great for a quick wave",2,4,-2

My wife loves the smell as well. A little goes a long way and does not weight down your hair or leave it with a oily/greasy feeling. After a shower I fry my hair leaving it a bit damp, slap some of this on my palm and work it into my hair then style. I will always have this in my restroom.

I have really thick, curly hair and these are great for gently getting through my hair even after it's gotten tangled on a windy day.  The combs themselves are a nice, larger size with a curve on one side, so they are very easy to hold onto.  They have a matte appearance so they won't get slippery.  They also come in beautiful colors for variety.  I just bought another set to give to my thinner texture, curly-haired daughter, who often suffers from a tangled mess of a head of hair. She is extremely pleased with them.  My four-year-old grandson, also with some curls, loves them too! They're attractive to a child since they look kind of fun!  Overall, I would highly recommend this product. I love these combs. My colors were white for the big one, and a purple for the small comb. I wanted the small comb to take with me when I travel. It is 3.5"" x 3.25"", which is small enough to fit in most pockets in bags. The wide tooth are great if you are brushing your wet hair. It doesn't rip at your hair like a brush does, which is very important when your hair is wet and weak. I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I use this comb to brush through my hair before I take a shower. The wide tooth is very good at getting the knots out without snagging and pulling your hair a lot. Some people said they felt it reduced hair frizz, but I didn't feel these combs did this. I still have normal amounts of hair frizz after use. Additionally, someone says it hardly pulls out hair. However, I feel that when I use these combs, I have a ton of hair that comes out. Probably nothing less than other hair picks I have used. If you are used to ripping through your hair with a brush, then it might be less hair coming out because you aren't breaking the hair off with this comb (because of the wide teeth). These were just what I was looking for.  I use the smaller one in the shower to distribute conditioner.  It works great.  The only thing I will say is that when I use a comb in the shower (I have used others in the past), I feel like a lot of hair comes out.  Also, when my hair has conditioner in it and it is combed out, it feels thinner.  But, when it's dry, it doesn't feel any thinner.  I am sure I am not the only person that notices this, but I thought I would just mention in case you worry about these things too.I have started using the bigger one in the morning if I washed my hair before bed.  I have fairly long hair and normally I just use a paddle brush on my hair after a shower or when getting ready.  I really like when my hair has a lot of body in the morning if my hair was damp when I went to bed the night before.  When I brush it, it takes away some of the volume.  I started using this comb instead and I think it looks much better.Wishing you great hair days! I just have to write a review. These combs are magical. I had almost given up getting a comb through my hair. I cut my hair almost 3 years ago to about an inch. Since then I've been on a natural hair journey.Today my hair is to my shoulders not flat ironed and a bit longer flat ironed. But I've not been able to keep it tangle free. I've bought really expensive neem combs and what not to wide tooth this or that. I've used detangling conditioners and leave ins. To no avail. It was mission impossible to keep it comb throughable. Well I decided to take a chance on the Cricket. What did I have to lose?I am soooo glad I did. It is life changing. The construction is good quality not a cheap plastic feel. It separates my hair without needlessly pulling it out. I don't know how or why it works but it does for me. I just love it. And love combing my long and still growing hair again. I will order more  just for backup in case they ever stop making them.Very happy with this purchase.Thank you Cricket. I really like these combs. The large one is great for going through wet hair. I’ve owned this for about eight years and just bought another pack because I lost the small one. I like to keep it in my makeup case. It doesn’t take up as much room as a brush. Quick wash in the dishwasher and it’s clean like new. Also, none of the plastic has broken / chipped like combs get when they’ve been own for a while. I really like cricket combs. I ordered the large handled white one to 'brush' my wet/dry hair and these ones for detangling in the shower. I bought these ones for in the shower to comb through my shampoo/conditioner since it seemed to be how they are marketed. I really like all of them. However if you are looking for the same thing I was, I think the handled large ones that come in the coconut and Argan infused additions would probably work really well in the shower as well maybe even instead of these. The other ones also come with openings In the plastic In which you could loop a rope through and hang it in the shower. Long story short, I like combs so I don't mind having each kind. If you don't really or want a one fits all in the bathroom, I would get the large handled one that comes in coconut or Argan.",1,5,-4

Handle broke off of my first one, so I expect the same to happen with this when it hits a big tangle, but honestly it works fine even with the handle broken off. Would certainly prefer if it was stronger, but I like the way these bristles are so I’ll keep buying even so. They don’t add static, and they brush through my thick straight hair well. I got it for wife and she loves it. Only says Excellent things about it. Works wonders with her hair type. I have been buying these brushes for my sons for several years now, and they both absolutely love them.  I initially purchased one for my son who has eczema as copper bristles were purportedly less likely to spread bacteria than other types of bristles.  Whether or not that was scientifically born out I cannot say, I can say he responded beautifully to this brush and absolutely loved it.  Before long his older brother decided he liked it as well and now this is the brush they both prefer so even though they are both in their 20's now Santa still brings them each a new one every year.  The few downsides I've noticed over the past decade or so may not come up if you strictly adhere to the directions on the package, but my men started using this brush as boys and this is what I've experienced.  If you brush wet hair with this brush the tines will eventually darken 'turn' or 'tarnish', we just consider this the part of wearing the brush out since my guys are so very hard on it with their off label use of using it constantly including every time they get out of the shower. It doesn't seem to mar effectiveness and we replace once a year.  This brush can also be hard to clean, hair comes off easily enough but lint wraps tightly around the metal tines. Once again that could also be attributed to water. This is not a brush for drying.All in all this brush is a family favorite, when I bought it I was looking for something to help with scalp health and I found that in spades.  I also found a brush not one but two men would still be asking for 8 years later. To give an idea of what hair I work with--I have medium-thick medium-brown hair mixed with some coarse white hairs. Hair is shoulder-length, straight, and layered.I haven't used a brush in several years. Just used my fingers in effort to reduce breakage and damage. Rounding the corner towards my mid-30s, my hair is undergoing some weird changes. Greasy, but dull. Coarse white hairs, my brown hairs thinning. So I need to step up my hair care game. Somehow or other copper bristles popped up in my research. For 7 bucks--what the heck--I'll give it a try.6 days later, I'm loving it. My hair is smoother and shinier (not glossy, so don't have any undue expectations--but it's enough to notice when moving in the light a nice healthy sheen). I use it 2-3x per day.I still use my fingers to detangle my hair prior to using it, otherwise you will regret it. This brush isn't for traditional brushing. It's a scalp massage and to redistribute your hair's natural oils. Doing this, not too many hairs get stuck in the bristles compared to other brushes or traditional brushing.I feel like I'm pampering myself. It won't change your world, but it does help you be a bit more mindful in how you take care of yourself and your hair. Now I'm going to look for a silk pillowcase to take my care a step further. My daughter had bought one of these for herself some time ago. I have an affinity for copper coloured anything, so it piqued my interest. I have used for the longest time brushes that are a mix of boar hair and nylon bristles (the stick kind that resemble the metal ones in this brush). The idea behind the boar hair is to drag oils down from the roots to the ends. Works pretty well, really, buuuuut nylon bristles always break at the tips so you wind up scratching your scalp. Plus, they don't catch knots very well.So... I decided to give this a go. Thus far, I am not seeing any ""anti-static"" or ""shinier"" effects others have mentioned (if anything, I have more static, but with super fine hair like mine, that kind of goes with the territory when there's too little humidity), but my hair does feel softer. I think it's due to getting all of the tiny knots (my hair loves to tie itself up, it seems). Another upside, it feels really good on the scalp. And, without the boar hair, I can really penetrate to the scalp much better than before.Overall, it's a brush. I don't expect to have movie star hair just because I am using it. But it seems well made, sturdy, and hasn't snagged or torn any hair, and my hair does at least feel smoother than before. I have been using this type of brush for many years, they do, as all brushes do break from time to time. After 4 years my last one broke and silly me did not think to look on Amazon for one, but after finally finding one at the Wal**** I decided to look here to see if they had them and they are cheaper here on Amazon. This is my favorite type of brush, as well as the favorite of my Daughter and Granddaughter. We all have very thick hair down to our lower back. This brush hold up so much better and does an amazing job on our hair. As for the dandrift control, I am not a medical professional, but I do have very bad psoriasis on the back of my head and when I am using this brush everyday it seems to get better. I was without this brush for about a year and the psoriasis became out of control. So glad I found this again!!! Will be ordering more as backups just in case Goody decides to stop making them. :D",3,5,-2

The information in this listing does not give you the specifics on that.  It is a 4oz. spray bottle.  Despite that, I am immensely happy with this purchase.I read the reviews, information and even checked the product website about this item.  I love that it is environmentally friendly and chemical free.  Everything I read about it was glowing and wonderful, so I decided to buy it to use on my 4-year-old.My daughter has fine, wavy hair that is prone to flyaways and has a lot of snarls every morning.  I use this liberally on her every morning.  Yes, you still have to comb through the snarls (they don't just disappear like magic), but this product helps as soon as it starts to get combed in.  Also, despite the quantity I use on her hair, there is no sticky, stiff residue like most of the brands you can buy at the store.  The smell is light and almost nondescript (which I prefer because of sensitivity to strong perfume or colognes).  Later in the day, when the product has been well absorbed and my daughter has been through her normal crazy play routines, her hair is soft, tame and frizz-free.I have also used this item on my hair as has my teenager.  It's amazing how great it stands up to my thick, curly hair's urge to frizz and my daughter's relentless, damaging heat-styling.  It is an amazing product and well-worth the price.  I think that this size, with the thickness of the solution in the bottle, will easily last as long, if not longer than 2 bottles of the stuff I could buy at the store.  That said, it really isn't that much more expensive than the other brands.If you are looking for something that is more substance than smell and will last all day while not putting chemicals on your (or your baby's) head, this is for you. They changed the product my review was on. I've never used the Tahitian Oil.I'm glad I got this. I actually bought it about a year ago and never wrote a review. It's great at detangling and making it easy when combing (my long,fine) hair would otherwise be a time consuming and tedious task I sometimes don't have the patience or the time to do. I guess what motivated me to write a review today is that yesterday and today I had static electricity in my hair that was becoming very annoying,flying up and sticking to the side of my face,so I got the idea to use this product and make it stop doing that. Which it has.Applying can be done in a few different ways. I tend to spray some (a dime sized dab)  into the palm of my hand and then rub both of my palms together and smooth it into areas where my hair needs it. It also works if you add a little water to your hands or put water into a small spay bottle and spray some Original Sprout Detangler into it and spray a very diluted mixture into your hair from a 2 to 4 ounce sprayer bottle that you can find almost anywhere.An added bonus is the conditioning it does to your hair in the next washing after you use it. I know this might sound a little dramatic, but this stuff has transformed my hair. I first heard about it on youtube from a girl who was promoting it to use with long hair. I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it. I ended it up using it on myself too and I cannot say enough good things about this product. It smells amazing for starters. It also really and truly detangles, which is great because I am growing my hair out and do not want to break any of it. Since I've started using it every day, I have received several compliments on how soft, healthy and shiny my hair looks. I use it liberally and it never makes my hair look greasy or filmy like some other leave-ins do. I have a hairdresser who is very loyal to Moroccan Oil products. He always wants me to use them, but I don't totally like what it does in my hair. Last time I saw him, he said my hair looked great and to keep using whatever I was using because it was doing really good things. I am hooked on this stuff and I hope it's around forever! This product is good, but there are two things that prevent me from buying it again - the smell/scent and the bottle. I'm guessing they recently change the bottle as it's different than that is pictured. The handle and top of the bottle are so little that it's tough to properly spray the product out. The top moves around and really makes it frustrating to use. At one point I just took the top off to get the product out. It also sprays out in very little doses. The scent is also way too strong for me.Now the positives - the product works great! I have twin 5 year olds; one with very tangly hair. It didn't get out all of her tangles, but it worked as well as any other product that I've tried, PLUS makes your hair super soft and shiny. More so than any other product I've tried.I won't buy this again mainly due to the scent - I'm sensitive to many smells and this one really bothered me. But I'm glad we tried it! I wish I had taken before/after pics, as there was an impressive difference with softness and shine. I have 3 bi-racial children, ages 5, 3, and 1.The all have curly hair that without detangler to comb out into lovely ringlets is a tangled frizzy mess and they are very vocal about the discomfort of having it combed out:(Thanks to the very high reviews everyone gave this product on avg, even though I literally did not have time to read them individually I ordered it.Its Fabulous!It really gets though the tangles and the kids love the smell.The care taken in making the product safe for our children is the icing on the cake.I will probably have to keep this in the house, you would think I was killing them when I comb their hair every morning up unitil now!Thanks again to all who took the time to come bk and review. Its a wonderful product and from now on I will do them same instead of being lazy LOL! Best hair oil ever. I have thick hair and shampoo with well water with lots of minerals that dry it out. Original Sprout is the best oil I’ve used. 10 pumps after shampooing and my hands love it too.",3,5,-2

It does have a smell as all aubrey shampoos do, but it is not overpowering to me. It cleans my fine, normal hair without drying it out. When my hair is short it is light enough to allow it to naturally curl without frizz. I consider aubrey shampoos to be concentrates, and dilute them 1 part shampoo to 3 parts water.Just some thoughts as to why some shampoos may work well for one person with short to medium length, fine, normal hair and not for someone else with the same type of hair: I have lived with city water and private well water. Shampoos that work with treated city water did not work the same with untreated well water. With city water shampoos did not even work the same depending on with what or when the water was treated. Also, shampoos did not work the same over time as hormones changed. I've been using this shampoo for several years now and I love it.  I have fine long hair and it doesn't dry my hair out.Anyone with fine hair might want to try taking NeoCell powdered Collagen.  I complimented a lady at Sprouts that had beautiful hair and she said that she started taking the NeoCell Collagen powder and that her hair had really thickened an grown. Consequently I started taking it and my hair has also grown and thickened.  Before by the time the new hair growth reached the length of my hair much of the ends would have fallen off so the bottom of my hair was almost translucent.  After about 1 1/2 years of taking the NeoCell the bottom of my hair is thick and definitely not translucent anymore. Hurray!! No longer do I have hair that smells like a a cheap date in high school.As a Pharmacist I worry about these highly aromatic chemicals we constantly expose our bodies to.Wonder why so many people in your world seem to be getting cancer at an earlier age? Don't discount the exposure we have to so many chemicals in our environment. The more we DON""T expose ourselves to- the better off we are in my opinion.The cost is a bit of a problem with this product but I am willing to pay for it. I still like the product, but it is much thinner (more watered down) than the ""old"" product.  Not having an old bottle to compare it with, I can't say for sure if the ingredients are identical, but it certainly is much thinner liquid - it used to be almost more toward the ""paste"" side of the spectrum than ""liquid.""  Now it freely flows.  Don't like that.  It also suggests that the product won't go as far (i.e. quicker re-ordering and therefore more revenue for the company at the customer's expense). I am really disappointed that they changed the formula. It is like a completely different shampoo.  I have been using Calagula Fern shampoo with luxurious results for years. I took a picture of the old ingredients (in white bottle on the left) and the new ingredients list (in pink bottle on the right). They added a lot more chemicals, also coconut oil (which many people are sensitive to), and fragrance, although they claim it is essential oil fragrance. personally i am allergic to 'fragrance' as listed on bottles and do not like the fact that the specific ingredients of essential oils is not disclosed. If that is what they are using, why not list it? The shampoo looks and smells totally different. The previous shampoo was thick dark brown, this new shampoo, looks like creamy peach commercial soap. If you were a fan of the old Calagual Fern Shampoo, you're not going to like this. This has all natural ingredients, many of them organic. It works really well for problem scalp conditions and leaves the hair feeling clean and healthy. It's viscous, smells like a plant, and runs all over the place, but I really do love this shampoo. A little goes a long way, but you have to add water to get it moving in your hair.  It suds nicely and, though it's not really my preference, the plant smell is earthy and kind of enjoyable. My only complaint is my own stupidity: after shaking the bottle, popping the top open makes shampoo go flying. This stuff likes to stain white shower liners, so make sure to pop the top open with your hand over it.  Problem solved.This keeps my hair looking cleaner longer than the soapnut shampoo I switched from.  All in all, it's worth the price to me. This shampoo really cleans the oils out of your hair. I feel like my hair is less oily the next day and while I do wash everyday, I use a less cleansing shampoo so I don't completely strip it. I have very fine but dense hair and it responses with volume and body. The product is brown and concentrated, so it takes some effort to get it spread throughout your hair. It does lather really nice and creamy. The only negative is the product leaks out of the cap if the bottle falls over, which seems to happen a lot in my shower. This is a great natural product and I think I will keep it on hand.",5,4,1

I did the patch test and all was well  to use the product on my head 11 day progress.  Consistency is key. This is my nape area.  I use the Ors hair lotion to moisturize.  Then these oil in trouble area.  In addition I bought edge scarfs so my nape doesn’t rub on pillow.  NOT a Regular scarf cause it would lift up.  Tbh I don’t even buy extra products.  Use what u have at home like hair lotion and this product. I began using this right away in the front of my scalp (for my bangs) and edges.

Love how it gets them cast without the frizz! Dries hair quick. Quiet. Love the longer cord. Hit the buttons when changing hand position. I bought my previous exact same model in 2011--quite satisfied.  It was my fault for not cleaning the filter but lasted 11 years anyway!  Works great, not that much noise and is light.  (I don't use the attachments supplied, so I can't review those.  Btw, the price was only about 33% more than it was 11 years ago, effectively making it cheaper.  I was so glad to hear they are still made--no shopping necessary.  (although it did not affect me personally much, they shortened the cord by about a foot (approx 27 cm).  It did affect a side use though. Love this. Not too heavy & has good settings My hair dresser used and she loves it. The blow dryer dries hair great. Love the weight, the long cord but I continuously turn it off because of where the control buttons are. Have not figured out a way to use it without doing it which is incredibly annoying.

They have changed the smell over the years and I’m not real happy about that. But I love the way it makes my hair look and feel. I am going through postpartum hair loss. Every time I wash my hair is becomes one big knot. This stuff really moisturizes my hair and makes it a lot easier to brush after the shower. The smell is great too. Reminds me of candy in a way. I admit I'm still on the fence about this conditioner. I've been having a lot of trouble with static in my dry hair, along with itchy scalp, this winter and have tried a slew of different conditioners. I know Nexxus to be a popular brand so I thought I'd give it a go.This is a thick, opaque white liquid about the viscosity of pancake batter. A little goes a long way, so keep that in mind. I spread it on freshly washed hair and leave it on while finishing washing in the shower. I rinse it last. I knew it might not be enough for me the first time I rinsed it as my hair made that squeaky sound as I was rinsing.At night I wear a fabric headband to hold my hair back to wash my face. When I remove the headband, I have staticky hair where the band has been. It's not as bad as without this conditioner, but I thought the static would be gone after using this conditioner. Nope.I'll continue to use this conditioner as it does a little something, but I won't buy it again. I’ve turned a lot of people onto this product. They all were very happy I did. It does provide serious moisture back into your hair. I have noticed over the years the product has become less effective as it was years ago.  I stopped coloring my hair years ago as well so it should be moisturizing even more. Either an ingredient has been removed or changed out. Permit was a ingredient needing to be removed. We learn everyday. It’s still my fav on the market. It helps put moisture back in considerably and it doesn’t effect my scalp. Smells good too. Makes my my hair feel and look great. This product is always amazing. I have used it for years. But I want to call attention to the packaging in which a shipper FINALLY taped over the top to prevent leaking. This is everything! Well done!",1,5,-4

reviews, I know that I’m not loosing it. I purchased this item and as soon as I used it the first time, I thought it was a bootleg version. As others have commented, the spray nozzle is no longer a mist, but definitely squirt gun. HORRIBLE. I’ve been trying to find out if this company still exists or is no longer operating as I can no longer find this product anywhere. This used to be a staple in my hair care routine. The actual product itself was amazing before they changed the bottle spray nozzle. Perhaps the formula has changed, not sure but I didn’t like that it didn’t spray from the bottle. I had to sent an unused bottle back. This company doesn’t exist anymore. The website is down, no Facebook page, gone. They must be selling the remaining product which sucks. I called them in New York and they confirmed the Jane Carter line no longer exists. But I don’t know why at the 11th hour they’re changing the formula and adding this completely stupid spray nozzle that other people have commented on doesn’t actually mist but rather shoots like a squirt gun with its force. And it’s obviously the product because using the old sprayer nozzle does exactly the same thing. Apparently theparticle size of the product is too large to go through a mister type nozzle. Something you might want to check before you sell it to customers.And agreed, the new product with less natural ingredients doesn’t work nearly as well as it used to. Love this product. It is has a refreshing scent and leaves the hair soft I was looking for a quality leave-in conditioner being that I ran out of Organix conditioner. I came across this product, researched some reviews and became convinced to purchased it. After the first use; I've noticed that the product is really good for de-tangling and for dry hair. It leaves the hair soft and even softer when paired with a complimentary oil such as EVOO or a serum like Organix Coconut Milk anti-breakage serum. My hair was recently colored and it didn't fade my hair color at all; if anything it gave my hair a lively shine to a dark color treated hair like mine. The fragrance is very subtle, it doesn't linger and it aids in good for blow drying. The one thing that I want Jane Carter to do is create a cream based version of this for more control of the product and the winter/fall months for that the hair needs something that sticks to coated the hair in order to protect it from extreme cold weather and wind; other than that its definitely a 5/5 star rating; it's worth the money. I love this product and have been using for years however they have a new disign to the bottle which I hate.  The new design doesn't allow  the product to come out properly.  I see a lot of products are using this design not sure why I have type 4b hair. The first time I used this leave-in, my hair was stiff. I had used it with another leave-in, a serum and followed with a moisturizer and sealant. So I can't say if it was what contributed to the stiffness of my hair. On my next wash day, I used only one leave in and very little moisturizer. My hair was very soft. I used this the following day as a light spritz and my hair is moisturized and still soft. I've been using it this way and it really keeps my hair soft. It is also a great detangler. I will try it again on a wash day and use it as the only leave-in and see how it turns out.Update: I've stopped using it because it still makes my hair stiff! I can't reduce the rating so that's why it's still a 4-star rating!! Love this product!  I had used it years ago and found it again recently and am so glad I did!  My hair is wavy and slightly curly, but gets super frizzy if humid outside and this stuff helps to make my curls curlier while keeping the hair soft at the same time but doesn’t weigh it down either.  And keeps the frizzies at bay too!",1,1,0

Irritation - Glowing Skin - Home Cleansing - Refreshing - Natural Glow - Pedicure Regimen - Long Lasting,"So first and foremost, ill admit im an ER nurse. I am around sick people constantly, and started using tea tree about 5 years ago. I have 12 years RN exp, FEMA training, and 4 yrs CNA exp. Also BLS/PALs/ACLS/stroke cert/NRP/et el.Disclaimer- these are anecdotal results. But,  Hear me out:I am currently around covid patients, every day.  I have yet to have an episode of such since the pandemic. I also test twice a week. And am vax w/o booster.When I have a sore throat, i swab with t.tree. Just enough to get a q-tip wet. Wring it out on the glass bottle so its not dripping, and twice on the back of the throat like a strep swab from your MD.BE PREPARED to have a visceral reaction the first time you do this!  I almost threw up, definitely dry heave worthy.I also swab both my nares (nostrils), then throat, and now jump in the shower to ‘get right’. Have the shower ready to hop in; Phlegm out n then drink something warm, & go to sleep. (This is if feeling sick regime, btw) wake up like a million bucks, or at least not ill.Also helps if sick with post-nasal drip, sinus congestion, but please do get checked by an MD for treatment should signs/symptoms persist or worsen. You will sneeze also- be prepared (sneeze & shower remember/or both)I swab my ears/wet side ; then dry them with this if i have an ear ache or sinus thing also.Tea tree is edible, NOT eucalyptus oil!!! Eucalyptus oil is TOXIC, even in small quantities if eaten. Eucalyptus is topical only or diffuser.I will say, ONLY SWAB ONCE A DAY! Anymore than that and tea tree can give u cramping diarrhea. (Ask me how i know)Never use in eyes, or inside sex organs/glands.Topically, tea tree will also stop bug-bite-itch, reduce inflammation, has anti-bacterial/anti-viral properties, and smells lovely in diffusers for young ones to get the same benefits as above. (Avoid swabbing less than 2 yr olds as it burns/stings) and it can be diluted should full strength be too much. : 1 part tree/ 2 parts h2O light, 1:1 medium, or full strength. And can be used in spray bottles like ‘fabreez’ odor eliminator sprays.Remember: all orfices lead to each other in your head. Ears/sinus/nose/throat. So- adjustHave read/aware that teatree works on warts, fungal toes, fungal odors, jock itch (not inside urethra), athlete’s foot, cuts/scraps, and acne.  Also rub on hair/neck to keep bugs away (like after-shave/mousse). Herpes/cold sores also- but for me only if i feel the “tingle” aura on my lip will rubbing oil on my lip like chap stick help- with full outbreak/ abreva works better. Its a chemistry thing- so go with your body! Can also help body odor with appliances to arm pits prior to sleep (not in lieu of deodorant), eczema will lessen, and it can help with thrush (mouth) -however other things do taste better for that.Please use best judgment, and should you (the reader) be a person that judgment not be a trait you possess, ask a medical person/ family/ friend/ etc; see a doctor!  Not for open sores or gaping wounds!As for this product, 2oz at $16 for the best brand desert essence is a good deal. My local market sells 1 oz at $12. Usually 1oz lasts me about a year. As long as you keep it bottled, stored in dark cabinet, and clean (no double dips with dirty q-tips), it will last quite well. Noticed the seller sells both newer logo and older logo brand. The one i got was fresh tasting and newer. Time does age the taste to more bitter. Older is better for topical in my opinion- but i dont exactly know if it ‘goes bad’ per say.As for toxic CA disclaimer- dont eat the label that the ink is printed on, or the plastic/resin top and you should be just fine!Enjoy!(I’ll waive the $50 for my co-pay)Disclaimer- my review is not intended to skip a medical doctor’s evaluation. Please seek medical advice, should you have a medical condition or emergency. I've used Desert Essence before, and was very happy to find it again. The bottle was glass, as it should be, and the price was good, plus the quality of the oil is great. Warning that you better not drink it because it is toxic if injested,, still this is my favorite antiseptic solution to heal and clean scrapes, topical wounds, etc. Research uses and dilute. Tea tree oil is a great product. Bottle was larger then one I got at store a d cheaper. Great quality It may seem expensive but it goes a really long way Tea tree is always a good and acceptable in the price for this bottle was just right My acne is so bad that I have an acne prescription from my older brother. But I do not like this treatment because my skin starts peeling an you can imagine how often I have to exfoliate... I am trying to find something that can help so i don't have to use my medication that often. People say do dilute it but honestly I don't do that, I put a drop or two on my cotton ball and I'm fine. But obviously you should check if this product will annoy your skin, I checked on my chin when I first received the product to see if my skin will react badly to the product. My skin was strong enough... If you have sensitive skin or even semi-sensitive skin dilute it. If your skin is strong enough then test it somewhere on your face. When I put this product it stings for a minute or two and then my skin is fine. This has definitely helped my skin with my acne and it is now one of my staples. I even put it in my aloe-vera moisturizer and I made a good decision. So as long as you get ANY 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil you will get the same results I got. The reason why this bottle is so small is because this stuff lasts for a very long time (the average is like 3 months) but I replaced it every month because I would use this product a couple times a day. This product is pretty expensive and I found a tea tree oil that comes in 4 oz and is around $5 (it was off of amazon) and now I use that. Don't be afraid to find other brands they all do the same (as long as it is 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil). My brother puts this in his shampoo and my dad uses it for anti-fungus or something. This product has so many uses and it definitely an amazing product. I love the smell too, the scent is very clean and refreshing.",5,2,3

They hold my hair up very well compared to so many others out there. This is my go-to hair clip.  I have long, fine hair so the regular clips slip down and I'm constantly readjusting my hair.  The grip on the inside of these are the perfect solution to prevent that from happening.  These have always lasted me a long time before I eventually wear them out with a lot of use so I'm happy to repurchase when that eventually happens. Love these This thing definitely allows my hair to slip out of it sometimes. Unless I use it when my hair is wet, my hair will inevitably fall right out. It does seem more durable than most clips, but it’s not as grippy as I had hoped. Very good grip on my hair. I bought second pair for whenever it breaks. I usually break them eventually but this one is sturdier then other ones I used in the past Great clip, but don't order it because it is now discontinued and I want to get them ALL!!!! (-: This is the only clip that holds all my hair in a ""ponytail"" all day with no slipping.Just want to put in a good word for the seller NY Discounts, I had a bit of a self-inflicted mixup with my order, and when I contacted them to ask a question they responded the same day with the information and extra help I needed to fix my problem. I have pretty full thick hair which is layered and shoulder length, but unless you have very long hair this clip may be too big for you. It works perfectly fine, but I've gone back to my other clips since this one sat up above my head a little bit. This is a very large clip.  Holds hair fine - but smaller ones also work well.

Thank you who makes it. The hairbrush works very well and is nicer than another one that I purchased at the food store.  The only thing that I don't like is the color.  The one I received is red. I've had a previous version of this brush before and liked it better. This one is made mostly out of plastic so it doesnt have much give when brushing. But thats because of the updated design with the open back to allow for more ventilation when blow drying.Overall, does the job, drys my hair faster! I've been using this kind of Goody brush for years and I love it! It takes all the excess water out of my hair. My cats loves to be brushed with this little brush! I have been buying this brand for years. I usually buy my brushes at the food store or the drug store. However, the stores do not have the selection they used to, and I needed help finding the go-to items I needed. I have been looking for a  smaller round brand for months and finally went on amazon. I have this size and a smaller round brush I always use that needed to be replaced.  If you have straight, short hair, this works great. It gives my hair volume. I love the Goodie brand, and it is excellent for its value. Have bought this brush in the past and will always go back to it! Definitely worth it, especially if you have thick hair like me If your curly/wavy hair is prone to knotting, this brush is good(y). Lol But seriously, if you don’t mind the pain of brushing out the knots more efficiently than a wet brush with softer bristles, then this is the brush for you.",1,4,-3

Air Brush Styler,"I have used this exact type Con-Air Hot Air Brush for the last 20 years and almost panicked when my last one started to get weak and I was not able to find a replacement immediately. I was so afraid these had been discontinued but finally found this one, where the vendor was out of stock, but taking back-up orders. What a relief! I had to wait for some time, but was finally notified that it was back in stock and had been shipped. They sometimes last for 3 or 4 years, but I'm going to order a back-up (or 2), just in case! I absolutely love this drier. I’ve used this model for the past 10 years (I’ve replaced twice). I’ll continue to buy because it works just that good. It gives salon quality blow out. My hair is curly/wavy and average thickness. I've worn it pretty short for most of my life, for convenience, but a few times I've let it grow out; I enjoy the versatility although it's more hassle. About 8 months ago I decided to let it grow out again and, although it's definitely at an awkward stage (just touching my shoulders and the sides aren't quite long enough to stay behind my ears, the front keeps dropping down in my face if I don't style it), this device is really helping.My hair is curliest around my face and, as it grows, it starts to do this sausage-roll thing, no matter how carefully I style it with the round brush while drying it. If it's already dry, I have to break out the hot rollers. Well, not anymore!The only drawback for me is that it claims to be a dryer as well as a straightener, and it's not powerful enough to dry my hair, at least not as quickly as I'd like. It's only 700 watts (my regular dryer is 1875). So I use the 1875 to dry my hair and then I use the straightener on my hair when it's dry.Where it REALLY shines (sorry for the pun) is on those days when I don't need or want to shampoo and do the whole routine. I can straighten and style VERY easily in just a couple of minutes during the morning routine, and I end up with sleeker lines than I've EVER gotten with the brush and dryer, plus I get the shine too! Another way it saves time is that, since it IS marketed as a dryer, it's ""hot"" right away instead of having to wait for it to heat up (like rollers), and cools down quickly after you've turned it off. After literally just a couple of minutes, I go from bed-head to sleeker lines and more shine than I'd EVER get with the brush and dryer!The heat settings (high, low, cool) are on a thumb-push switch just below the teeth of the comb, but I have to confess I haven't figured out the different settings controlled by the knob at the top. It definitely clicks as you turn it but nothing obvious changes on the lines of the comb itself, and that knob has no labels or symbols. I did read the instructions and learned that it somehow controls the thing's strength but I still can't tell how. Lucky for me, I've got it on a good setting.The cord is nice and long - well over 6' - and the plug has a ground fault interrupter. It's light and the grip feels natural and balanced and doesn't get hot, and the business end is angled just a tiny bit which feels right.There's no telling how many different curling irons, hot brushes, and rollers I've bought over the years tryingto get this kind of control and results. In addition to enjoying (and being grateful for) the time I save with it, and the improved results, now I'm really excited to have my hair longer so I can see what this thing can do with that! Takes longer to dry, but is lightweight and hair is shinier and a lot less frizz than with super powerful, super hot hair dryers. I was writing a review for another hot hair styling tool and it reminded me that I’ve never written a review for this hot air brush, even though it’s been my favorite styling brush for almost 11 years (yes it’s lasted that long).This was a second purchase back in Aug 2008 of the same product that I had at home. The first one didn’t break, my dad was doing some home improvement and got construction debris all over my it that I tossed it out of safety concerns.This little brush works just as well in 2019 as it did back in 2008. It’s moved with me at least 3 times over the course of 11 years, and survived all the moving. I use the highest heat setting on my thick coarse wavy hair, and can usually finish straightening and styling my hair from wet to dry in about 15 minutes.I only gave it 3 star rating for travel because of its size and voltage. I’m a light traveler, this takes up enough space as a pair of flats would, so I don’t usually bring it with me on trips. There was one occasion where I brought it to Hong Kong on vacation, and even with the voltage converter, the brush just started and abruptly shut down. It worked fine after I took it back to the US. Between the amount of space it takes up and the fact that it may not work overseas, I’ve never taken this traveling again. That doesn’t change the fact that this remains my favorite of all time for drying and styling my hair.Last year, while I was on vacation (didn’t bring hair styling tools and didn’t like the hotel shampoo) I spent close to $200 on a blowout between the cost of the service and the tip. While chatting with my stylist, she was telling me about her favorite Conair tool after I told her about this one. We both agreed that some common brands such as this one that you can easily purchase online and even in some local drug stores, work a lot better than the hot new high tech brands that costs hundreds of dollars in beauty specialty stores. So if you’re thinking about making this purchase, go for it, you won’t regret it. I have very thick coily natural hair and I use this dryer when I want my hair to be straight. Everyone who I show this dryer to wants one. I have been using mine for probably 10 years and have repurchase only once. I will keep coming back to this hair dryer every time.",1,5,-4

It was always so soft and beautiful and the chemicals changed it. It's been 2 years since that camp and her hair was STILL like that! Never going back to its natural, soft beauty. I was SO sad. We signed up for some serious swimming at our gym and I added in the 5 yr old this time. We swam 4-5 times a week. I started using this shampoo after every swim and not only did we all keep our hair in great shape, but my oldest daughters hair is actually going back to its original soft sweetness!! I don't know and can't day for sure if it's this shampoo. Too many variables since 2 years have passed since the sever damage, BUT, she has long hair, so it's not all new hair growth and it was still terrible, plastic-like and horrible to brush every day since that fateful swim summer. All I know is tha since we've been using this, my hair, the little one's hair and her hair have been perfectly normal, and in her case, repaired. It's at about 90% back to its original shape fromTWO years ago. Crazy, right? Plus this shampoo is so cheap, I hardly expected this miracle from it. I've also started washing out our swimsuits with it to save the color and material. Seems to work well!! I have shoulder length, naturally blond hair and I am usually in the pool 3-4 days a week. I have always used Paul Mitchell's Shampoo Three which is designed to get chlorine out. That product always worked well for me but as a clarifying shampoo it can be very harsh/drying on my hair. I got the Ultra Swim to use everyday after swimming and now I only use the Paul Mitchell once a week along with a deep conditioning mask. This combo works well for me. The Ultra Swim doesn't get all the chlorine but leaves my hair fairly moisturized during the week and on Sundays the Paul Mitchell shampoo gets the rest of the buildup, and the deep conditioner really replenishes.If you're a swimmer I can also recommend I am a male with thick brown hair, new to the world of swimming.  I started swimming in a chlorine-filled pool 3 or 4 times a week in the last couple months.  I am happy to say this shampoo has restored my hair to 85% of its former self.  Nevertheless, I think I need an additional stronger chlorine removal product and/or a really good conditioner.  Please note that the number one ingredient in this shampoo is water.  Thus, Ultraswim shampoo comes very quickly out of these bottles. The first few times I used it, I squeezed the bottle way too hard and wasted a lot of shampoo.  As a new swimmer, I will continue to use this product, but I have to find something more...Review edit 6 months later: Initially when writing my review, my hair was still in pretty bad shape after not using any special chlorine removal products for a couple of months.  However, after repeated uses of this shampoo after swims and a separate unrelated conditioning product, my hair is regularly in 95%+ normal condition.  I now fully recommend this product.  Don't forget to load up on good conditioner... I use this on my 5 year old daughter's hair 3-4 times per week.  She's been in swim lessons once a week now for over a year, and the smell of chlorine was really building up in her hair.  This works better than regular shampoo.  The smell of chlorine is still there a bit, but nothing like before.  She never cries if it gets in her eyes either.  It seems to be gentler than the normal drugstore shampoo I had been using on her.  The smell is clean, and beats smelling the chlorine on her any day.  The price here is a bit cheaper than when I bought my first bottle at Walgreens to try it out.  I have never seen it in any other store, so buying online is a good choice. I swim 3 times a week in a pool that uses chlorine as well as a saline solution to clean the water. I have naturally blond hair which is also very fine and prone to breakage. I used to have problems with my hair turning green from the chlorine, but now after using this shampoo I don't have a problem with it.I make sure to wash my hair immediately after leaving the pool and use a generous amount of the shampoo so as to work up a good lather. Although the instructions do not say to, I usually let it sit on my hair for a few minutes before rinsing. In order to keep my hair soft and damage free I follow with a concentrated conditioner. Once it's dry I put about a teaspoon of olive oil in my hair using a soft bristled brush to distribute it. My hair is always silky soft and has no split ends or other damage.The shampoo does a very good job at removing chlorine as well as other minerals that can damage hair. I really love it. What makes a great company isn't when you buy a product and are happy with it, few can screw that up.  What makes a great company is how the react when something goes wrong.  I experienced my first problem with amazon after 100 orders.  When I received this order one bottle was completely empty, it had leaked out all of the inside of the box.  I was annoyed, but it's amazon so I knew it would be ok.  I went through their return process which was quite simple.  The next day the UPS guy picked up the product from my front porch and two days later I had a new one, at no return or additional shipping costs to me.  I had to ship back all 4 bottles which is silly, but it's a big company, they have all this automated on their end - I get that.As for the product, it's great.  I swim 3 times a week and without this stuff my hair becomes like wire. I got 4 bottles (been using it for years). One was 8.80oz, one was 7.25oz, one was 5.55oz and one was 8.65oz. They were supposed to be 7 oz each. Don't know why they didn't have the same amount in each bottle but the total was actually 30.25 instead of 28oz, so guess I can't complain.",2,5,-3

I hope I save someone from wasting their money. Product is very good but my thin hair would do better with the brush needles type wand.  I sometimes can’t get wand out of hair easily as it is tangled in the wand.  Hair very short.  I still use it, but a little more cautiously. I’ve been using these for years and just needed a new one. It works well with my fine hair. I love this small, lightweight brush and it helped me start down a proper path for my short, multi-textured, soft, thin(ning), natural hair.  But, it's also a victim of its own success! As I grew to rely upon the brush in my hair styling, I began to see its limitations, i.e., leaving my hair a bit puffy and frizzy, which ultimately was not a problem (since the style most chosen was one that involved, essentially, bangs protruding from a hat or scarf), I began to want the brush to smooth more than it could. The issue: there is no heat setting for the user; there's only ONE heat level and its factory-determined, lol! You plug it in; the light goes on; it heats up (and it's not instant or even fast); you use it.  Still: I love what it was able to show me re: possibilities. My hair is too thin and soft for curling irons (which destroy any measure of body or fullness); irons also are skin burn hazards.  Such concerns are a non-issue with this brush, thanks to the ""protective"" bristles.I'm giving it 4 stars: It's really 4.5 stars-worthy.  It's cute, safe, harmless, and pretty effective. I ordered this to replace my old but still working hot brush.  I am disappointed in this one because it takes much longer to heat up and the indicator ready light does not work as described.  These are difficult to find so I will keep this as a back up but it is inferior to the previous ones available to purchase.  Time has not improved this hair styling tool. I just wanted something inexpensive for a little lift and this works. The ready light didn't work but the brush is hot enough to just lift and smooth. I can see how this can get tangled in your hair if not careful. My hair looks like I put a few rollers in which isn't too bad for the price. I thought this would have an on/off switch for heat; instead you plug it in and wait at least 10 minutes to reach a maximum heat of ""warm.""  It will curl fine hair if held for a while.  No instructions were included. This didn't heat up enough to curl my fine straight hair. It took a really long time for it to get hot. I threw it away.",1,4,-3

3-Month Supply","Updated 3/21/2015Thought I would update my review, now that I have been using the product for about a year. I have to say that I am pretty please with the results so far. My hair is certainly thicker and in better shape than it was prior to my using Rogaine. I have continued the routine I outlined in my original review below. Now I am not saying that I have the same head of hair as I did in my twenties, I am afraid those days are gone, I can clearly see where my hair is thinner when my hair is wet. However when it is dry, I no longer see my scalp  when there is a light source behind me, as I could before I started using the Rogaine.  Interestingly, I think I am just coming out of a bit of a thinning phase again, though nowhere near as bad as the initial shed I went through when I started using the product. Even during this thinning phase however, my hair never got as thin as it was before I started using the product. However, I seem to be through this phase now, and I am seeing plenty of fine hairs growing in again.As these fine hair mature they do indeed darken and thicken. So I guess what I am trying to say is that you may still go through some cycles of shedding and regrowing.  I guess as long as we get the regrowth, I can deal with the occasional shed.So in synopsis, what I have to say is this is a worthwhile product if you are willing to give it a real try. If it doesn't work out for you, it is not the end of the world, I still think the guys who embrace their baldness look much better than the guys who try and cover it up.  I hope that if I reach a point where I am only fooling myself about my hair loss, that someone will let me know, and then I too will embrace the loss, and cut my hair short. But at least for now, that is decision that I do not have to make. I don't have any doubts that as of right now, my hair is better off than it was a year ago, and how many times in life do you get to say something like that? Anyway, good luck to all.Original  PostDefinitely getting new hair growth. I am 42 year old male who always had a thick head of hair. I was quite shocked to notice late last year that my hair was thinning out, specifically in the front left portion of my head. It had never occurred to me that I might have to face thinning hair/baldness, so I took it quite hard. Now I was not bald, but I was beginning to notice more scalp showing through my hair, especially when there is an overhead light. On the advice from my dermatologist, I bought my first can from the drug store, after that, I bought a 3 month supply from Amazon. As far as the cost goes there is no comparison, I think the 3 month supply cost about the same amount as the single can did from the drug store. A can does last me about a month, I am only using it in the thinning area in the front left hand portion of my head, and I try to use the recommended amount of half a capful, twice a day.Now for the nitty-gritty portion of my review. As others have mentioned before, I think you have to have your mind set prior to begin using this product. I think you have to be prepared to give this product a try for 4 months. I think you need to have reasonable expectations set, and an idea of how far you are willing to go to try and retain your hair. If you are going into this trial unsure if you are going to be able to do complete it, I think I would recommend against using it. You will certainly lose more hair at the onset. I was certainly worse off a month into using the product then I was at the onset. This was very discouraging.  I was seeing some hair growth after  a few weeks, but looking back on this now, I think these were just replacing some of the hair that this product caused to fall out in the first place, and not really new additional hair growing in.  Thankfully these little hairs growing in encouraged me enough to keep going. If I had stopped after 6 weeks, I would have been far worse off.As I said before, I was not bald but thinning, and my goal was just to try and keep my scalp covered. Now that I am about 4 months in, I can definitely say that I see a lot less scalp showing through, even when there is an overhead light, or I am out and the Sun is overhead. When I part my hair, I see loads of small hair growing in. I also see hair growing in along the front of my hairline, even though the product says it will not work there. Now most of these hair are very fair in color, and do not seem to have much volume on their own,  (I can tell however, that some of the older longer ones are darkening and might be thickening as well. I have some that are dark at the end, but are fair at the base)  However, I think these fair hair are providing me with what I was hoping. Essentially filler, so that I do not see so much scalp through my hair. I do not expect to have as much hair as I did when I was young, I just don't want to be in that in between state of having hair, and rocking the bald look. So far it has met my expectations.I also think it is helpful to have an idea of how far you are willing to go to keep your hair. My dermatologist recommended this product, but also mentioned the idea of propecia. Now I was willing to try this because their did not seem to be too many side effects, however I made up my mind before I started that I was not willing to go that far. Between the possible side effects, and the cost, I did not think it was worth it, and this brings me to my last point. I had to accept the very real possibility that I might lose my hair (and still might). For the first time, I began to take notice of how other men dealt with their hair loss. I have to say, that it is not even close, men who embraced the fact that they are losing/lost their hair, and decided to roll with it , look far better than the guys who try and cover it up. The guys who either shave their hear or cut it real close look far superior to the guys who try and do a comb over type thing. They seem to look far more comfortable and confident, in short, they look good. I decided if this stuff did not work for me, then I will try and embrace the change, and cut my hair short, that would be better than fretting about how it was looking, whether the wind was blowing it out of place, etc. I think that is the best advice I can offer about this whole thing.  However, at least for the moment since this product does seem to be thickening my hair, that is a decision I can put off for now.Now for the last part of my novella here, as far as the actual routine of using twice a day, it is not too bad when you get in a routine. The first application I usually have to do at the gym in the morning after I shower. My hair is usually wet during this application. This stuff does seem to act like a mousse, holding my hair in place for the rest of the day, so I don't use anything else. The second application is at night, shortly before bed, and my hair is usually dry at this application, so I get one wet and one dry application.  Seems to be working for me. The actual application only takes a couple of minutes, and I kind of like the smell. I would also mention that I started taking 3K biotin, which you can buy at a drug store. I also started using that Nexus Shampoo available here on Amazon. Kind of expensive, I seem to like it, though I have only used it a handful of times so far, so I can't gauge if it actually does anything. So in synopsis, here is my review. Working well on thinning hair (not bald), be prepared to give it an extended try or you will certainly be worse off for an aborted try, have reasonable expectations, know how far you are going to go with the whole process, baldness is not the end of the world, and may indeed be a good option. Also if you are going to try this, certainly buy it here rather than at a drug store.Good luck! I'm tired of reading all the fluff in these reviews and watching videos for minutes on end for people to get to the point. The short answer is ""YES"" rogaine DOES WORK. It's working for me. New hairs grew all over my scalp. My hairline got darker, bald spots all started to fill in and I have more hair on my head. This all happened in 7 months of use. But, rogaine has its drawbacks.Why 3 stars? First and foremost, this is a treatment. Not a cure. That means you need to keep purchasing and applying rogaine to keep your results. Additionally, I noticed side effects. The worst side effect is the acne that magically appeared on my forehead. Before rogaine, I had a clear, smooth forehead. Now, it looks like a minefield. I have acne all over my forehead and I'm forced to use other products to treat it. If I wasn't breaking out so badly, I'd give this product 4 or maybe 5 stars. The acne is bad and I hate having to deal with it but it's not bad enough for me to quit rogaine.Nonetheless, the other side effect that I'm experiencing is that I've grown additional hair on my shoulders and back. To put it into perspective, for every inch of skin, I have grown about 2 or 3 thick, dark, hairs. My solution to this is to simply yank them off every few weeks. This side effect isn't much of a problem. I look like a gorilla anyway!Definitely buy the foam version of rogaine if you're going to try this product out. I tried the other versions and it makes your scalp flakey. The foam version doesn't have that problem. I apply it every morning when I wake up and every night before going to sleep all over my head. I'm pretty sure the packaging says to not use it in the frontal area of the head but I simply don't care. I use it all over my head. The logic behind this behavior is that if it's working for the back, why not apply it to the front as well? And, I'm quite pleased with the results. My hairline is darker and thicker.I saw noticeable results in the 3rd month of use. I DID NOT go through a ""shedding"" phase like other people mention. I'm going into my 7th month now and I have a gut feeling that there WILL NOT be anymore new hairs growing out. It seems to have plateaued. Which is fine. But, maybe I'm wrong. Only time will tell. I wasn't expecting to look like Tarzan just by using this product anyway (although that would have been sick)I do not have a before picture of my head because I was super embarrassed about my hair loss. I took 0 pictures of myself for months. In fact, I wore a cap 24/7. You can see my acne in the picture that I uploaded. All the hair on my head in the photo came from rogaine. Prior to rogaine, my hair looked like somebody had attacked with a trimmer. Few hairs in one spot, some dark, bald in other spots.*** 2 YEAR UPDATE ***I’ve plateaued. There aren’t any more new hairs appearing and none of the existing hairs have been getting thicker. This has been the case after 1 year of use.The reason to continue using rogaine is to “keep the gains” (to keep all the rogaine related hair growth)The acne is not nearly as bad as it used to be. In fact, the acne now versus the acne in the beginning isn’t even comparable. I barely have a thing on my forehead 2 years in. I didn’t use any products to clear my acne. I champed it out and let my body do it’s thing. It was clearly a reaction to some of the chemicals within the rogaine that was causing the severe acne. My forehead was MESSED UP for the first 6 months of rogaine usage...I’ve not grown my hair out since I began using rogaine. I decided to keep the same length as in the first picture because this product can’t (and never will) restore my hair to what it was before the balding.If you’re balding, embrace it (easier said than done) There’s simply nothing that I’m aware of that will bring your hair back to it’s original form. I heard great things about hair transplants when done correctly. However, I know people who’ve gotten hair transplants that look so ridiculously terrible that you’d be better off bald. Is it even worth it? Not in my opinion.PRP hair treatment a lord of horse crap. I had it done several times and I’ve not seen ANY results from it. A complete waste of my time and money.Finestride (Propecia) worked for my buddy. He had no noticeable side effects and his hair looks pretty darn good. I don’t know if it would yield the same results for me + I’m not risking it. I’d rather be bald than have erectile dysfunction. There’s no need to mess with your hormones to grow a few crappy hairs on your head. No matter what you do, people can still tell that you’re balding. So, no need to hide it.True story for all of you guys who’re balding. I’ve slept with some of the most beautiful women when I became bald. I couldn’t do it when I had hair. It was shocking for me to believe at first but it’s the complete, honest to God truth. Ever since I’ve been having these encounters with beautiful women, I stopped caring as much.The moral of the story is, try rogaine out. See how you react to it. If it’s too expensive or has side effects, stop using it. There’s really no need. Embrace that you’re balding. Accept it. Move on with your life. Women dig bald guys. I swear! You just have to be confident and realize that this is something you have no control over.If you want to draw attention away from your hair, get your nose and ears pierced. Not only does it look cool but people tend to see those pieces of jewelry instead of immediately noticing your head. Good luck my bald bro’s! This is something you want to use before you are completely bald.I started using this when I noticed a bald spot starting at the very top back of my head .I have been using this for a little over 2 years. At first your hair will thin a little more for about a month.Wear a hat if you can but then it comes back.The oackage says that it only works on the crown but again if you start early enough it works towards the front a bit too.So apply it to my crown and spread it forward to the front. The down side is at first I was getting heart palpitations a little dizziness. I opted for once a day instead of 2x a day. Side effects stopped the next day.Now I am using 2x a day with no side effects it took about 6 months to get my body used to it. I did notice a little weight gain kind of like water retention I see it in my face sometimes but it comes and goes .It is still worth it I am 56 and have plenty of hair for a guy my age.Another thing to be aware of get yourself up a few minutes earlier because when you put this in your hair you apply it to the thin areas and this looks like wet hair on your head and show more scalp until it dries in about 20-30 minutes and then is normal looking again. The key is to find the dose that works for you we are all a little different so start with what it says on the box and work from there good luck . I've been using Rogaine for a few weeks, probably not enough time to see new hair growth.  But my hair is no longer falling out!  Before trying Rogaine I was alarmed at the amount of hair that I had to clean out of my brush routinely.  No more!  That is enough for me to give it 5 stars.  I couldn't give it 5 stars on value for money because like everything else that many people need, it is expensive because you have to use it forever.  But most of their competitor's products cost even more.  So....",2,4,-2

however,"No-Rinse Shampoo, 16 fl oz - Leaves Hair Fresh, Clean and Odor-Free","works quite well for intended use, definitely better than aerosol varieties and a little better than the spray ons. I remember seeing a video years ago about this well it came in handy this week my boyfriend had ear surgery and can’t get his incision wet but needed to wash his hair so as a in between wash I used this and worked like a charm. Good product I had surgery on my face and incisions along hairline. I could not get my face wet for 2 weeks. This shampoo was a true lifesaver!  I used as directed and blew my hair dry and it looked great. I have health issues & skin issues so washing my hair with regular shampoo does a number on my scalp & causes a lot of pain. This rinseless shampoo is great in between washing with regular shampoo. It does not p leave a residue, my hair feels soft, smell & looks great. Price is very reasonable too. I use this for my mom with Alzheimer's and works great. Out of curiosity, I tried it on myself. As I have thicker hair, I wasn't as impressed. I possibly needed to use a lot more. I am happy with the product though as it was purchased to use on my mother with her shorter, thinner, hair. I use this on myself & my dogs. It's great! We love it. Works okay i guess. Maybe better than a lake. For a head of full hair you only get like 2 uses. FYI. I was expecting more but i think that's just how the product is for that camping convenience.",1,4,-3

They are super precise and sharp - i use them to cut my husband’s hair and love how easily it cuts through the hair. Theyve been holding up well over the past year and still cutting strong Wow these are sharp and easy to maneuver. These scissors work great. I had to replace my scissors because they were old and dull. These feel balanced and very smooth. Fits my hand perfect. Nice and sharp. Recommended. I'm not a professional. Living where I live I have to cut and color my own hair because we are not paying 400.00 bucks every 8 weeks for a hair job. I think these are decent. I used them to cut my bangs. They get the job done. In July, I went to the beauty salon  and was surprised by all the people there in the age of covid.  So,  when my hair got long again, I decided to cut  three inches off the ends  by myself.  I saw on You tube how to do it and chose Tweezerman, because I have their excellent eyebrow tweezers. The scissors did not disappoint me,  and I have gotten may complements on  my shorter hair.  So, I did something brave, creative, and money saving, as well as possibly life saving for this senior.  Glad you carried the product.  Thank you, From, Rosemary Julian I have cut my husband hair for years and actually had my hairdresser buy a pair of good scissors to do so!  I've had them probably 25 years and believe it or not, they were rather dull.  Looked online for a pair and kept coming back to Amazon and found these.  Got them yesterday, first haircut was today....  Oh my gosh!  What a difference.  They are wonderful and are actually made in Germany, exactly like my old ones.  You will NOT be disappointed with these scissors! This review was not solicited and I am not getting anything for it and I rarely do reviews! :-) These shears are quite excellent:I had a previous pair of Tweezermans that I loved, but they finally wore out, so I ordered these.  These are even better, with a micro-serration along the blade edge that locks hairs into place as the blades close.  As a result, these cut hair at the exact angle and length you intended, instead of shoving hair along the blade before cutting it.  It's quite effective.The blades are perfectly angled against one another, and they stay that way for the whole length of the cut, so no matter what part of the blades you're using---near the tip or the pivot---they cut equally well.  They're also comfortable, and of a very nice size.  (They're also very sharp:  a guest trimming her own bangs accidentally snipped her finger open with these, so be careful!)If you're looking for something to trim beard hair, bangs or even give whole haircuts at home, these should make you happy.  Pro stylists probably need much fancier and more expensive shears, and if I were a pro, I probably would too---but for the rest of us, these are fantastic for home trimming. I bought these for trimming my bangs.  They are quite sharp and cut easily.  The best compliment I can give them is that my hairstylist commended me on the job I did maintaining my bangs between trims, whereas she was not too thrilled with the job I did with my old scissors.  (I believe they were Revlon, purchased from the drugstore.)Please keep in mind that the blade is quite small.  I don't think the measurements in the product description are as straightforward as they could be; the blade measures 2"".  The full length from the end of the handle to the tip of the blade is about 5"".  I've added a photo to show the scale.These scissors are identical to",2,5,-3

donut fit head without big small hair spray shorter strand expected layered hair,"Soft 'N Style Hair Donut Black, 0.005 Ounce","I bought this item from eCompleteStore here at Amazon.The item was in good condition, as expected, and seems to be good quality. It does not smell at all, as others have mentioned.If you have never used one of these before, watch a few videos on YouTube first. That's what I did and it helped a lot. Some videos are better than others and even some videos for ""sock buns"" were extremely helpful.This donut is so easy to use, once you get the hang of it and it makes a great bun every time, whether you like them a little messy or totally perfect.My hair is down to my waist, but is not very thick. This donut works great for me. It adds a little fullness to my buns.To use it, you first put your hair into a ponytail at the height that you would want the bun. Then, take the donut as if it is ponytail holder and put it around the ponytail and then slide the donut down to the end of the ponytail, wrap about an inch or two of the hair around one side of the donut and roll the donut up onto your hair. As you roll it, the hair will wrap around, making the bun. By ""roll"" it, I mean as if you're turning the donut inside out. The YouTube videos will be much more helpful than any written review. They definitely helped me! When I first read how to use these, it didn't make sense, but after watching the videos, I was a pro :)I've used this same donut several times now and am pretty hard on it, and it is holding up well. It doesn't stretch out or fall apart. I have never owned or used a product that I really thought deserved to be called Fool-proof. This Is It.I am hair disabled. I am so very bad at styling my own hair that some time ago I decided to cut my losses, and invest my energy in more productive pursuits. As such, I can build you a doghouse, but my hair will look like a bird's nest while I do it. This little gadget has changed my life. I know that sounds really hyperbolic, but it's true.I have very long hair and it's heavy, heavy. A pony tail is my only hair trick (pathetic) but within a half hour of wearing one the weight of it kills me! Enter the hair donut. All you have to do - no really - ALL YOU HAVE TO DO to have a deliberate hairstyle is:Put your hair in a pony tail.Put the donut around the pony tail.Move the donut as close to the loose end of your pony tail as possible.Take the hairs that poke through the donut hole and roll them over the edge of the donut.Holding the loose ends of hair against the donut's outer side, ROLL the donut down your pony tail toward your head.Once you get down to your head, tuck tuck tuck any loose pieces.Done.Holy buckets, I am not kidding you're done. You look great and not at all like a person who can't style their own hair at 33 years old. You might even get compliments.In fact, that is the only down-side to this little gem: people will want to know how you get your hair to look so pretty in that ballerina bun! Try your best to come up with a gracious Thank you. Do not let your jaw hit the floor because strangers who are being nice don't know how to work with that response. Trust me, just say Thanks. Say, It's really easy, get a donut! This works SO much better than a rolled up sock in my hair. My hair is extremely fine and silky. It won't hold curls or even a normal ponytail very well, and it comes down to the middle of my back. This donut made a good size bun for my hair/head but I am into the trendy larger buns (I am a junior in college and got tons of compliments on the bun!) and I have long hair. When I used a sock to roll the bun it took several tries because my hair just kept slipping everywhere, and the sock looked floppy and didn't sit very tight on my head. The donut material, on the other hand, gripped my hair while I was rolling so I got a beautiful bun the first time, with my hair evenly distributed all around the rung! I put 4 bobby pins in just to be safe but it felt nice and secure. I've only used it about 4 times total and it hasn't shown any signs of wear and tear or stretching or anything so here's hoping it lasts! It's true it doesn't come with instructions but there are tons of tutorials online. I put my hair in a high pony and put the ponytail through the middle of the donut. I then slide the donut up to the end ponytail with about 4 inches (varies depending on if you have layers) coming out the top and my hands holding the donut/hair tight up above my head. I spread the four inches aroung the donut then start rolling the donut down, holding the hair semi taut as I go. I roll until I think I'm done then do one more roll, and spread out the hair if necessary. Then I put another hair elastic around my beautiful bun and maybe some pins. It's hard to explain in writing but look it up on Youtube! And definitely use a donut instead of a sock to get a perfectly round voluptuous bun! My sister got me into ""sock buns"" a few weeks ago and though I loved the idea of it, the socks just didn't hold very well. This hair donut however, is awesome. It's made of this grippy-meshy material that does a much better job of 'grabbing"" my hair. I still had to practice before I was able to make 'perfect buns' - but it was well worth it.The trick for me was to:1) NOT look in the mirror because that always messed me up for some reason2) Roll the donut down while making sure to push my hair in the donut to keep it tight3) NOT adjust it while rolling it down - I did this at the end4) Keep rolling when I thought I was done rolling, I rolled it once more5) THEN I would adjust my hair and bring the gap closed...sometimes I need a bobby pin or twoIf my hair acts up, I sometimes run my hand under some water and pull down on my pony tail to lightly wet my hair - this isn't always needed when my hair decides it wants to behave!I finish the look off with a head band most times.This is a great look when I only want to spend a few minutes on my hair.",4,5,-1

I keep it on for 2-5 minutes a few days a week  and it works wonders. My favorite  brand,makes my hair soft without the heavy feeling like other conditioners! I keep coming back to this conditioner.  It’s a staple. I have been using this for some time now.  I have a lot of naturally curly hair..and nothing...NOTHING cuts through the snarls like this.  My hair feels great not limp, it is yummy and smells great too... All this and no yucky chemicals... Overall I like this  product. I have curly highlighted hair and it provides good conditioning with out weighing it down. I also like that it is all natural with no sulfates or silicones. My hair love this stuff and it provides lost of slip.  Usually when I do a protein treatment my hair is dry and I have to be sure I apply lots and lots of moisture.  When I use GPB there is no need to go overboard.  It lives my hair moisturized. Just received today, haven’t used it yet. The shampoo bottle felt light. I put it in the sunlight, marked the bottle, the dot, wear it was filled to. It was completely sealed I really like this condition it makes my 3a-3b hair soft and manageable. My daughters like it also I have not tryied the shampoo yet. but will soon.",1,5,-4

The first 3 pictures are after1st week of use the next three are after the 2nd week and the last three were after a month. It says for women not to use it but my hairdresser has several clients who have with success. I took a medication for arthritis pain and my hair started falling out. I have fine hair but a ton of it. It became so thin. I know it will take 9 months before I have that thickness back, but at least now I am hopeful! I will continue to update for those of you who want to see how it works. I am also doing an oil mask one time a week with castor oil, lavender and olive oils and taking an extra Biotin gummy everyday. Works but only in cradlecap area and rather thin hair.  Works well to thicken thin hair Llevo 6 meses usándolo, y puedo ver que funciona, no es  milagroso, pero con paciencia y constancia se logra ver que funciona Llego rapidisimo. Todo en orden. Muchas gracias It is working. Just 2 months and great resultsThank you God for this treatment UPDATE June 2013 -I just bought another year's supply.  I also have used a great product to rid DHT from my hair. I have used other products but surely as good as regain. I am a 55 year old woman. I have noticed over the last few years, that my hairline has been thinning out. I read the reviews of this product, and compared, the men vs women, formula. I opted to try the men's formula. I have been using this product, for two months, and only once a day, in the mornings. I did not want to try it twice a day, in fear that I might grow facial hair, because of the strength of the formula, because it's meant for men, not for a woman. I have noticed a noticeable improvement, in my hairline, with baby hair sprouting out, and also my hair seems to be thicker. My 24 year old daughter, even remarked the other day, that she noticed my hairline becoming thicker. I also noticed, I have not shed as much hair on my pillow at night. or on my clothes, and in the shower. My hair is shoulder length, and I used to get many compliments, on how beautiful my hair was. I will never achieve the hair I wish to have, in my younger years, but I wish to keep as much of my hair as possible, as I age. I have not had any itching problems, or rashes while using this product. I have decided, to start to use this product twice a day starting today, to see if I can see more improvement. I have to say, I am really satisfied with this product, and to have a year supply, at a reasonable price, is a plus for my budget. I will post a update soon, after I have used this product twice a day. I do read reviews on any product, I purchase, and I hope my review will help someone, to decide if this is the right product/purchase for them.**UPDATE** 12/21/2015It still continues to work, since my last review in October 2015. My hair is noticeable thicker with new growth, and hardly no shedding. Of course, it isn't the same hair that I used to have, when I was younger, but it's 90% hair improvement, before I purchased this product. in August 2015. I have been using it for 4 months, and I would highly recommend this product. It may not work for everyone, but it has worked for me. I have read the reviews of others, the majority of users have seen results, like I have, and there has unfortunately been others, with hardly, or no results. I will purchase this product again, once I run out. I hope anyone, that has read my review, has in some way helped them in a positive way:) If anyone does try it, I hope they see some improvement, and that it has worked for them, as it has for me.",3,2,1

I have very thin hair. Just combing it after a shower was useless, because it never stayed in place, and the least wind made it blow in all directions. For decades I used to have to use hair spray to hold it in place. This looked OK until... any big wind came up and blew it out of place ONCE, or I accidently hit/ran into something that dislodged my hair. Then the look was gone. It refused to go back in place until I got home or back to work and could re-spray it. The alcohol in the spray also made my scalp scale up and itch.Then one day... I had just washed my hair, and had not put in hairspray yet, and I went to the barber and after the haircut he asked me if I wanted to try Crew Pomade. I was skeptical, but at that moment, for some reason, I said sure, I will give it a try. I was amazed my hair actually acted like I had thick hair! It actually stayed in place when I combed it, and looked pretty natural (and as a bit of a bonus it made some of my gray hair look a bit more of my original color). I didn't have to use the hair spray any more until I showered again and washed it all out, and I have to put it back on (The amount takes a few times to know how much to put on). But no more worry about wind, (or getting hair knocked when I get in the car and the sun visor hits it unexpectedly...) If it get out of place, just comb it again, and you're as good as new!(As a note: One thing that confuses me is sometimes I get a new container and inside it looks like the lighter color and consistency of say Vaseline, and other times I open a new one and it looks like a dark brownish clear thick jel. They both seem to work the same but I don't understand why the difference.)But for me, I can say it is one of the few products I have EVER used, that I can say it literally changed my life! Expensive and it doesn’t work well would be ok for short hair Easy to use Update: Since I wrote this, I've changed how I do things. Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray). I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look. For me, that shinier look is nice if I'm going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.I blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair. I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it's super easy to get that messy but controlled look. I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.I decided to leave the rest of my original review below. Funny how the process changes over time! Experiment and have fun, but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it's harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn't smell as good).********************************************Original ReviewI've used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great. They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive. The hard part is figuring out...what product is good for what hair?I've gone from very short guy hair, to longer guy hair...and as I've done that, the American Crew product that I prefer has changed.With my hair really short, I was using their ""classic wax,"" which they no longer make. I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well. Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...little spike in the front. Another product I was using with my short hair was TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax. That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works. For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well. As your hair gets drier though, two things happen. The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.So as I grew my hair out...the Fiber began to work less well. I had a lot more hair, and because it's a ""higher hold,"" it actually started to weigh my hair down. Spiking up hair that's only an inch or two long worked fine...but as my hair got to 3+ inches, it would start to fall over. And the Fiber is fairly sticky...so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn't want to stay up.Now I will FINALLY talk about the Pomade!I had to move to a ""lower hold"" product...and I wasn't used to this at first. I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn't give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine). I wanted a little more spike and ""verticalness"" to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more. I've started using a blow dryer to ""train"" my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%). Now the pomade has much more hold!The other product I've been using is the Forming Cream. It's similar to the pomade...but a little less shiny. It has worked well in my longer hair, and like I said before...to get any hold, I need my hair drier.You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like. But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first. Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction. For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair. For longer hair, use the low hold products with drier hair. Performs as advertised.  A little bit goes a long way. It works as it should, but why does it smell like the cat litter box?",5,2,3

I remember the big banana clips from the 80's and sported that style for years. As others have said, these are nothing like the old-school banana clips. The plastic is flimsy, brittle, and inflexible and these are only 5 inches long. But at a cost of less than 3 bucks for 4 clips , what do you expect? These work well for my thin, fine, curly hair. They stay put without sliding around and I'm able to pull layers of my hair through from top to bottom and add some fluff and volume to my style. They are extremely comfortable - no pulling or pinching and they're small and flat enough that I can actually sleep in these and feel like I have nothing in my hair - like wearing a loose hair tie. For the price, they are worth trying and I will definitely be ordering more. If you have thin curly hair, you may find these work great for you too! They are not very big. I have longer hair but it is not very thick. I use these if I have curled the ends and used some product on my hair to add volume. I give my hair a little tease just to give the clip something to hold onto. It isn't the 80's look but it is super cute!! Well worth the couple of dollars I spent to try them. After searching in stores for a clip like this, I was very excited to find this on amazon. I think the clips are a cute way to keep your hair out of your eyes and face as an alternative to a pony tail or bun. The clip gathers your hair into a waterfall kind of look instead of a straight pony tail - sounds weird but its the only way I can think of to describe it. You can wear the clip any way you want - in the back of your head, on the side (for a more elegant look), or even on top of your head if you so desire. However, although I like the look, I stopped wearing the clips after a couple of times because they really do not do a good job of keeping my hair in, I have to constantly re-put in the clip, which gets annoying. I have pretty thick hair, so I imagine that someone with thinner, slicker hair would have even more of a problem with this. Overall, a good, cute clip if you don't mind constantly re-doing your hairdo and/or putting in a lot of bobby pins to keep it in place. These are the perfect size and hold for fine hair. The teeth are smaller too, which holds fine hair in place. I used to wear larger ones when my Hair was thicker but nowdays it's fine and these are perfect. I have extremely thick hair. Naturally wavy. I wear my hair up to sleep every night and half way through my workday I usually whipIt up on top of my head. These clips will hold for a little bit but my hair is almost all the way out by the time I wake up. Will definitely be look for something sturdier to hold my hair up while I sleep. Okay, so I never grew into my adult hair and still have extremely baby fine fair. Like others have mentioned; these clips ARE NOT anything likes them ones from the 80s/90s.  They are tiny and extremely junky. The just barely work on my baby fine hair so I would certainly not recommend these for anyone who has a decent amount of hair because they will not work at all. I would recommend you look elsewhere if you are expecting anything resembling old school banana clips. 4 came in pack, all different colors. I have thick hair and it didnt stretch all the way around my hair. When I used it for half my hair it worked okay. I was worried it was going to pop off and took it off after an hour though. Maybe it would work better for someone with thinner hair. I was a young teenage girl in 80s when banana clips were popular.  I bought because I'm sick of my hair blowing in my face (eyes, nose, mouth) on a windy day.  My hair is fine (but a lot of it) so I needed the comb teeth to be close together.  They stay in better than the wider teeth offered by competitor maker.  However, 5"" is too short and the plastic is so cheap compare to what a ""classic"" should be.  I'm not wearing these because of how cheaply made.  Hopefully they are recyclable.",1,4,-3

I color my hair light ash brown (I'm naturally light brown, with about 30% gray), and I use a highlighting kit on top of that.  Without adding UnRed to my mixtures, my hair always ends up pretty orange.  I've never had success just adding UnRed to my shampoo or conditioner, or even applying it straight to my hair.  That's never worked for me.  Perhaps on a blonde it would work, but on a darker-haired girl, I need the more powerful chemical processes created by the hair color kits to actually have the UrRed take effect.But, the real reason I'm writing this review is to share about Mrs. Stewart's Bluing (which I also get on Amazon).  It's the same stuff elderly women have used in the past to rinse their white hair in to keep it from looking dull or discolored.  I've heard it's where the term ""blue hair"" (used to describe elderly ladies) came from.Anyway, if you know anything about the color wheel, blue is the opposite of orange, so by rinsing orange-tinged hair in blue water (made by mixing Mrs. Stewart's Bluing in water), any remaining orange that's not taken care of by the UnRed is really neutralized.  As anyone who colors hair lighter shades of brown knows, the orange is REALLY hard to prevent.  UnRed is my first line of defense, but on top of that, Mrs. Stewart's Bluing is my life-saver.There are two ways I use it.  First, I mix Mrs. Stewart's Bluing with my favorite conditioner to make my own special anti-orange conditioner (I make my conditioner about the color of a blueberry).  And second, I fill my bathroom sink with water and add the Bluing, and after each shower and I do a final rinse of my hair in that blue water.  It doesn't take out 100% of the orange, but it helps A LOT.  I do have to be careful, as there have been a couple times that I've made my water a little TOO blue and my hair has ended up a tad greenish-gray.  It's not a big deal though, as it comes out at the next shampoo - just give your hair an extra rub between your palms to help get the unwanted blue out.You'll definitely need to experiment with how much Bluing to put in the rinse water.  I would recommend starting out by making your water at least the color of the blue hospital signs you see on the road, and go from there.  Sometimes I make my water a very deep dark blue.  The lighter, and the more damaged your hair, probably the less blue you'll need.  I'm not very scientific about it.  I just give the bottle one or two big squeezes into the sink of water.  Oh, and be sure to use an old (or dark) towel to dry your hair, as the rinse water will leave temporary blue stains on it.I hope this helps someone the way it has helped me! Works Exactly how it's supposed to I have purchased this product many times before in the packet size. This was my first time purchasing the bottle. Since I still had some packets, I did not use the bottle until unfortunately the return window had closed. The problem was that the stopper is defective and it does not screw on properly. As a result the liquid comes out from the sides of the stopper. Very messy. Hope the second bottle that I purchased at the same time does not have this problem. This didn't really work for me but I think that is because I didn't understand how to use or what it's supposed to help with.  I do wish it had clearer instructions.  Basically I was using it because I was going from dyed red hair to blonde.  I bleached my hair to a sort of orange and tried to use this with permanent dye to cover the orange up.  But that's not how this product works.  I believe this product is meant to be used with any color dye to keep it from pulling too warm.  That seems to be a problem for some people when using golden based dyes or even ash dyes, so this product makes the ash (green) more prominent.By the way, just in case anyone might be reading this and might make the same mistake I did, what you really should do to go blonde is bleach your hair at least to a yellow color and then dye with a semi-perm blonde (you don't need to put yourself through the damage of a perm color if you're just going darker because you don't need the lift), unless you're going platinum in which case you will bleach to a pale yellow and then use a toner. It helps tone down red, but it does not completely eliminate it. I have dark ash-blonde hair and after seeing my first grey a few months back, I made the slight mistake of using a box dye on my whole head. Unfortunately the dye put red tones in my hair, which means that even though I have not seen a grey since I am still dying my hair every 6 weeks because the roots don't match. Adding this stuff to my boxed dye did minimize the red tones quite a bit. My roots are not a perfect match, but the red is subtle enough that I think I might be able to stop dying it and test my luck as it grows out (crossing my fingers for no more grey hairs!). Be warned that it looks REALLY scary when you put the dye in after this is added; the dye looks black and super wet. I was so afraid my hair was going to be black but it rinsed out to be pretty close to my natural color. If I dye my hair again in the future I will plan to use more Unred to see if I get better results. It didn't prevent the red from coming out. It does get the red out... After bleaching 3 years of black out my naturally blonde hair I've been left with unsightly, returning orange/red tones. My hair is damaged enough so I limit my use of dyes/toners (until my hair has grown out)... I actually mix about 30 drops into deep conditioner (not the bottle just what I intend on using at that time) and slather it into my hair and let it sit for as long as I can (since my hair is damaged lol) Seems to do the trick. For my hair though, the results do not last long... Orange tones return to my hair very quickly. Other people may have better success depending on their hair though, of course.It did take me a few times to learn how much to use... I wasn't using enough initially. So if you are not getting results try mixing in more to your dye or conditioner.I think they sell a bigger bottle too, don't quote me lol",1,2,-1

hope revlon improves product,"REVLON 1200W Style, Curl, and Volumize Hot Air Kit, 3 Piece Set","It works well and is a very reasonable price.  It has a decent length swivel cord and seems to be well-built.  It has multiple settings - high heat/high power, low heat/low power and cool/high power.  Unlike most of the competitors, the smaller brushes work on medium and shorter hair.  It can get quite warm on high heat so use caution around ears, etc.  Even if you don't use it as a styling tool, it works very well as a blow dryer and since it is lightweight and easy to hold, it would be great for someone with mobility issues or weakness.  My only complaint, is that I wish the low heat setting wasn't also low power but otherwise, it is a great value and I would recommend this. I have flat, straight, THICK, hair. It's a bad combo sometimes because it won't usually behave as though it has body even though I have a lot of hair. This tool works great to provide a good lift at my roots. I use a root lifting mouse/spray and then I will partially dry my hair up until it's just a bit damp still. I then use this tool to curl/dry at the roots at the same time. CAUTION: the highest heat setting is HOT! That's to be expected but the temp control of this tool definitely 'understood the assignment'. LOL! I mainly use it on low heat and then do a cool blast at the end to cool my hair/scalp down. I use a beach wave spray to add a bit of texture and light hold to my hair AFTER using this tool, and then finish it with a good holding spray. I have no complains so far! Item itself seems great. However, once I took it out of package I knew it was too large for my small hands and I have arthritis. I never used it. I did turn on dryer and it seems to have great power. Amazon does not back this product for return, so now I have to deal with Revlon, hope that goes smoothly. Just inconvenient, nowhere here did I read that return was not guaranteed thru Amazon or I might not have taken a chance. I am extremely bad at styling my hair. My hair is short (an inch or so above my shoulders), and I have a LOT of it. I'm pretty clumsy, and I have a lot of trouble figuring out how to coordinate both hands to do a proper blow out on my entire head. I bought this product in hopes it would be a little easier than the traditional hair dryer + round brush combo.It IS easier, but still not fool proof for me. But I blame that more on me than the actual product. It does exactly what it needs to do, my hands are just incompetent.My only true complaint is that it's loud. I know any dryer is going to be loud, but I have trouble using any mode but 'low' for an extended period of time.I've had this product for ~6 months now and have travelled extensively with it and everything is still intact.Overall for the price I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought this hot air styling brush kit to replace a similar one that broke after many years of use (I dropped it on a tile floor one too many times). So far, it's been as good for styling my short, fine hair, that has a slight wave in it which tends to flip the wrong way unless I style it - which annoys me, as my old one did. I hope it lasts me as long too. I had my old one just over 10 years! The old one still turned on, even after drop #4, but the handle where it met the electrical cord was too just broken to make it safe to use anymore. No amount of duct tape around it would convince me otherwise.I don't actually bother styling my hair most days, since I work from home, but when I want my hair to have more style, I use this, with a light, natural styling gel, and been happy 90% of the time with the results. The only times I haven't been happy is when I'm in a humid area. Humidity makes my hair go nuts; either it loses all the style I spent time putting in by drooping and going flat, or it gets super wavy, curly, and/or frizzy, which drives me crazy too (I hate having my hair in my face), so I end up using a hair tie and clips to hold it back from my face, and/or I wear a hat. I don't use fixative type hair products due to the toxicity of most of them. I have asthma, very sensitive skin and a sensitive scalp. I breakout from most styling products. Also, most fragrances in most products and sprays, tend to trigger my allergies and/or asthma. Using just this brush and the natural styling gel are really my only options, and work fine, mostly. I deal with it if they don't. They work well together when I'm home in Colorado, most of the time. Humidity here does the same thing as it does anywhere else to my hair though, but it's rarely very humid here.I want to warn everyone, as with all styling brushes and blow dryers, the Revlon Hot Air Brush does get HOT while using it. Not so much the handle where you hold it most of the time, but all the metal parts do, and so does the handle near the styling attachments area. So, please be careful when changing out the attachments, cleaning the brushes, putting it away, or packing it after use. Some parts retain heat for a while. Give them time to cool down, 5-10 minutes, or use something to protect your fingers/hands if you need to change attachments while using it.I also just can't stress these next things enough:1. DO NOT use it near a sink or bathtub with water in it. If you accidentally drop it into water while it's plugged into a wall outlet, you could electrocute yourself, and/or start a fire. It'll be ruined too. Water and most motorized things do not go well together. it's not a waterproof item.2. ALWAYS, when you finish using it, unplug it and leave it on a counter, far away from curious little ones if they are of concern, or hang it up, to allow it to cool off, before you put it away or pack it in a suitcase! The risks of burning someone or something, and/or starting a fire, are real. I scorched a t-shirt slightly, when I went to pack it in my suitcase, before giving it enough time to cool off first. I had wrapped the t-shirt around the handle part, to cushion it in my suitcase. When I unpacked it at home to put it away, I found the scorch mark on the shirt. Lesson learned. Luckily, it wasn't one of my new t-shirts I ruined.3. DO NOT leave it plugged into a wall outlet, even if it's not turned on or hot, and forget about it. Power spikes can damage it, and cause an electrical fire if it sparks. Also, you don't want anything else happening either, such as a young child getting ahold of it.So, yes, I recommend you try the Revlon Hot Air Brush Kit. If you don't like it, return it before the 30 days return period. Just be smart about using it and storing it. If it lasts me 5-10 years, I'll be happy. This dryer styler dried my hair perfectly and gives my hair body.  I read the reviews and many mentioned that this product gets hot.  Yes it does.  So do other dryers, curling irons, etc.  That's how they work.  That's why they have different settings.  If I am not careful, I burn myself on my curling iron, frequently.  Common sense tells you that it's hot, be careful.  I think I will keep mine.  I like the fact that this one has bristles instead of plastic nubs. This product is the best I found so far in price, size of barrel brush, the handle is not too big for small hands and strength of drying power sufficient pretty strong. Still trying to master the technique of styling.  So far so good. This is the BEST way I have ever done my hair!  I’ve been using hot or dryers for years, love this one because it’s 1200 watts, lots of drying power.  I’ve found that it’s super important to check the watts in a dryer like this - most similar products are a lot less wattage.  I have bought this many times over the years,  Please continue making this !!",1,4,-3

Even my toddler commented on the scent. It doesn't really work on my loose wavy hair though; makes my hair super dry and frizzy.But I mean, the smell is worth all four stars. I might repurchase. I bought this as well as the the Giovanni Deep Moisture Conditioner for my husband.  He really liked it so I decided to try it and wow what a positive difference.  I was using the popular Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo and also their Conditioner but they re-formulated the conditioner and it has never been the same which in turn caused me to get a scalp irritation.  Now that I'm using Giovanni my hair (and scalp) feel cleaner, more moisturized, and my fine hair has more body. This is my favorite natural shampoo.  It has no sulfates and is full of things that come from nature.  Usually a shampoo has the chemical components as the top ingredients and down at the bottom of the list might be a few natural oils etc.  This one is the complete opposite!  I love that it is made without animal testing, too.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of its price.  I use very little so a bottle lasts a long time. My Asian, normally smooth silky hair turned explosive fly-away haywires after the first use of this set of shampoo & conditioner.  My cartoon-ish shock face gave us a good laughter, but I never used them again for hair...  Unable to return, I may try to use for washing wool sweater, but will have to test on something small first. I'm always skeptical about hair products.  I've tried shampoos that are supposed to do everything from curl to de-frizz to shine to soften and have never noticed a real difference with my hair.  Not this time!  After two or three washes with Giovanni Smooth as Silk, my hair looked so much shinier that I felt like a shampoo commercial model.  I actually stood in front of the mirror tossing my hair around and sultrily whispering ""Because you're worth it.""  I never expected such drastic results from a vegan shampoo; Giovanni is 100% worth the price. I love this shampoo.  Absolutely love it!!! It made my hair super super soft.  Since I still had a lot of other conditioners, I did not other this brand's conditioner yet.  From the experience with the shampoo.  I am planning to get the conditioner. So far, I absolutely love this shampoo and the hello hydration shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1.  Imagine this shampoo gives me the same result as a 2 in 1.  That's amazing.  Truly smooth as silk.  By the way, I have 4a/4b hair. Great for my 3B/3C ethnic / blasian hair!  The difference between this shampoo and others is great!  This is the only shampoo that I've used that keeps hair feeling great and not stringy like other shampoos do. I can tell that it leaves my hair healthy by the way it holds my hair waves and curls. Absolutely love the smell of this shampoo too. Best ever! I started using this product last year. It left my hair clean and was gentle on my hair. However, the last bottle I purchased and used seems to leave my hair stressed out. It just does not feel the same. I am thinking that either something changed in the formula (freaking product improvements that always seem to be for the worse) or I need to take a break from it.",1,4,-3

I like it because the powder allows you to make a small amount vs. having to waste an entire tube of the other stuff. Be careful because it is darker than you think if applying low lights to light or gray hair. Primera vez que la uso no soy profesional pero me encanto la deje como 5 minutos por miedo pero guaaaaauuuu le doy un 100 por que me pinto mis cejas con pomada por que no tengo muchas pero me es incómodo por q hay que estar cada rato pintándotelas y eso me molesta lo recomiendo al maximoooo It took me a long time to figure out which color to purchase. I have highlighted hair and my base color is dark brown. Thanks to all the warnings in the reviews, I went with a lighter color because 1) an overwhelming majority said that the color is darker than pictured 2) since this is deposit only (which means it can't lighten your hair, but only take you darker/cover greys), I didn't want it to darken my base or my highlights (even though I was somewhat careful to not get it on my highlighted hair). So with that background, I went with the ""light chestnut"" color. My greys are scattered and there aren't a ton of them, but they're in very visible areas (I'd say I'm about 15% grey). I mixed about half the bottle directly in the plastic container it came with (this ended up being too much, so heads up folks, if you're 15-20% grey, you don't need to use that much). I love that you don't have to use the whole box by the way! Anyway, back to the process...Since I have these scattered greys, I took a latisse brush (which is basically a very small paint brush) and used that to apply the color. It took me longer to apply the color since it was such a small brush, but also allowed for more precision. The chemical smell was pretty overwhelming. I didn't expect that. Once I finished (took me about 20 minutes to go through all my greys with this tiny little brush), I let it sit for another 30 minutes, which is longer than recommended. I did that anyway because a) My greys tent to be stubborn and b) I wanted to make sure that the last painted areas would get the needed time. I washed it out (no mess, didn't stain my tub or face at all and I didn't use vaseline on my forehead as recommended. I did have a few specks of it in my bathroom sink so try to keep the area covered, even though you can clean it off), and voila every single grey strand was gone. I was amazed. My non-greys did turn about 1-2 shades darker, which I was not happy about, however with every wash, it seems to be getting better, which is a relief. It was my own fault for leaving it longer than needed (they did warn you on the box that the color would go darker if left on too long). Here's my takeaway from the whole experience broken down into pros and cons.Pros: it's not pricey, didn't damage my hair, hair was left shiny with dimensional color, it's deposit only, greys weren't as dark as the rest of my hair giving a nice subtle highlighted look, you don't have to use the whole box,and it takes up very little room when storing.Cons: strong chemical smell (gave me a bit of a headache), it's a learning curve to figure out the right color, colors tend to run darkEdit: You can also use a mascara brush to cover small bits of hair. Works pretty well. Also, I am still using the lightest color (light chestnut) on my dark brown hair and by the time it covers the greys, my hair ends up darker than my base (comes out very very dark brown). I didn't think it was that obvious until others pointed it out in my hair. I am docking a star for that.  They should really come out with lighter shades and it's also pretty insane that I have to go so many shades down from my actual hair color. Excelente producto Will purchase again",1,5,-4

Protein Balancing Conditioner, 16-Ounce Bottle","Within the last year, I have been trying to clean up my beauty product routine. I have been switching to more natural products both with my hair regime and my face regime. I found a wonderful website for references, www.GoodGuide.com and that is how I stumbled upon Aubrey Organics. It was highly rated on the site as healthy, environmentally, and societally safe. It was also not astronomically out of my price range so I thought, why not, I will give it a go. I use this conditioner with the Aubrey Organics Camomile Luxurious Volumizing Shampoo (what happened to be available on Amazon Prime) and I must say, it is certainly different from using a cheap brand such as Herbal Essences or Pantene Pro-V which I was switching between. I used this combination for about 3 months or so and the bottles are probably about half full still (I also only have shoulder length hair). They have lasted a good while and that is great to know considering that you are paying more for the product. However, with a higher price tag usually comes a better product and I must say Aubrey Organics does deliver. I love that they have natural products and nothing that is harmful to you or your hair. If you would like to find out how the shampoo worked for me, you can look my review up; in this one I would like to just address the conditioner.I do like the Aubrey Organics conditioner. It is a little harder to work through the hair after washing with their shampoo (see my review for details) and this is why I give it 4 stars. However, if I start from the ends and carefully work my way up while getting the tangles out, I can usually work the conditioner in without it being too painful. After washing the conditioner out, my hair doesn't get that ""squeaky clean"" or silky feeling like it would with a traditional shampoo/conditioner combo, but I am okay with that now because of the results it has given me. After allowing my hair to dry in a towel for a few minutes, I usually just let it air dry the rest of the way. My hair is less frizzy, is shiny, silky, and much more tame. I can DEFINITELY see the difference between my use with Aubrey Organics and other cheap brands. The difference is insane.Overall, I love Aubrey Organics. Because this is my first time ever trying a natural product in the shower, I am new to how it feels. It does take a little getting used to because they don't ""sud"" up in the shower and it makes it slightly difficult to wash while in the shower, but once you are out, there is no issue. It is easy to comb through if needed, but I like just letting it air dry to reveal my natural waves. It's incredible what a difference this shampoo/conditioner combo has made. I would highly recommend Aubrey Organics to anyone who is looking for natural products. They are affordable (especially for organic) and do wonders for your hair; give them a try! A lot of people complain about this product, saying it's not the same as it use to be / not as good as it use to be,,,, that it made their hair dry and break and stuff. But I guess everybody's hair is different and therefore reacts differently to different products because I love this stuff. MY HAIR TEXTURE: I am black with curly/kinky hair that needs a lot of moisture. It curls up when moisturized correctly. Otherwise it'll just be dry and tangled.  I wear it straight during Fall, Winter, and half of Spring.  I wear it natural (no heat) all Summer.I've been using it since around November 2014 (Winter: wearing my hair straight). I wash my hair with Jane Carter Solution shampoo (thinking about switching to something else) and then I use this conditioner.  I do this every other week.  Immediately after I rinse it out (I leave it in for about 5 to 7 min), my hair feels unusually super soft and strong.  After I rinse it, I gently towel dry it a little bit and then put additional moisturizer in it (a concoction I mixed together myself) and then i blow dry it.  My hair feels stronger than normal for about the next 3 days,,,, I guess because the product is still in there and takes a while to completely go away.  Even though this is a protein conditioner, they did a good job of making it very moisturizing as well.  I love it.  But I do understand that everybody's hair is different so you never know until you try it. As far as the smell, I like that too.  Smells good to me :) I have been using Biolage for quite some time now, but as is bound to happen in past experiences...my hair ""gets used"" to a product and stops responding as when I first discovered it!  Fortunately, I just discovered this lovely conditioner!  It is definitely my new favorite and I hope my hair never ""gets used"" to it so that I can use it all the time FOREVER!  The way it softens and conditions is absolutely fabulous and I can't begin to explain the beautiful smell!  When I was putting it on my damp hair I wasn't sure it was going to work since it wasn't heavy and greasy like I'm used to feeling when I put conditioner on my hair...instead, it is smooth and creamy (smells wonderful too) and when applied to my hair I really had to work it in and smooth it to the ends...it took a little effort but as I was pulling it toward the ends it became easier and easier and actually coated my hair very nicely.  I waited about 4 minutes and rinsed.  The rinse was a pleasant surprise since it was easy to remove from my hair without rinsing and rinsing and rinsing!  I could tell it didn't leave a residue but felt soft and swingy.  Since I have naturally curly, frizzy hair I rinse with a cold rinse to seal the cuticle and stop the frizz as my hair dries.  This method worked very well with this conditioner...excellent results!  Just a little note:  I did precede the conditioner with the Aubrey Swimmer's Shampoo (non-lathering...no sulphates)...this works best for my silver-grey hair to keep it silvery and beautiful!  I am a very happy lady with the Aubrey products I'm now using! A pretty good conditoner, especially considering it's all natural. It took a while for my hair to adjust to all natural shampoo and conditioner, but after a couple of months it did finally adjust, and I've found that the Aubrey Organics line of conditioners does a good job of actually detangling my hair, which most all natural conditioners can't seem to do.My only complaint is that I don't like the smell. It's not pretty or feminine smelling. It doesn't have a nice flora or yummy food scent. It smells very masculine. Fortunately the smell doesn't linger too long after rinsing it out.",2,4,-2

Back in college, I used to make beaded bobby pins and I thought I'd like to try again, so I bought these.  (I get a lot of bead subscription boxes and was wanting to branch out from bracelets and necklaces.  Bobby pins are great for beading with beads from subscription boxes because you usually only get a small amount of each bead -- but that's all you need with a bobby pin.)There's not a lot to say about bobby pins.  These are a good compromise between cost and quality.  They are lasting longer for me than if I was using them for updos because they don't have to hold a lot of weight.To bead them, I just choose some beads, get some thin wire (I have some 34 gauge wire that will fit most beads, including some freshwater pearls).  I wrap the wire around the bobby pin, making sure the end of the wire is on top or tucked into a bead so as not to get caught in my hair, string some beads on it, occasionally wrapping again to hold them in place.  Cute, quick hair accessories that can be formal or not, depending on the choice of beads. The Diane 2"" bobby pins are good cheap bobby pins.  They do exactly what they are supposed to do, hold the hair in place.  Unlike some other brands I have bought, the Diane brand are more of a one time use pin.  I have used others that have last many multiple hairdos without stretching and losing their shape.  Once a bobby pin is stretched out, it is unusable.  You do get a large tub of pins so unless you use 10 a day they should last you many months.  They should get my daughter through most of the dance season.I purchase lots of items through Amazon, some I get for free, some I get at a discounted rate, and some I pay full price. I will always disclose if I receive an item for free or a discounted rate. I do a lot of reviews so here is a break down on how I determine my star rating of a product:5 stars – I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!4 stars – I like it, but there are some flaws. Don't we all have flaws? I would purchase again.3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.2 stars – There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.1 star – I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and recommend others to not purchase.If my review was helpful please click the yes button below.  Thank you! I have fine and thin blond hair and always thought bobby pins were a waste of my time because they would slide out so fast leaving me with hair in my face and strange kinks and bends where the pins had been. Then I found a beauty blog that recommended trying a professional brand (she was a professional stylist for many years). Sure enough for a little bit more $, these Diane bobby pins work great. I have tried them to pull back my long bangs with the rest of my hair down and in a side swept bun to keep all my ends tucked in. Both times they stayed in all day. They don't make a light colored pin for blond hair, but I have no problem with the bronze color.One other note, this beauty blogger informed me of something I can't believe I went my whole life without knowing; bobby pins are supposed to be inserted with wavy side toward your head. I don't know if it's silly that I didn't know this already, but I always assumed since the tip of the wavy side points out it would hurt my head to put it against my scalp, it doesn't at all and really holds better that way. I bought these to do an updo for a wedding I was in. Me and 3 other bridesmaids all used these for a hot, humid wedding this past weekend - alone. No other clips, ties, or elastics; just these pins and a bit of hairspray for our updos. I danced all night and marveled that my hair didn't budge. At one point I remarked that my hair was surprisingly still in place and someone literally tried to pull it out, and failed.Today I put my hair up in a bun, again using just these to hold my hair up, with no hairspray. It's now 1:15 and I'm just back from an outdoor workout (it's 85 and humid out) and just needed to adjust one pin. Amazing! I will never buy other bobby pins again.UPDATE: a year later and these are still amazing. I use them constantly. Just used them for another wedding in which there were 40mph winds. Hair didn't move. I can put up my hair (shoulder length, reasonably thick) with 3 pins and it stays all day. I've even gone for a JOG with about 4 of these holding my hair up and was fine. I am a hairdresser and i love these bobby pins. I regularly go on location to do hair for weddings and i am so glad i found this product. They are basic bobby pins and does a pretty good job with blending with blonde hair but what i love so much is the packaging. I love it for many reasons. First it looks professional. Second, it is easy to grab a bobby pin when i need it while doing updos. Last, it doesnt make a mess like other ways bobby pins are packaged. It stays in one container instead of having to pull off pins off a cardboard sheet and have them just laying out on the table.My coworkers use these as well and have loved them for a long time. I recommed this for professionals as well as everyone. Because who wants to continuously lose bobby pins when you can have them in one spot in your bathroom (instead of all over the counter and floor like my bathroom used to be) It's hard to rave about bobby pins but overall, these do work. They blend in well with my brunette hair, even as I bleach it to blonde. It comes in a big plastic tub, which is perfect for storing all of them under the sink. Better than cardboard, which wears, breaks, and then you end up losing the pins or there's no decent way to store them. You get tons of them, so even though I have probably lost dozens by now, the bin is plenty full. I'll probably never need more bobby pins for years! The price is good, they work as well as any other, and they come with a plastic tub for storage. Why would you buy 10 at a time anywhere else?",5,4,1

this to shave my head twice per week. It really, really helps the razor glide smoothly and smells wonderful. Repeat buyer, I am a fan It was OK, probably won’t order again My hair no bad but not I was expecting Use this stuff for shaving the head.Works way better than shaving cream. It isn't very moisturizing. You have to use a lot of it and leave it on for a while. Just not a very good value.Edit: almost 2 years later..Ok so I didn't love this product for myself. My boyfriend's dog was having some issues with scratching herself after bathing (she gets dry skin after bathing). The vet recommended using a mild, coconut conditioner on her after bathing. Guys... this works great. I started using it on my own dog as well. He's never been so soft. They don't itch after baths anymore, they smell clean, and they're much more comfortable. I don't know what else to say. Try this on your dog lol I went to a new salon, scary in the first place. I don't like salons, this was a small town ,one person salon. The owner and operator recommended this product , then used it on my hair after my shampoo, just on towel dried hair ,a marble sized squeeze of this she ran through my hair from the bottom to the top and just left it in there , no rinse out. She combed it through my hair easily , I was in shock because it always hurts my head to comb it after a wash and good conditioning , but with this is was a breeze. I have horrible fine thick wavy hair that tangles when you look at it wrong. I despise washing my hair because it takes forever to comb out with all the tangles and its like pine straw. This magic coconut stuff saved the day. All my life of suffering and finally something that makes my hair so much better and not such a pain. I plan on buying this until I croak or they stop selling it..its great! I've been using it a month and my hair looks calm, shiny , and moist. I am so happy. I got lucky the salon owner wanted me to have good hair and not just sell me some over price stuff like they push in most salons. If your hair is crazy, you really need this, Oh it smells nice , but not over powering. No",5,3,2

It works just as I had hoped. Highly recommended. No spicks, no tearing out hair, no scraping scalp. Manage hair with soft easy strokes, even adds shine. Also fells great on beards and mustaches. Probably the best brush I’ve ever owned! Great for thin hair. The bristles are really soft and smooth and my hair has never looked fuller. I bought this hair brush while on a healthy hair kick.  I have thick, long, fine stranded, color treated hair with a natural wave in it.  Some pieces curl, but most are just waves.  I try to only wash my hair 2 days a week, 3 if I am going out or have a date.  However, my hair gets really oily at the scalp, and beside it looking unkempt, its also just plain annoying.I like this brush because it distributes the natural scalp oils.  Its what it was made to do, IMO.  The first time I used it I noticed how soft the bristles were, I really thought they would feel hard, or the bristles would be scratchy, but its so soft and feels nice going through my hair.  However, I can't just pick it up and brush my hair with it.Because my hair is so thick I have to section it off into 4 or 5 pieces, clip them up and brush them out separately. If I don't, I can't get the bristles through my hair, or at least it feels like the bristles are not actually brushing, they are just sweeping across my hair without going through the strands.  If that makes sense.  This is why I deducted a star from the rating.I generally use this brush once the oil really builds up, before I shower.  This brush will make your hair frizz out if your hair is prone to frizz.  I did experience some static with this initially, but I found that the longer I brushed my hair for (during that session), the static went away.  The main reason for using a 100% boar bristle brush is to distribute oils, it really does make your hair shine.I feel like one of those ladies that brushes their hair for 100 counts every night, but I generally only use this brush a few times a week, and other times just run a comb through my hair, or don't brush it at all. Updated Nov. 2022: Added two pics & repurchased again this year. Bought the original brush in March 2017 and used it for over 5 years. Kept it dry and clean and it held up well. It was such a quality product that I had to buy another one! I passed down the old brush to our new cat who loves this it as much as I did. The bristles are still strong and yet so soft all these years later. Thank you so much to Bass Brushes for making this brush an essential in my life 😍------Original Review------This brush is amazing. Let me start by saying I used to hate brushing my hair. I'm mid 20's, natural blonde with super thin, fragile hair and it always took so long to brush my hair because I really had to be extremely careful or my hair would break too much. Now, I actually look forward to brushing my hair, it seriously feels so luxurious! I'm in love with this brush, I'm not sure how my hair has survived without it. I really can't believe this is the first soft bristle brush I've ever had. I'm a bit sad that I've been using hard plastic bristle brushes for so long. After using this brush, I'll never go back. I am really surprised at the difference it makes; my hair feels softer, sleeker, and the appearance has drastically changed since I switched. I don't have nearly as much damage/breakage as I used to have with my old brushes.This brush is wonderfully made, excellent quality, great craftsmanship. I love the style and feel, so comfortable to hold and to use, the bristles are gentle on my hair and scalp, very soft but firm enough to detangle my thin hair. It's so easy to use and clean, I love it! Would definitely purchase again and will highly recommend, will certainly be shopping with this company again! Here's the deal. There are a lot of negative reviews saying that the brush is falsely advertised because it contains 'wood, wire' and other such bristles. I personally was apprehensive about ordering my brush due to these reviews. Let me lay your fears about that one to rest.The brush comes with a paper tag held on by elastic (says Green in the picture). Inside this tag, Bass advertises that they offer brushes with boar's hair, wood, wire, and a couple of other types of bristles. These types of bristles are FOR OTHER BRUSHES. Bass is simply advertising its other merchandise to you. This is indeed a 100% boar's hair bristle brush, and it says so on the handle.About the brush itself: I have to say that I like this brush. I can tell that it is very effective at bringing my scalp oils further down my hair, thus reducing the appearance of an oily scalp. It is also gentle on my hair, so I don't have to yank it through all of the time. That being said, it is important to clean this brush regularly (every two weeks at the most!), or it will get kinda gross. Overall, I really like this brush, and I wanted to clear up the whole bristle thing! These brushes were recommended to me by my hair stylist. Although there is no scientific study: men should use the natural brushes to prevent male pattern baldness and to look good for your partner(s) as well as for job hygiene performance even for camera. Being in front of the cameras require that every hair be in place and these brushes deliver. The oils in your natural hair are distributed with the natural bristles and especially right out of the steam room, sauna, hot tub or bath let the brush do the work as the hair is dried by nature.",3,5,-2

piece bought mother right size like lot using regularly,"Diane Snap On Magnetic Roller, Purple, 1 3/4""","These are so great! And they arrived quickly. I think these are the largest size you can get for magnetic rollers that come with the snap on clips, which I love. Metal clips, such as required for other rollers, pinch my scalp by pulling little hairs, but these snap on clips don't do that. I get a great curl with these. I put on wet hair, or towel-dried I should say, and wait 3 hours. for them to dry. I do use magnetic rollers without the snap on clips for areas of my hair that the clip-dents would show, such as my bangs and one roller behind them, and front side rollers--4 total I have to use a metal clip on but the rest are all these snap on rollers-a mix of these and one size smaller  I haven't tried sleeping on them. I love them! I threw out all my sticky rollers and I had every size lol. They just  pulled my fine hair out and I can't afford to lose any hair.  Buy these you won't regret it! Rollers are gentle on the hair I gave these a try in my bid to find healthy ways to define the curls in my waist-length, very thick, wavy hair. I hate using curling irons or hair dryers or hot rollers (which never really work on me anyway since my hair is so heavy it would just pull the curl straight down) so I tend to sleep on two braids or twist damp hair around an elastic headband (this works extremely well, by the way. I'll detail it at the bottom). I was hoping to find some easy rollers that could hold the amount of hair that I have and that were comfortable enough to sleep on. These weren't quite as large as I was hoping to find (I wanted a minimum of 2"") but decided to try them anyways.First, I don't understand why they say these are magnetic when they are clearly not. They are simply hard plastic with a hard plastic cover that snaps on through a tight fit rather than any magnetic properties. Even with a tiny bit of hair on the roller, my hair is long enough that it was extremely difficult to get the plastic cover to snap on over it. But I did it after a bit of work and then let my hair sit like that all day on a Saturday. I had been planning on trying to wear them to bed but I noticed the hair was completely dry so I figured I'd see how the curls turned out. They probably would have been semi-okay if my hair didn't get caught up all over the rollers and pull the curls apart in a very frizzy kind of way. My hair was HUGE when it finally came out and definitely not in a good way.I'm sure these rollers are great for people with shorter hair than me. For me, it was just way too time consuming and too uncomfortable to consider trying again. I get amazing results from five minutes of work before going to bed so I'll continue with that.Here's what I found that works:1. Get an elastic headband (I use These rollers really are the best! The smooth finish and snug fit of the clip are great features. Definitely my favorite style. To create texture, I bought them in three different sizes. Bonus: they're affordable and durable!I've tried lots of different kinds of rollers, varieties and results as follows:VELCRO - HORRIBLE, I have fine long hair and it took (seriously) 2 hours for me to get them out of without ripping my hair out of my head !SPONGE - fasteners come loose and they  don't give a consistent controlled curl.TOOTH SNAP ROLLERS - leave ugly kinks.SPIRAL - Great in theory but when they are bent they become bulky and make it hard to put it evenly  I bought them to create a spiral curl and the results were unsatisfactory.BOTTOM LINE: Buy these Diane Snap-On Rollers and forget the rest - you'll be glad you did! I ordered these and was a little concerned when I didnt get a trackink number in my email but they came in only 3 days which was awesome! And this seller has free shipping too. Okay so I am an African American woman with long almost wait length natural hair and I wanted some rollers that would Allow my hair to dry faster than the sponge rollers I had been using/ not cause tangles like the velcro ones either. I love this I used about 30 on my damp almost dry and it dried so soft and bouncy in loose curls! It only took my hair 3 hours to finish drying where as I need either a blow dryer or 10 hours in a sponge set from start to finish.. yes I know, but I have REALLY thick and coily hair. I bought 6 packs but I probably could have gotten away with 5, I'm not complaining though. I went back and bought the pink ones for a tighter curl. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these for my natural hair & I'm sure this will be my new go to style after a hairwash. I bought a few packs of these rollers to replace some velcro ones I'd been using for years to relax my hair at home. (I have shoulder-length, thick, very curly hair, and I use large rollers with perm solution to relax my curl, especially to un-kink my roots.) For my purposes, these snap-on rollers are perfect. They are MUCH easier to use and more effective than the velcro rollers, which required all kinds of clips to stay in (and even then did not stay in very securely). I was able to roll my hair tightly right down to my scalp with these Diane rollers, and they didn't budge even when rinsing out the perm solution under running water. It also only took me 20 minutes to roll my hair with these, whereas the velcro ones used to take me more like 45-60 minutes. These rollers are also easy to rinse up afterward, and the price was right on them. Five stars! These are simply magnetic rollers ( which aren't actually magnetic, just means hair "" sticks"" to them when wet. "")They have the innovation of the little clip on case to hold them on, which makes things easier. They do cause "" dents"", but almost every roller can if not wrapped right, however, this can cause a more pronounced dent because of the clip on thingy.  Eh, it's a trade off. They do what rollers do.",1,5,-4

once and it nicely thinned it.  I haven't yet used it to cut to length but it is very sharp and should work well. My child is 3 and I use this to cut his hair. So much safer than using scissors on a thrashing 3year old. Just be careful around the ears. I use the shortest on the back and sides and the longer one for the top.  good for quick 'clean ups' between cuts I bought this hair cutter to thin out some hair on a wig I bought.  Did the job perfectly, did not cut too much and thinned it out where needed just right.  This cutter was economical and did a good job.  I used to have a razor like this for thinning people's hair when I was a beautician,  and it did better than the one I used at the beauty parlor. Just what i wanted. I have a 14-year-old cat who is no longer taking the bus to care of her fur. She's not grooming herself as well. So she just started to get small mats in her fur she sure had cat so they're not very big but they are there and probably uncomfortable. She does not like being held she does not like being brushed so trying to get those out of her is a pain in the backside. I'm afraid to use scissors because I don't want to accidentally cut her and not just her fur. So I thought these would help.Not so much. I understand that's not what these are actually made for, but for this job there are the best. You have to hold them at such an angle and anything the slightest bit thick it won't touch. Even if I go below the mat it doesn't really want to cut the fur. And she's not going to thick coat. She's a short-haired tabby so it should cut through a fairly easily but it doesn't. It doesn't help that she doesn't want to stand still for it, but even when I can't keep her still this just doesn't do the trick.Maybe if he is still a person's hair, but I'm not sure how you would use it without kind of butchering the person's hair but 🤷‍♀️",3,5,-2

I guess I should have but the difference this stuff made in my naturally long & heavily highlighted hair is incredible. I wasn’t sure what to expect when I first used it. The light, lemon fragrance was refreshing. I lathered up a few times because I wanted to be sure any build up was stripped away. I conditioned with one of my go-tos - Matrix conditioning balm - & my hair has never felt softer or cleaner. I can’t believe a shampoo can make this big of a difference! If you use cheap shampoo or have never clarified your hair you need this to help w build up. Build up causes dullness, heaviness, causes your hair to get dirty sooner after washing and can cause your hair to smell bad. I looooove this, it changed my hair game. After I started using it weekly my hair is shinier, lighter and has more volume. I always have a good hair day after washing w this. Love it liked the fact that it works as advertised. I alternate shampoo brands and types so this is my cleaning shampoo that removes the other products buildup. It was a great replacement product. My hair feels great after using this I recommend this.

I sprinkle on the ends of my hair.  When I’m finished I spray hairspray again. This stuff is a lifesaver and confidence booster for anyone with thinning hair! I would recommend getting 2 and keeping one with the shaker top, and getting the pump on the other one. Exactly as advertised. Thank you Looks very natural and great coverage. The only downside is that if you like touching your hair a lot, your fingers will get powder all over. This is my favorite hair fiber for thinning hair.  It stays for days without a fake problem.  Highly recommend as I have tried several brands. This bottle lasts a long time and I use it maybe three times a week.  Covid thinned my hair in certain places. My wife is so embarrassed about balding part in her hair.  This product covers it well and pleases her.  Easy to apply. I’ve been using this stuff for a couple of years now and I will hardly leave home without it! I have gray hair with enough dark still visible that it matches well. I use the brown color powder.

Buen producto y a buen precio Works great,color matches perfect. It works like lipstick. You need to put something under hair around face to keep it from getting on skin. Also wash off at night to keep off pillow case. It's too dry to stick to hair. Not very easy to use. And the medium brown shade was reddish, which did not blend well with my brown hair. I would not buy again. I didn't like how it look like in me My hair is medium blond. This crayon matches really good.  Goes on good. Works great. I would give this product five stars except for the fact that if you apply the color directly from the tube to your hair there is a risk of the color breaking off from the tube and it goes on a little too heavy for me.  I use a clean mascara brush (you can pick them up free from the beauty counters at most department stores) and without much color exposed from the tube itself, gently rub the mascara brush along the color then apply/sweep it across your hair.  This helps blend the color into the hair without using too much and it isn't a heavy glob that will weigh down your hair and make it feel oily.  The color itself works well along the root line for between coloring touch ups. I color my hair with medium red and it blends well.",2,4,-2

I loved the size and it felt weightless. I heated up great.  My only wish for this item is that it came in a little bit of a bigger wave.  It felt more like a crimper. I used it at the beach so i was ok with that but if you were looking for true beach waves this might not be for you easy to use and not too big. perfect for a quick straighten This product works well and smoothes my hair really well BUTTTT it doesn’t stay straight and smooth. Love this for travel heats up very fast gives get curls the size is just perfect for carry in purse to work to freshen up your hair for going out the only problem was that the clips for rollers were hard to find so i included a pictures of where u can find the clips so more customers won’t have to call customer dervice So after the other irons failed I ordered the first one I actually glanced at but thought Conair they’re intobigger and better items.  How good could this little product be? So I bought it. It was delivered and I openedthe box and the waver was so small!  It’s adorable! The quality excellent and of course I had to try it right away. OMG it’s just what I was looking for.  I have short layered hair and it gives super defined waves and most of all for me it doesn’t DRY YOUR HAIR while waving! Also you can get pretty close to your scalp without burning it. It’s a gem! I would recommend this definitely!!  Hard to use. This little Conair mini smoothing brush does the job for my mid length bob.  Takes care of frizzies and finishing my hair after blow drying.  Would buy again!,2,3,-1

Let me start by saying I have very fine blonde hair and have been using a curling iron for about 40 years. I usually go cheap ( <$20 ) because they only last a year or so. The heating elements still work but the springs always break. Toss and buy another. Rinse & Repeat. I decided I’d spend a little more money and see if I’d have better luck.  When I opened up the box and was admiring the beauty of it, a little plastic bag fell out. I picked it up and when I saw what was inside I dropped to my knees! Hallelujah! Replacement springs! So even spending more, this is actually a bargain. Then I saw an order form for replacement springs. Holy Moly, I’m going to have this iron for the rest of my life! BTW: I love it! Nice tight curls, adjustable heat up to 430f, swivel cord so it doesn’t get twisted. I would buy again, but I don’t think I’ll have to 😉 This is my second time buying this curling iron. My first one lasted years, so long I'm not exactly sure how many years. I bought a new one because the clamp was getting a little loose/hair slipped out a bit, and I couldn't find the replacement pieces that came with it (again, because it lasted YEARS). This one is already off to a great start. I have shoulder length hair and use this at least twice a week. Love it! I am on my 2nd Hot Tools Curling Iron. My last one lasted 14 years. Actually, it never died. I replaced it because the handle was getting gummed up after 14 years of daily use.I would love to try one of the more expensive curling irons but this has been a tried and true brand for me so No need to look elsewhere. I might try the 1.5 inch to produce a little more curl towards the top of the hair, otherwise I love this tool! I have not curled my hair in AGES!!! Thank you to my daughter who helped me find and purchase this curling iron. I love how it swivels at the bottom when curling … no more twisted cords is a plus.Sorry … to the person asking if it comes with an extra spring - it DOES! Hot Tools are the only way to go. It’s perfect for finishing a great, natural hair style.Only product I will buy for a curling iron.High quality!Quick delivery. Great curls that hold their shape all day. Zero complaints on this curling iron, best one I've ever owned. This is the second I've owned aabout 3 years. This new one replaces one that had intermittent power delivery issues that required the cord to moved about just below the rubber ""flex fitting"" where the cord enters the handle.The cord consists of two separate 16ga conductors (one ea white and black) encased in a molded jacket that included material between the conductors. It appears well made and molded in (UL) on the jacket.The individual conductors appear to be copper and are multi strand.Thus, for maximum cord life it would be good to avoid bending  the cord where it leaves the flex fitting.",1,1,0

I only received one. However, the product itself is awesome. Paid for 6 items and was delivered 3 ( package of 2 )..false advertising and a scam. Tengo el cabello grueso y mucho, pongo este producto después de secarme y lo deja muy brilloso y manejable. No encontré otro producto que se le parezca, me encanta. I have used this product for 15+ years and swear by it for anyone who's hair gets frizzy easily especially during the humid months. I tend to get the little baby hair curls around my face so when I use this product it helps keep those under control and smooth with the rest of my hair. The anti-humectant pomade also leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny. I never leave home without it. I only use a dime size amount that I place in the palm of my hand and smooth all over my hands before running my hands through my hair. This helps keep your hair from looking oily. I usually apply any excess product on my hands to the ends of my hair and hair cowlicks.The only reason I gave this review 4 stars is because the product delivered was very oily to the point I was able to pour it out. This is the first time I have ever seen it like that. The product shouldn't be a liquid form at all. The consistency is more of a solid oil base texture. I would have given 4 1/2 starts, but that option isn't available. I have looked for other anti-humectant products and nothing compares to this specific product. Light, non greasy, leaves hair shining There’s no other product like this one. It smells wonderful and it really does repel humidity so that my hair doesn’t link up too bad when it’s extremely humid or when I sit in my hot tub.I will have a tough time if it’s ever discontinued. I've been using this for 20 years and nothing else comes close to giving me these results.  (and the smell is so yummy)  One jar lasts forever because you need so little of it!!The way I do my hair:  spray heat protectant, dry and curl, medium hairspray for body and hold and then, I put about a half of a pea-size amount on my fingertips and rub fingers together to warm it up so it spreads sparingly and evenly.  First, I kind of wave my fingers ever so lightly, like a light dusting, over the ends and then I go back and gently pull/ loosen the curls, using my fingers as a pick.  I don't like barrel-curls and this give you pretty texture/ movement.  (I'm Caucasian with ends that will just always be frizzy, and it's shoulder length with lot of thin hair that doesn't have root body.)I really mean half of a pea-size; with a heavy hand you'll have to rewash it before you can leave the house!!  And stay away from the roots; just lightly do the ends.  It will be a sad sad day if/when they ever discontinue it. I'm African American and I've been natural for almost 4 years but I wear my hair straightened or heat styled.  I live on the coast in the southeast.  The humidity here is unbearable.  Even when I did have a relaxer, I would step out of the house in the morning and all the effort that I put into styling my hair would just melt away.  I had to start wearing sew-ins and I wouldn't dare be caught at a club or someplace that had the potential to make me sweat.  Until I found this.  My hair lasts ALL DAY LONG.  A little goes a long way and it's a true pomade because it emulsifies once you rub it in your hand.  The only thing that I don't like about it is that if you use too much it could make your hair look greasy and flat.  I recently went to an amusement park and my hair lasted from 9am until 10pm. No frizz, no fly aways.  I'm truly amazed.",1,1,0

This product is a wonder! I feel so much better!  I recently had allergy testing done and I’m allergic to something called Balsam of Peru - which I’d never heard of before. It’s in many, many soaps and it’s the culprit. My allergist suggested this product and it’s wonderful!  So happy! After a few weeks of regular use, my dry, cracking, peeling, and blistered hands are back to normal. My eczema was so bad my fingertips were peeling off. I switched up all my products but I think this was the key. I love the pump, it's just slightly firmer than typical soap pumps which helps me use only the amount I need. Just wish the bottle was a little cuter! I like the fragrance free aspect of this product. It cleans well and has a short dispenser pump so don’t use too much soap.  It is a little expensive but other products I’ve tried are not fragrance free, which is a must for allergies. Vanicream is known for it's quality, inexpensive cleansers and this one does not disappoint. The lather on this is fantastic and it leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. I have really bad eczema on my hands and I'm always looking for hand soap that doesn't make my eczema works. This one is okay, it definitely washes your hands, but the price is a bit much for the small container. I've purchased this several times. My dermatologist gave me samples of this and the lite lotion YEARS ago. I haven't stopped using it since. Doesn't dry your skin and the lotion hydrates with the right balance, not too heavy and no clogged pores. Vanicream liquid cleanser is really gentle in your skin. It doesn’t dry it out, leaving it nice and soft. I like that there is no scent.  I have Rosacea so this is a great product for those of you with sensitive skin. My dermatologist hadsuggested that I try this product. This cleanser is great! Use the 32 oz. to refill small pump bottles. Great for showers and washing your face as well as at the sinks to wash hands. No smell and cleans well without stripping your skin. Highly recommended. Great seller. Packaged very well. Decent delivery time.",5,1,4

Leaves hair soft and tangle free. I love this scented shampoo for my synthetic wigs. This shampoo makes the wig look fluffy and natural. First, lightly brush out wig. I wash my wigs once a week and lightly wrap it in a absorbing towel for a few hours. Then take another dry towel and put it inside of the wig - the cap area- to ensure the cap becomes dry. Once the wig is completely dry, I use a wig brush or a Denman brush to lightly brush it out. Lastly, I give it a good shake and put it on a wig head. This product works great! I like the scent and appearance after using, but it doesn’t seem to have an ingredient to combat static. I’ve never had a static issue prior to using this product.

What would be more of a test than me trying this on Platinum Blonde hair... following directions- my hair came out very clean, with a nice but not over powering fragrance.  I'm sold...as someone seeking practical and economical solutions to my personal needs. My hair did come out with a lot of body, volume... which I prefer to tame with heat... but it also indicates it does what the manufacturer says it will. Leaves hair smelling good and soft.

The mist was perfect for applying to sections of my thick shoulder length hair before rolling in 5 hot rollers. The spray dries quickly, and my hair maintains a nice loose curl after removing the rollers. I had not heard of Kenra before. The bottle is well designed for holding, and the nozzle does NOT clog. This is now my favorite styling spray! I thought that this was a heat protector that you apply to wet hair.I have been using this since I bought it and I love it!! I will be buying it again I love this for use with hot rollers. I have fine, soft hair that wants to go flat despite hot rollers, hairspray, etc. With this spray, the curls hold and my hair has body and lift that stays all day! Will use this from now on for sure! I found this product to be heavy and sticky, and after using it, my hair felt like it needed to be washed, even though it washed it before using the product. I don't recommend Product is fine and I love receiving it on a regular basis.

I use this for my clients to prep hair for curling with heat tools. Curls can stay for days even with stubbornly straight and fine hair. It smells great and my clients always enjoy its scent. However everyone needs to know that there’s something really crappy about the bottle itself. The bottle is somehow slippery so it’s hard to grip and press the spray down. I used to look ridiculous holding the bottle with both hands trying to spray section by section. Solution: buy an empty spray bottle that has more of a trigger spray and decanter the whole thing into it. Kitsch makes one that has a nice lock so it’s good for travel. Hope this helps someone :) Great product Staying power is great, this was recommended by my friend who owns a hair salon. My problem is you need to spray each section separately before you curl which means you’re holding hair in one hand and the spray bottle in the other. It is almost completely impossible to push the spray plunger down. It is just awful it literally takes every ounce of strength I have because it is incredibly awkward. This is a real flaw and I will probably not order this exact brand again because it’s miserable to use I didn't realize I was paying more for buying more than one. I want make that mistake again. Used this product for 10 years! I keep going back. The pump situation is awful. As I'm seeing right now. This isy second bottle. Same difficulty actually yet the product out. Huge flaw. I've washed the pump and bottle every time so next time it's ready to go.  Doesn't help whatsoever lol. Wtf it's such a good product WHEN YOU USE IT THE VERY FIRST TIME and never again. Seriously aggravated. Same exact thing happened to a friend I convinced to purchase before I understood the design flaw. I love this product! My fine, naturally straight hair has never been the type to hold a curl with just a curling rod, but I now use some mousse, blow dry, then spray this on and curl, break it apart with my fingers, & I’m good for no-maintenance curls for about 3 days after! After 3 days I’ll need to do some touch-ups as the curls do fall gradually but heck! That is amazing coming from someone who usually cannot get curls to hold longer than a few hours before looking like I’d never curled it in the first place. I must say, if I spray enough my hair is crunchy & I absolutely have to spend a while breaking apart the curls or my hair is sort of hard & the curls are too tight for my liking. But this last time I didn’t use as much and didn’t have to spend so much time doing that. I curl my hair about once a week since it holds for a good 4 days or so before I end up washing it. I then go straight for about 3 days then curl again and repeat the process. Day 1 it’s usually pretty dang curly. Then day two a bit less, day 3 it’s more some curl/some wave, day 4 it’s sort of straight-ish/a little wavy - On the 3 ish days that my hair is straight with no product (before I curl it bc I don’t usually curl my hair when it’s super clean), it’s still very soft & shiny. So this product must be doing a great job protecting my hair from the 400° wand I use on it weekly. (I also dye my hair blonde so if anyone should have damage from all that, it should be me!)  Anyway I just bought my second bottle of this stuff, the last one lasted me about 3 months. I may have been spraying too much (not really sure how much you’re supposed to use!) so three months isn’t bad at all (in my opinion.) I love this and will continue to purchase it as needed! For what I paid, I expected to spray the bottle easily! Once I got the product out, it worked fabulous, but it was very difficult to spray.",3,3,0

I should of used a 10 volume for my hair dye. I was depositing color not lifting. Turned out with less reddish orange hues. Thanks again! I will use this in the future. This is SUCH a LIFE SAVER!!! I had CLOWN ORANGE HAIR!!! I went on YouTube and found one of those CHILD YOUTUBE STARS (Some of them are geniuses) and VOILA found a girl with the solution to my devastating problem... ARDELL COLOR CORRECTOR! Sad reality is, this was not the first time I've messed up my hair color wise... My solution was to Cut it and start over again... NOT THIS TIME! My hair went from the wrong kind of Raggedy Ann to a soft Blond/light brown. So pretty! I LOVE IT! and in between you can just put the drops in your conditioner and keep the Brassiness away. I have Hard water that changes my color so this keeps it under wraps. Great product! I have dark brown hair which is now mixed with plenty of white. I put in the required amount of drops to my coloring and I’m so thankful I did because otherwise it would’ve come out orange as it has in the past. Not attractive!With these color correction drafts I get a very nice blonde in the white hairs come out with a nice blonde tint to them making it look more natural than a home color job. It’s a good product but hard to find on the market outside and stores so as usual I can run to Amazon and find what I need. Will buy again and again and recommend it highly. Works well but you need to use a lot of it, value for money wasn’t worth it I've been using this for several years, and it works for gray, and brown in my hair which is dyed to ash blond. using sally beauty hair dye for gray hair.  Too much of this product, and hair turns a bit too brown.Using too little, it's too orange. Now I read on amazon tonight, that people are using gentian violet, or a good brand of food coloring. much cheaper. also, and they are also adding it to shampoo and /or conditioner. blue tones down orange more than violet, they said. use whatever is opposite on the color wheel to tone down the color, apparently. there is plenty on the web about this. wash with hot water to open cuticle and close cuticle by rinsing with cold water. good reminder is that causes of brassiness, orange can be hard water, minerals in water, sun, chlorine. sorry that i havent tried this, so cant recommend a recipe.  apparently washing with blue-purple shampoo/conditioner about once a week helps maintain color  without brassiness, so there is less correction when it is time to dye it again.  I have brown roots in bang area, and gray almost white roots on top, and brown roots in back. I've trusted this product for years to help me achieve my cool brown hair. It's the only thing that keeps me from going orange. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I have been coloring my own hair blonde for over 20yrs & I refuse to color it wOUT this product! I've NEVER had an issue with brassy tones OR any of the red from my natural strawberry blonde hair showing. Now that my hair is approx 80% white, THIS product keeps my blonde beautiful! I get compliments on my hair ALL the time and I SWEAR this little bottle is my secret. If you are having ANY of these issues while coloring your own hair, THIS is the game changer you've been missing!No, I was not compensated for this review in ANY way, I just depend on this product for my everyday look!

Sometimes it looks like Christmas came early, especially if everyone's wearing black.That's why I started handing Head and Shoulders out as stocking stuffers / gifts. Sure, it's uncomfortable when they open the gift in front of everyone, but in the long haul I feel it pays dividends. Just the reduction in scratching noises alone is worth the price. You get enough of us geeks in the same big room and it starts sounding like a dog pound.Anyhoo, I definitely recommend Head and Shoulders for anyone in IT. I can remember being a kid and my mother using the original formula on my hair, she swore by it and still says it's one of the reasons I had very few issues with my hair. As an adult I have used it to help with flakes and relieve my poor dry scalp. The 2 in one formula is not as good as it could be however I still find it does an a decent job keeping my hair soft and flake free for the most part.I have a difficult scalp and it's really the only shampoo that offers me some degree of comfort. Over all I miss the older formula but I will stay with the brand I have come to know. Good 👍 My husband likes it, his dandruff is under control, he's used it for years.My overly sensitive nose/lungs are offended by the strong scent that spreads throughout the entire home when he uses HOT water instead of warm. I'm allergic to any artificial and/or strong fragrance (it make my nose upset, migraine starts, and asthma triggers.) We have to shut the bathroom door and leave an air purifier on when he showers so my allergies' don't freak out. I have been buying Head and Shoulders for 15 years, and just alternating the scents. There is no fresher scent than the scents H&S do. A big drawback of other scented shampoos at this affordable price range are that they smell like cheap flowery perfume or that they smell like cheap Axe-type cologne. H&S smells classic, never too cologne-y or like douchey dude, but like a great, fresh, unisex smell that refreshes you. I ALWAYS get compliments on the scent of my hair, and it's always this. Helps with itchy scalp issues.  Cleans Hair well smells ok.  Not using it for dandruff so can not report.  but does help with dry itchy winter scalp.  does not burn your head.  I still put my own conditioner on my hair.  I have really thick hair.  So I needed that extra lift.  I think it works ok. I don't get dandruff but my boyfriend does so I got this for him on a whim and he loves it. He uses it daily even though its the summer to prevent dandruff and in the winter with another stronger (more expensive) shampoo to really fight the flakes.I don't notice any scent or build-up and it's a good price, my only issue is they may want to look into adding tea tree oil as that seems to be the only thing able to fight dandruff in the harsh winter months. Yes, Head and Shoulders' products are expensive, a little over $8 a bottle! (much of that can be attributed to the Proctor & and Gamble brand name more than anything), however, the product as a shampoo works well. I have used generic shampoos at over half the cost of H&S (i.e. Walmart's Equate and Supervalu's Equaline products) and they have left my hair looking greasy after four hours of use.  I have noticed that Head and Shoulders shampoos actually ""clean"" my hair, without the greasy looking gloss shortly after. I recommend using H&S shampoo to anyone, it's worth shuffling out a few extra bucks to get  a quality product sometimes.",1,4,-3

These scissors are nice and sharp, cutting the hair well, but the points are very sharp.  I wish they had a blunt tip. The quality of Revlon's Barber Shears has gone severely downhill with this product.  I have been using these for many many years, even though they don't really last that long.  Locally, they've gotten ridiculously expensive, just over $17 for one pair in one store.  Still cheaper here even when that store has them on sale for buy one, get one half off.  The inner screw constantly needs to be tightened on my older pairs, which is why I ordered these replacements, and much cheaper than my local store.  You can tell right off the bat, they are substantially lighter than the older scissors, and a lighter metal is being used.  They're also a bit duller than the previous models, not as sharp as they used to be.  Those inner rubber rings are super annoying, so thankfully they're removable.  Until I find a better shear, I'll have to stick with these. I misplaced my good barber shears and read numerous reviews wanting to find a low cost, but good shears as a replacement.  This pair has one good quality, sharpness.  Here are the not so good:1)  can only use for light trimming, can't cut through sections of hair like for a straight line trim at bottom of hair, blades deflect and don't cut (had to use my Fiskar desk scissors for that)2)  the rubber finger cushions are not glued in place and come out repeatedly and easily while cutting with the shearsMy experience indicates that I should shop at local beauty supply stores where I can inspect before buying. I bought several pair of barber shears recently, & these stand above the rest.You can feel the difference of the made in usa precision ground blades.They also give a much cleaner cut.Lifetime warranty to boot. Cut nothing but hair with these & I think you will be very pleased.Looks like the made in China pair will go into the dog grooming kit, And the Revlons willbe cutting my hair. Highly recommended. I bought this barber shears for me and my husband. We cut each others hair once a month. For me the shears are okay, but for my husband the scissors handle (where you put your fingers through) is a little to narrow, even though his hands are neither big or fat. Otherwise it does the job good.I recommend these shears for women's hands only. so happy finally I found the right shears..7"" to be excact easy to use very sharp,I know these shears will last me a long time..I cut my own bangs and split ends and my loong hair looks great!! I do recommend it to those who likes to cut or trim their own hair! I wanted a precision shear that is extremely sharp all the way through the point.  These did not fit my requirements.  They are ok to use for cutting, but as you get close to the end, they stop and you have to adjust.  I'll keep them but I still need something more professional. Good scissors for the price. We use them to cut our son's hair. I would buy them again and would recommend to a friend as well.",3,2,1

I have hair that is long, just about to hit my natural waistline. I have also color treated my hair often, and use a flat iron and curling wand on a regular basis. After I started using this condition, my stylist was amazed. She said my hair looked and felt like virgin hair, and I didn't need to even get a trim after months without having one, because I had no split ends at all! Pretty awesome! I shampoo twice a week, and condition every day. On the days I don use shampoo, I first get my hair all wet, I scrub my scalp with just water, I put loads of this conditioner on starting with the ends, and working my way up the hair, but avoiding the roots on the top of my head and around my part. I then take a dove bar soap and glide it over my hairline and part. I let all this soak on to my hair for the remainder of my shower and then rinse it out when is done with everything else. Most days I let my hair air-dry afterwards. I like this product a lot. Makes hair feel very soft and silky. For a Dove hair care product I am pleasantly surprised at how rich and thick the conditioner is. Of course I love the way it smells too. My only complaint is I find it leaves a heavy residue on my hair so in a day or so it appears greasy even though it's not. I've been using this every time I shower but I might limit its use to 1x/week to avoid the residue buildup it seems to create. Otherwise happy and I would buy again This conditioner is one of the best we have ever used!It controls frizz and leaves hair moisturized like the expensive salon brands without the 50 dollar price tag.It does not weigh hair down and soothes the scalp and hair. I would put this conditioner right up there with Biolage the slip is the same and your hair will thank you. Love this it is my favourite conditioner but with the small bottles here, I run out very fast. I was so delighted to be able to get these large ottles and have them delivered with no trouble at all yay!! Big thumbs p Favorite brand I like this conditioner.  No issues.  I think it is cheaper at local stores, but it was convenient to order online. I love this product for my girls and my terribly tangly hair. Smooths it out so there is minimal snagging/crying, even for my 4 year old. We have below-waist length hair. We'll always have this on hand.",1,5,-4

Anyway the product works it got rid of most of the gray hairs ( I didn't do a perfect application as it was just a test run). I waited ten minutes before washing it out my skin did feel a bit irritated right at the ten minute mark so maybe next time I'll leave it in for 7 minutes instead. Instructions were very easy to follow. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future for my beard hairs. I've been using this product for some time as my beard seemed to have gotten a bit whiter than I  was ready for. My head hair, while getting thinner, has remained dark and I wasn't a fan of the contrast. This product has gone up in price at my local stores (significantly) so I tried going without during the lockdowns. I had no clue how much grey had infected my face!! Before I went back to in-person full time work I went ahead and paid the price locally, but purchased the Dark Brown that I had before. After applying it I got distracted by something on TV and waited and extra 2 minutes: DO NOT DO THIS!! I looked like I was about to sell some sketchy product on a late-night TV commercial.After trimming my beard REALLY short to hide the mistake I purchased the Light Brown and the next time I applied it I watched the clock like a person who had screwed up his FACE before by not watching the clock, stepped into the shower 5 minutes exactly after applying it and was rewarded by a moderately less grey appearance.Be aware: The color 100% does NOT last for 6 weeks. You'll be lucky to get 3 weeks between applications of you want to maintain the look. 3-Pack price was decent enough, delivery was fast and I would recommend this product. I Ike the color, I got dark brown, I actually got it for brow tinting and it came out perfect, not too dark or light, I did keep it on 10 minutes instead of 5. Smells much nicer than previous formula and it does seem to last a little longer.  Looks best and most natural if you leave some gray streaks or areas at the ends, otherwise people that know dyes will always spot a dye job that is too uniform in color or too dark.  I do wish they offered a much larger size option with larger tubes of product. The medium dark brown color is the best. Ive used Just for Men for years and honestly its work the subscribe and save on this product. Its far more expensive everywhere else. Mine lasts a good while but since i clip my beard I use a box every 10 days. 1 box though covers a lot of grey. Keep it on longer than 5 mins for a deeper color, FYI before coloring take some Vaseline and slightly rub in areas around the beard tip of nose on the neck line anyplace you dont want stained. I wipe my hands and nails with it too. it will prevent the color from staining your skin. But even if you get a stain just rub it off with some Vaseline or petroleum jelly. I love this product; and this seller is pretty cool. Ive never had any issues. The three pack is totally worth it. What can I say... Easy and Clean to use. Super convenient brush for targeted use. Doesn't burn like a lot of other ones I've used in the past.... And really does get you right in 5 MINUTES as described. Works very well. Wonderful product",4,3,1

It has been hard to find good products for it.  Oh!  Did I mention it is very fine and tangles easily.  These are the only products I've found that work with it.  If I shower every day including washing and conditioning my hair, it looks and feels like silk -- and does NOT tangle.  If I'm moving fast for many different reasons and decide I can't spare the 8 minutes of a shower, I pay.  Boy, do I pay ...I don't need to blow dry it or put any other products on my hair.  All I need to do is brush it out and let it dry. Been using this for 8 years So I got a sample of this product like a year ago, and saved the packaging cause I loved it! Fast forward a year I was having scalp issues and finally decided to buy a new shampoo. This one instantly revived my hair and made my scalp feel like a million times better! I love this product. It’s written in Japanese which is funny cause I still have my sample package that’s in English. *Updated Review*Beware! This is not the real deal!I originally gave the Komenuka hair care products five stars because they really are incredible. They are still the only products that I'm not sensitive to, and I love how good my hair looks when I use them. However, I recently started feeling like I wasn't getting the same results. My hair was oily like it is when I use sulfate filled shampoos, and I kept getting too many tangles. At first it was just a passing thought, but after a few weeks it became my suspicion that the products had changed somehow. To see if anyone else felt the same way as I did, I read recent bad reviews and found one that warned that this is not the real product! The reviewer had called Komenuka and learned that they can't make it and sell it for less than the steep $28 per bottle price tag, so whatever is being sold at discounted prices isn't their product. As a test, I ordered a new bottle from the Komenuka website. The differences are subtle, but there. The bottles are slightly different shades of pale yellow, and the true Komenuka bottle has very clear script on it while the knock of looks like an image that was probably scanned and is much less clear. Who knows where this is being made or what's in it? Most likely NOT the same ingredients it claims to have. If you're interested in trying Komenuka, I would definitely suggest you do! Just remember to pay the full sticker price and order it from the Komenuka website until Amazon gets this figured out.(Old Review)With a price tag of $50, I expected the bottles to be larger than they are. Note that the shampoo is only 11 oz. and the conditioner is only 7.7 oz. That's a little on the expensive side, but I decided to give the product a try anyway... and now I'm hooked! It's hard to explain what makes a shampoo different than all the rest, but this one really is nicer than anything I have ever tried. It smells nice, it lathers beautifully, and most importantly, it makes my hair look fantastic. My husband picked it up in the shower and now he's hooked, too! He has very sensitive skin, and it has completely relieved his dandruff. Regarding hair types, I have fine blonde hair that is often made flat and boring with conditioner, and he has corse, black hair that gets frizzy when dried out by shampoo. Komenuka works beautifully for the both of us. If you have the budget for fancier hair care products, this one is worth a shot. If you don't have the budget, don't even try it. You will certainly want to come back for more. I loved the scent and grow my hair so fast It has been more than 20 years that I have been using this great products. Honestly you need a very small amount of shampoo to make your hair soft moisturized and hydrated. This shampoo smells great and one would last you min of five months. I highly suggest  this amazing product. I like that it doesn't contain parabens or sulfates. I read about this in a style book and it was highly recommended. I was a little disappointed in the scent...it's boring..like Pantene or something. Also, my hair is super dry and this conditioner wasn't a strong enough moisturizer. I probably won't purchase again but im using up my bottles for sure. I purchased this produduct for a few times. but this time the conditioner is half.I opened that today.unfortunatly I see  its half of the tube.I dont want buy again.",5,4,1

Calms Frizz, Detangles, Wash & Go, Co Wash, No Parabens, Color Safe, Sulfate Free (3 Pack)","I have been using Giovanni products for the past 7 years now and I don’t know why I never thought to write a review up until now. I think it’s because now I work part time at a beauty supply store and I find myself recommending this line to so many frustrated and natural hair customers; I  feel the need to expand my review and add it to online shoppers as well. I am a black woman with natural curly/coily hair. I don’t do hair typing but for those that need it, I’d chart my hair type as a little 3C, mostly 4A and 4B. As you can tell, I have some loose curls but majority of my hair is kinky/coily. Why I love Giovanni and why it works for me. Now in the shampoo and conditioner, I’ve used both the tea tree one and smooth as silk one. My FAVE is smooth as silk although both are amazing to me. I get a lot of slip with this conditioner which allows my hair to detangle very easily. It has no sulfates nor is it drying. My hair feels so soft and it so detangled after use. Also, because I used to be a product junkie, I try to keep my products at a minimum now and this conditioner can be used for both co washing and for deep conditioning. It is 100% vegetarian, is not animal tested, and has organic ingredients as well as essential oils added (such as rosemary which promotes hair growth). I LOVE this stuff and even though I’ve strayed over the years and have tried other brands that seemed promising, I always come back to this! Nothing gets the job done and makes my hair feel as good as Giovanni does. Usually I wouldn’t go for a product that is “for all hair types” as those products are usually not designed for my hair and can have harmful and damaging effects but when I first when natural years ago, I saw this on sale at TJ MAxx and I purchased without knowing anything about natural hair care. I’m glad I did!!!!! This is a product I’m not afraid to recommend because I know it does exactly what I say it does. If you’re a natural like me, you should definitely give this a shot. Hope this review helps. I haven't used this conditioner before so I'm not really sure if it's doing what it's supposed to. I was surprised at how foamy it is and had to check the bottle to make sure I hadn't accidentally ordered shampoo but it said conditioner on the bottle. The smooth as silk conditioner to be specific. I don't remember if I originally ordered the smooth as silk or the 50/50 so whether I received what I ordered I will never know. I'm not really a fan of these amazon product listings that contain multiple items. Anyway, it wasn't great for detangling. I feel like I've been able to get my wide tooth comb to glide through my hair much easier using other conditioners. My hair felt super squeaky clean after rinsing it out which also seemed odd, but again, I don't know if that's how it's supposed to work. It seemed to do a great job at cleaning my hair which isn't what I needed since I already have shampoo. I'm using a deep conditioner so I likely won't be able to say whether this conditioner had any effect on my hair moisture level so I won't leave too negative of a rating. I'd heard really good reviews but I probably won't buy it again. It doesn't seem to suit my needs. Makes my curls soft & smooth This is an oldie, but goodie and still just as good. I am over 50% gray, and until I started coloring my hair a few months ago, it was very dry and tired-looking.  The hair color helps my hair look and feel better, but this conditioner makes my hair feel wonderful!I had not used conditioner much in recent years, but after I started using Giovanni shampoo a few months ago, I decided to try this conditioner.  Now I use it every time I shampoo, which is usually every other day.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. A little goes a long way; I have shoulder-length hair, and a quarter-sized dollop is enough to work through all of my hair. I appreciate the fact that it does not have an overpowering scent.The conditioner is so thick that sometimes I have to shake the bottle (with the cap closed) in order to move it toward the opening so I can dispense it.  The dispenser is easier to use than another brand of conditioner I have used.  I don't have any trouble getting the last bit out of the bottle, so there's no wasted product.I love this conditioner! I love it.  I love it even more in this bigger bottle! I bought this a few weeks ago.  I kept hoping I would get over the scent, but it's horrible. Too bad I'm past the time to return. Okay value for the 3 bottles, totals around 24 oz... We usually buy paraben and sulfate free products, around 32 oz for closer to $15 or so, from our local Grocery Outlet. Thought it would be nice to have our hair care on Subscribe and Save for the convenience but may stick with our prior routine...This conditioner feels wonderfully silky out of the bottle and smells great too. I wouldn't say it makes my hair especially silky though. It's nice, no added build-up or anything, just not better than other natural type products we've used for less.If it's in your budget, it's a good product and you may enjoy it. Not sure if we'll be sticking with this one though. Smile. Hope this is helpful!",3,5,-2

On month 2 I could already see results and month 3 I am clear that this product works for me. I then purchased (end February 2023)  a further 9 month supply (3 boxes of 3 topical solution bottles)My concern is the big difference in product vs what I purchased and received in December 2022.I have many times heard to be careful because there have been instances where products bought on Amazon was not official / not the original correct product but a copy.I am hoping someone can verify that the current 9 months supply I have of Rogaine is indeed the REAL product and not a counterfeit.Reasons for me being concerned and worriedTaking a look at the photosThe bottle on the left is from the latest purchase (All 9 month supply is this bottle)The bottle on the right is purchased from December 2022There is a definite difference in sizeThe cap from the first purchase is bigger and got child lock protection vs just a screw on capThe purchase from 3 months back have a later expiry date then the purchase from now February 2023The topical solution dropper from the initial purchase is much bigger and you can clearly see the 1ml mark and its easy to extract the solution.The new topical solution dropper is much smaller - the 1ml mark is barely visible and due to its size its very hard (nearly impossible) to extract 1ml of solution with it.Coming to the topical solution itselfThe initial purchaseWhen applying the solution I could feel on my scalp that I am actually applying a ""hard"" fluid which contains chemicalsThe topical solution dried my hair outAfter massaging it in it leaves I can say a sticky residue on my fingers which I need to wash off.The latest purchaseThe fluid looks and behaves like water.It creates bubbles in the dropper which the initial purchase never did.When applying to my scalp Its feels like water not the ""hard"" feeling as with the initial purchase supply.No sticky residue on my fingers after massaging it in - does not feel like I need to wash anything of my fingers.The smell is kind of similar to the intial purchase supply.I would really appreciate if someone can put my mind at ease and can confirm that all these NEW things I am finding is in fact new and that 9 month supply of Rogain I have purchased is legit/the real product I used other hair growth brands with no luck.  I’m pretty bald on top and Rogaine has really started new hair growth that I can see.  I need to use more than the recommended amount per application to cover the entire area but I’m enthusiastic about seeing new hair follicles. Hoping it continues so with time, the hair growth gets dense enough to make a difference from a distance. I’m confident it will.  Fingers crossed. Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5% Minoxidil Topical Aerosol, Easy-to-Use Foam, 2.11 Ounce, 3 Month Supply (Packaging May Vary)Rogaine Mens Regrowth X-Strength 5% Unscented 3 MonthRogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment, Extra Strength Original Unscented, Set of 3, 2-Ounce BottlesOn April 1, 2013, I started using Men's Rogaine Foam.I am a 33 year old female, with female hereditary hair loss.Last fall, I went to Dr. Michael Zufelt in Salt Lake City to consult with him over a hair transplant.  He recommended that I use Rogaine Foam, since I decided to put off a transplant surgery for the time being. I started using 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of foam once a day (in the mornings, after the shower when my hair was still wet).1. I immediately noticed that my hair was more dry in it's texture.  I also noticed that the foam had a thickening effect on my hair, which I surely did not mind since my hair is thin and fine. The first 2 months went well.2. In June (this month), I noticed that I was getting dizzy, nauseated, and my fingers and toes were tingling.  I truly did not think it was from the Rogaine since I had been using it for more than 60 days at this point.  I just decided to ignore it. So I kept using it.3. Also in June, I noticed a difference in my facial hair.  I usually have fine, light hair on my upper lip and chin ---- which I wax every 2 weeks, and have waxed every 2 weeks since age 20... well, this was coming in faster, so I had to wax every 1 week instead of every 2 weeks.  It did not come in darker or longer, it just came in faster.  And I thought if that was the worst side effect, I can live with it.4. But every day, the dizziness continued... and I think it's just from more blood circulating in your scalp (which the doctor said would happen with Rogaine - that's why you would have to stop using Rogaine about 10 days prior to any hair transplant since it would cause an increase in bleeding from your head).... but the tingling in my fingers and in my toes wouldn't stop.  AND I would feel just CRAPPY for the first 8 hours after I applied the Rogaine to my scalp. This crappy feeling got worse, so I lessened how much I was using.  But the side effects didn't stop.  So then I switched to applying at night before bed.  This helped, however, the feeling of ill-ease and tingly fingers have continued.5. But also in June - I have noticed my hair getting thicker finally!  I felt like this stuff was actually working!!So here I was, needing to make a decision - do I have dizziness, nausea, tingly digits and THICKER HAIR ON MY HEAD?Or...Do I have feelings of health and vigor.....yet THINNING HAIR?!Arghhhh!!!!The other problem with this stupid Rogaine is if you EVER stop using it, within 7 days, your hair loses any and all progress it made.  It goes right back to what you had before.  So you could use this stuff for DECADES and the moment you stop using it, it's back to its previous state ---all that dedication would be futile.After all my sobbing over my hair, I have decided that I will stop using Rogaine immediately....***If you click on my name (C'est Moi), you can view the other hair loss products I've tried...I've created an email for this specifically.  You can contact me at womenhairloss@outlook.com****Update 1/19/2013*************I have received several emails from Amazon customers, and I thought I would share my recommendations that I've emailed recently.  (you can email me at womenhairloss@outlook.com - I usually check it once a week)Hair is very crucial to a woman's self esteem.  Especially if she's young.The one thing that I have to remind myself with any and all hair products is that results take time.  It's a very long, drawn out process to start seeing results.I'm the type of person that would love to never have to take a pill for anything EVER.So this is what I have found:#1: Determine if there might be some type of chemical inbalance.  (In my case it wasn't... just plain ol' female pattern hair loss.)  I would go to a hair loss doctor, usually the initial appointment is free to just consult... but the doctor I went to ordered a blood test to rule out thyroid and everything else.  So I would do this first.#2: Get some biotin and saw palmetto.  You can google these.  I have to take the biotin with a multivitamin because if there is too much B vitamin in your system, it flushes out (resulting in diahrea).  So I take 1000 mcg of biotin with a multivitamin every day and 160 mg of saw palmetto once every 2 days.  Saw palmetto constipates you and enlarges your breasts, so I don't take it every day.  If you can handle more than 1000 mcg of biotin per day, then do it!  You will notice STRENGTH in your hair and fingernails.  Saw palmetto removes DHT from follicles, but also there is a dandruff shampoo called ""Nizoral"" it's right by Head-and-Shoulders at the store, that is supposed to remove DHT from hair follicles too.  So try that too.#3: I've considered getting what are called ""top pieces"".  After several google searches, I have found this:  [...]  This is the only place I'd buy anything from.  They do skype consultations.#4: I have naturally thin/fine hair anyway, so as it is thinning, it's super difficult.  I have been using a lot of amplifying hair products that just make me look like I have more hair.  That is a great way to start.Here are the products I use (I kind of rotate which ones I use each day):-Samy Fat Hair ""0"" Calories Amplifying Mousse-John Frieda Luxurious Volume Fine to Full Blow-Out Spray-Bed Head Small Talk-Bed Head Superstar Queen for a Day-L'Oreal Everstyle volume root lifting spray#5: This is the one thing I do EVERY DAY that makes me feel INSTANTLY BETTER:  I grab my eyeshadow (which is a brown, since I have light brown hair:  Maybelline Stylish Smokes 225S ""Made for Mocha"") and I use my eyebrow brush and I dab my eyeshadow onto my head at my part and IT COVERS IT UP!!  I instantly look like I have more hair.#6: I have researched hair transplants... I still have not ruled this out, but I have read that women's hair thins all over their head (called ""diffuse thinning"") so using the back of the head hair to replace the top of the head hair is not ideal because the back of the head thins on women, whereas the back of the head does not thin for men.  So overall, even if I did get a transplant, it would only be to fill in the top, it will not give more body to my hair.#7: There is an online forum at [...] that I would love for you to read through.  It's super valuable information.  (I do not contribute to that website, but I do check it often).Good luck to all you hair loss sufferers!  We're in this together!****** I have used for the last 4 months. It seems to work for me. Sorry I didn’t take pictures before and after to compare, but my wife noticed the subtle difference. It has some odor on application. I think it’s worth trying.",2,1,1

Love the can and the spray. I a little pricy for drugstore brand. I've only used a handful of times, but it seems to work okay. I want something that has strong hold, but doesn't leave my hair hard and crunchy. So far this hairspray does just that, but I did notice my hair falling a little throughout the day. But that could be my fault. I didn't put a ton on. So with the little I used it did a pretty good job. I'm only giving 4/5 stars because the scent is a bit overwhelming. It smells nice, but it reminds me of a soap type smell. It can be a bit much especially right by your face. I'm getting used to it though. If it works, I'll get past the smell! This spray has a pleasant scent. Reminds me of a salon product scent. I usually use this for just getting a little hold and texture in my hair after drying and styling. It isn’t a hard hold and doesn’t make your hair stiff. I can still manage it and that’s what I like about this spray. I have baby fine, slightly wavy hair that wants to fly away or go flat. Many hairsprays have water, which deflates the soufflé I create, (not a bouffant by any means, just normal volume with a bob, but with my hair, the default is flat and limp. Handling it much makes it go flat, so I think of it as a soufflé) but this just preserves the freshly blown out style all day, without looking at all stiff or being sticky. I can reapply if I wish, and brushing is very easy-- no damaging ripping noise like with other strong hold sprays, and no perceptible build up. My one gripe is that the scent is an acquired taste: sort of an old-fashioned chypre that smells like Parisian lady perfumes. There is an unscented version in regular hold, but it is hard to find. I love this hairspray.. its light sent although I have a thing for sweet smells this does smell nice and it goes on so easy..don't need to take a cover off ..the place to press to spray is contained so conveniently.. holds pretty well without being sticky and too stiff.. I like it and will continue to use this product.  I was buying a much more expensive brand but this is pretty good for the value.. just need a travel size can as this one is too tall for travel .. but I am not complaining..love it This product is just okay. Not a strong hold, just ok.  I really like the scent.  Unfortunately, most of the time it is way overpriced so I don’t buy it often. I absolutely love this hairspray!!  When I first read about it and then saw the price, I had to swallow hard before buying it.  However, once I used it, I was hooked!!  I live in Florida, which has very high humidity about 85% of the year - great for the skin, not so much for hair.  My hair is thin and inclined to frizz in the humidity, but this hairspray makes it seem thicker and definitely tones down the frizziness on humid days/nights.  I love that I can comb thru my hair after the spray dries and it still feels thick, doesn't frizz, and stays in place, but isn't ""helmet hair""!!  I usually get it at Ulta or Bed, Bath and Beyond, using 20% off coupons, but found it here on Amazon just a bit cheaper - no tax does make a difference. Very good hairspray that doesn’t weigh your hair down. I have fine/limp hair and it has great hold without feeling sticky. I don’t know who came up with the scent but I find it outdated and awful.",2,4,-2

The first 10 years I used them I was doing hair professionally and this is only the 4th iron I have purchased in 25 years.  I should mention that the third one I purchased, a Gold Iron, is still working. I only bought this one because I read the reviews on this and decided to treat myself.Pros:Ceramic barrel means NO BAKED ON HAIR PRODUCT RESIDUE to clean off!!!! I ordered this iron over 6 months ago for personal use and I use a lot of gel and hairspray on my hair and it is CLEAN.Heats up hot and fast. (I use wet towel to cool down before applying to dry hair)Has safety stand and the swivel cord means it does not get twisted up.CONS:The only thing I do not like is the ""ON light"" it is not bright or distinctive enough to notice in a room that is well-lit or with natural lighting. I have become a little OCD with checking that the iron is off because just turning off the bathroom light during the day (we have a skylight) will not get the room dark enough to determine if the iron is off just with the ""ON light"". It is easy to see in a dark room.Maybe as a side-note con I could mention that I would much prefer the on/off switch on the cord, less likely to accidentally turn it off or on.Other than that, it is perfect and neither the ""ON light"" nor the switch placement would not be enough to keep me from recommending it or to keep me from buying one again. First of all, Amazon has the best price for this and it arrived right away, so five stars for Amazon too. :) This is my first marcel iron. I was a little bit nervous about it, but figured if the pros use it, it must be better and it's a still a dang curling iron, so how hard could it be? Not that hard. The awkwardness went away during the first use and my curls are AWESOME. This thing gets HOT FAST. I think I have the dial somewhere around halfway (350 maybe???), and that's plenty hot. I spritz on a little heat protector before i start and use a light dusting of hairspray as I curl. The curls are SO shiny and last all day. For day two, I'll just freshen up the top layer a bit, so they don't look slept on, but the curls really do last. I've bought very high-end and very low-end hairdryers and styling tools, and this has proven to be the absolute best of both worlds. At the Amazon price, this isn't much more expensive than the drugstore brands, but the performance is leagues beyond those. Ceramic is worth the couple of extra bucks, because it really keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking. I think the 1"" barrel is probably the best all-around size - you can get a lot of pretty tight curls with it if you use small sections, but it's also big enough for the big, loose waves that I usually wear. I actually switched down from a very large barrel iron to this one for the large waves - there's enough even heat with this to curl well through a relatively thick chunk of hair. Bottom line: I recommend this without reservation. I purchased this item since I've been longing to learn how to use the marcel iron and I love my other hot tools irons.I watched a few tutorials before using.  I find it slightly more time-consuming but the curls look more natural than a typical curling iron. I took off a star because my curls just don't last as long as when I use my other hot tools irons.  I'm not sure if this is due to my technique?  I've used a ton of hairspray and they still relax so much that I have to re-curl the next day.  I ordered the 3/4"" and 1/2"" models.  Hopefully they will provide a longer-lasting curl since the original curl will be tighter.I didn't find it that hard to use, but I cheated a little bit. Sometimes I used both hands.The picture is from the first time I curled my hair using this 1"" marcel. I've been slinging hair since 1989 and this is the best electric marcel iron I've owned and I've used quite a few over the decades.  My last purchase was another manufacturer whom I would never waste my money or time with as their product failed.  Rubber grips aren't supposed to become 'gummy' like unless the rubber is faulty which in fact those tools were.  My Other HOT TOOLS I've purchased were amazing but didn't have the Nano Ceramic technology - those were the gold ones.  The difference is performance and cleaning.  Products do not stick nor scorch on the tool when wiped down properly after usage.  If you don't clean your tools with the Hot Tool Cleanser or a gentle soap/water mix, stuff can build up and thus scorch.  The Nano Ceramic tools however don't allow product to bake on or build up.  The hair comes out of the marcel iron curled and the cuticle is smoothed and not fried in the appearance.  I recommend this tool in any size.  The 1"" is a great over all iron for volume and curls! I have the 1 1/2 in marcel hot tools nano ceramic and have had it for years. I have used that thing everyday and it has been dropped on the floor over and over and it still works great. Everyone asks me how I curl my hair and I tell them the marcel makes a big difference in the longevity of your curls. If your looking for big loose curls go with the bigger 1 1/2, but I got this one for more of a beachy wave and for my daughters hair which is shorter and needs a tighter curl. Hot tools works great..no need to spend double the money for some fancy name brand. Fyi..if you have never used a marcel it takes a couples time to get the hang of it..I burned myself a few times, but they do work so much better than a regular curling iron. Like I said I have had mine for years and its no big deal to use now. Great curling iron for the price.",1,5,-4

I've never used a comb on my wet hair before but I started when I got this product and wow....huge difference. My sister hooked me on this and my hair feels and looks so much healthier. I've also lessened the blow drying and other heat if I can but seriously, there's not much of a smell and it doesn't stain shirts, get it.....get it now!! This Placenta Leave-In Treatment is EVERYTHING! It leaves my hair really soft and extra bouncy! It has so much body after I blow dry it, that people often think I just came from the salon. This is a game changer.It really detangles your hair! Best conditioner on the market. I am amazed at how well this product works. I am actually receiving compliments on my hair's improvement. For a few years now, I've been dealing with dry, breaking hair due to hormonal post-menopausal changes plus the fact that my hair is lightened. (I only chose to lighten it because of the weird way grey was appearing in my brunette hair -it was just easier to go lighter than to keep dying it dark.)  Anyway, due to multiple issues, there was lots of dryness and breaking. So I was feeling a little bit sad about it, my hair looked like straw, and people close to me had know trouble letting me know about it. I tried NUMEROUS products and treatments but nothing worked. The sales rep at Sally Beauty Beauty (thank you sales lady at the Summerville, SC Sally Beauty Supply) recommended this product and also Aphogee Two-step Protein Treatment. Both of them together have been the only thing that have worked for me so far. My hair looks A LOT better-not perfect yet, not like when I was young when it had that glossy natural swing to it, but lots better. Not like straw any more. You can get both this product and the Aphogee on Amazon if Sally Beauty isn't near you. I get it when I can wherever it's available. In my area, Sally is better priced for the Hask, but more expensive on the Aphogee. Can't wait to see my hair growth! I'll be using this under my wigs Like Have thin hair problems, is terrible !

I gave one bottle to a relative, and opened and used my new bottle about a week later. It seemed more liquidy than I recall the previous bottle had been, but it seemed to do the same job so I blew it off.  A few months later I happened to visit the relative to whom I gave a bottle., so I tested hers. Much thicker consistency! So word to the wise: if you open one of these bottles and the shampoo feels somewhat water, like the consistency of liquid dish soap, send it back and complain.  The real stuff is a little thicker than liquid hand soap, if that helps. I am a woman in my 40's dealing with hair thinning, desperately trying to find something to slow down (or please stop) my hair loss.I am beyond the hope that something can help me re-grow what I've lost; I just want to keep what I have left on my head! I bought this shampoo awhile ago, but am reviewing it now because I just finished up the bottle. When I originally got the shampoo, I tried it but was not impressed, so I put it aside to try another shampoo that I had purchased from Amazon to help with hair loss (that shampoo did not work either!). I came back to this shampoo to give it another try--maybe I hadn't given it a fair shot. The first thing I noticed about this shampoo is how well it lathers, which is good, except, is it? My understanding is that good lather=harsh detergents, which I know my hair does not need. Then when I am done rinsing it out, my hair feels completely dry (there is a reason people use the term straw-like--it's a perfect description) and unbelievably tangled, which puzzles me given some of the ingredients in this shampoo: argan oil, aloe vera, jojoba oil, coconut oil... I follow up with a conditioner which allows me to get a comb through my hair without yanking it all out. I guess my hope was that this shampoo would nourish my hair and scalp so well that my hair would thrive and my hair fall would cease! Didn't happen. I know that it does take some time for things to work, but I gave this shampoo more than a month to help slow down the hair loss, and I had just as much coming out by the end of the bottle as I did at the start of the bottle. So if you are in search of the perfect shampoo, my advice would be to keep looking! Update:  I have used this product for about a month and it is still working very well.I have thinning hair and bought this shampoo based on a recommendation. My hair used to move in just a slight breeze however after using this shampoo for a month it feels and looks a lot thicker. My wife has also commented many times that my hair looks and feels much thicker.A few notes: It is a liquid so it is fairly runny like a normal shampoo however it does lather well like a conditioner.  Also, I leave it in during a shower like I would a conditioner and after a couple of minutes it soaks into my hair/head. I don't use the conditioner by the same brand since I use this like I would a conditioner.Another note: The 2nd ingredient is Biotin compared to most other shampoos which contain a lot of other stuff first. I think that makes this shampoo a much better product then most other choices. I searched for a GOOD, organic and natural biotin-containing shampoo, and this is what I bought. I take biotin (geltabs) internally (5k mcg per day), and 'you are what you eat', so a diet high in protein with biotin supplements has given me glorious hair... thick and curly and long and strong... BUT I wanted a shampoo to really up the ante and give me the softest, most luxurious hair ever, because I'm going to donate all 20 inches of it in March!The shampoo itself is rather gel-like; you only need a little bit, it goes a long way. It smells marvelous and feels great on the hair. Rinses very clean. My hair is shiny and soft, and knowing there is biotin in it makes me very happy! It is a GREAT price and a huge bottle, too! I only shampoo twice a week, so we'll see how it goes - but so far I am quite impressed, with the texture, the ingredients, the price, the feel and smell, and the results. I am african american/american indian/white. I purchased this because of the reviews after suffering a medical condition, I lost a lot of hair; it broke off from the root and broke off in small pieces. My doctor said I ""broke the hair growth cycle."" I lost about 4 inches of hair on one side of my hair, which is normally mid-back length.  It took about 3 washes (once/week) for my hair to stop breaking and shedding.  After 5 weeks, my hair is back on track again.  I am growing it out natural now, and keeping the permed hair, and trim it myself.  My goalnow is lower back length...I also use Moroccanoil products right after this shampoo because it can make my hair feel dry and stripped, but the Moroccanoil products puts all the moisture and life back into it right away.  I have made this part of my hair care regimen. Finding a product that works well for fine hair can be tricky but this one does the job for my fine wavy hair. I have used this product off and on for years now and like it very much.  Not all natural shampoos create a lather but this one does (a medium amount).  While it's a great product, I'm still searching for the perfect shampoo, so 4 stars.  I do recommend it and think it's worth a try.  It's nice to add extra essential oils to this shampoo for the extra boost.  I It seems that the other reviewers are particularly happy about its anti-dandruff properties. I don't have dandruff in the first place.I started using the shampoo because my brother had it when I visited him. He said it was good for keeping his hair thicker. I bought some to use at home, and I do believe it helps. Because it works on the scalp and the hair, it helps the scalp be a healthy place for hair to keep root, and the shampoo helps my long hair keep healthy all along the shaft.My husband started using it too. Eventually, the shop we bought it from locally stopped carrying it. Now we buy it several bottles at a time, online. It is a good product at a good price.The scent is not syrupy or perfumy. Instead it is a not-sweet, mildly minty scent (part of the scalp invigoration formula, perhaps?) I highly recommend it for for both men and women.",2,2,0

One at the base to prevent it from unraveling and then three at reach end to stretch the strands. As I recall, only two were damaged/unusable. These hair clips don't pull or pull your hair, like the old kind we're all used to using. My wet hair in 2.5 inch rollers stayed secure for 5 hours, when I removed them easily. I was skeptical before buying, since bad experiences years ago had my hair bring butchered when removing them. Totally worth the Low price! Many of the prongs don't line up and these clips pull hair.  Bought to use as root lifters for volume while my hair dries.  Better options out there - would prefer mini claw clips for this purpose. Lots of good hair clips . They will do the job well I needed these for my locs, especially since I'm just starting out. They got the job done, and they did it well! Great sturdy little clips. I use them mostly as bases for homemade hair flowers (both for retro pin-up looks and also for Mexican folklorico hairstyles) and they haven't failed me yet. I just sandwich the top tongue between two pieces of felt as a base and attach the flowers to the base. They can take a surprisingly big arrangement without flipping in the hair.For more practical beautiful use I find them just okay. I have naturally curly hair so generally when I use them it's to loosely pile my wet hair on my head to let the curls dry without being weighed down by gravity. They hold like the dickens, which I love, but it's hard to remove them without getting a few strands of hair caught in the spring. I suppose if you did really neat, very gelled down pin curls it would be okay, but I'm still not sold.They work fine for foam rollers, though not hot rollers (obviously) and they're too short for most finger waves (which is fine, but if you want to do finger waves, get longer clips) but overall they're solid clips that have stood up pretty well and I'd buy them again if I ran out.",5,5,0

It allows you to style your hair with much more versatility, while leaving out the sticky, crunchy feeling that comes with using hair gel. Just a tiny bit of cream holds my hair in place all day, and it rinses off easily at night.As a male with hair that is starting to thin, it allows me to add volume to my hair and helps to hide the thinning to some degree. This is a great improvement over my old hair gel, which previously made my thinning hair much more noticeable!I don't see myself buying a different hair styling product any time soon. Excellent product! The stylist who was working on my hair at a local salon first introduced me to this product about 8 years ago, and I have not purchased any other styling product since!FYI for those who have been using the solid blue bottle (similar to the color of the star on this one), this is the exact same thing.  Just in a new bottle!Just as a quick note, one of these tubes easily lasts me at least a year due to the small amount that is needed each use, so don't be scared off by the price!  I'm sure this can vary based on hair length so as a point of reference, I usually get my hair cut once a month now at about a ""6"" length.Prior to using this product, I had been using the LA Looks XTreme hair gel for several years prior, and I can say that this product is superior in almost every way.This cream is very different in that it does not leave your hair looking shiny and wet.  It allows you to style your hair with much more versatility, while leaving out the sticky, crunchy feeling that comes with using hair gel.  Just a tiny bit of cream holds my hair in place all day, and it rinses off easily at night.As a male with hair that is starting to thin, it allows me to add volume to my hair and helps to hide the thinning to some degree.  This is a great improvement over my old hair gel, which previously made my thinning hair much more noticeable!I don't see myself buying a different hair styling product any time soon.  Excellent product! When I finally find a product that I can successfully use on my fine, thinning midlength hair, I need to write a review.  I guess due to genenics and after extreme dieting, my hair has taken a hit.  It's very lifeless, fragile and breaks easy.  On a side note, I just returned four expensive products back to Ulta that did nothing to help thicken my hair..  I have found success using the hair gel called andalou naturals sunflower and citrus (that I buy off of Amazon), but after I blow dry my hair with this product, I just need something to give it some more lift and volume.  This product knocks it out of the ball park.  I was so pleasantly surprised with the results that I decided to get on here and write a review.  The funny thing is, I have never seen this product sold anywhere, after combing Amazon looking for hair defintion creams, this popped up.  I thought, what do I have to lose, if it doen't work out, I'll just return it.  Very happy to say, this is a keeper!  Also, I feel like you get a lot of product for the money.  I may branch out and try the other items in the line to see if I can find some new products that work for me. Back then the packaging was different and easier. The stuff was a lot easier to work with, and made for a stiffer hold. But now it seems that you need a lot more to get to the same hair. But overall I like this, and most importantly, I notice less hair falling out than other products. I use a little at a time to build up the texture to hold my very short hair styled. I tried this for the first time and really like it.  I have very straight, thick short hair and this product works very well in my hair.",1,3,-2

Decent hold, undetectable It holds a medium healthy looking hold I have very thin, limp hair. After styling I use about 1/2 tsp of this, emulsify it with my fingers, and run it through my hair. Voilà! Thicker hair full of volume and lift! And you can regenerate it throughout the day by dampening your fingers and running them through. It’s great! It lasts forever. Product meets expectations . I've used a lot of different hair gels over the past 30 years and even a few hair sprays back in the 80's, do they even make Stiff Stuff anymore?  Unlike the aforementioned spray, this forming cream is one of the best products I've ever used.  My last personal favorite was the now discontinued Burt's Bees natural hair gel for men.  It worked well but simply didn't last and my last tube was just about gone when I looked for a replacement.  The forming cream, while not being touted as ""natural"" works far better than the Burt's Bees gel or any other gel for that matter.Pros:-All day/night hold with no crispy hair feeling.  I was shocked when I woke up the next morning and my hair looked fine.-All day/night healthy shine.  I like my short hair to have a bit of a shine, not grease shine but enough to help darken up my hair.  Previous gels eventually looked dry or like I wasn't wearing anything.-No flaking so far.  I'm still experimenting with how much product is needed.  So far a very small amount goes a LONG way.  I can only describe it like old shoe polish.  Wipe your finger over the product, wet your hands and product, work through your hair.  If you need more wipe and repeat.Cons:-Hard to say this is a con but the smell is a bit strong at first.  You get used to it and my wife didn't mind.  It is a musky smell that isn't overbearing or harsh but is definitely not typical of hair products I've used before. I have medium-long hair that's also pretty thick, so its been a challenge finding something that will keep my hair in-place and get rid of the friz, while still not BLATANTLY LOOKING like I have something in my hair. First I tried hair gel but it flaked off disgustingly after it dried and just gave me an annoying spike look. Then I tried mousse and that didn't flake but it still dried in a way I didn't like and made my hair look dull.Now I got this stuff and wow, this stuff does what I've been wanting. Just put a tiny pea-sized amount in your hands when your hair is only slightly damp and style like you want. It keeps even my thick hair in the basic shape I want with that small amount. It also doesn't harden when it dries so it gives an awesome natural, ""out-of-the-shower"" look for several hours (as in 7 or 8 hours). The shine is only slightly shinier than what the American Crew Shampoo and Conditioner gives me. It all washes out really easy in the shower when you're done.If you do want to do spikes just put it in the hair when it's still really damp after a towel dry.Just be deliberate when you put it in your hair. This is not a product where you put it in your hair, THEN style. You have to style while you put it in, as it won't let you run your hands easily through your hair once its in. For some reason the container was smaller than I expected for $12.. but my husband really likes this product and doesn’t have to use much at a time for it to work well and it holds all day. I think (hope) it will last him longer than I originally expected. I was using",3,4,-1

Cooling Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Conditioning Rosemary, Strengthens, Helps Dry Flaking Scalp, Sulfate Free, Paraben Free (Pack of 3)","This is the only conditoner that does not make my fine hair look limp or flat after using.  It is a lovely smelling product and after using it, my fine hair actually gets a nice volume effect.  Other conditioners would leave my hair looking flat and I would comb out all my knots with the conditioner and then wash it out and then re-shampoo (which is stupid) just to avoid the usual flat and limp look most conditioners would leave. Not this product...my hair feels clean and lush, no flatness and I can just conditon and go.  Highly recoomended if you have fine hair. scent is light -- I'm a fan of Giovanni conditioners; I've been using the Direct Leave-In and Deeper Moisture for a little over a year now.  I've had dry, itchy scalp for a few years, so I decided to give the Giovanni Tea Tree Oil a try.  I'm so glad I did!  This conditioner has been wonderful and has relieved me of the dry, flaky itchies.  I concentrate this particular conditioner on my scalp and make sure to let it sit for about 5-10min. to allow the tea tree to work, then I rinse.  I started out with one bottle, and I just  reordered the 3-bottle deal.  Giovanni conditioners are smooth and creamy, offering great slip for comb-outs followed by soft moisturized hair. My fiancé and I LOVE this shampoo & conditioner. Whenever I have a headache I shower and use this shampoo it almost always relives my headaches, (which I get frequently). I never knew shampoo could make your head tingle. We used to buy it at Walmart, but it's pretty pricey 8 Oz for 7/8$. here we get three bottles for under $20. And I don't have to travel out of town to get it.My only wish is, I wish they came in different sizes. I have very thick long hair, which requires lots of conditioner, so we go through quite a bit of it. But I still highly recommend it. My hair is prone to being frizzy and while there are a number of conditioners that help to tame it on those days, I really like the fact that this stuff doesn't have the parabens that most others use as preservatives.As an added bonus, the tea tree oil helps to keep dandruff under control. It won't work on any serious dandruff but if you sometimes have mild problems, this and the shampoo both help.I had originally purchased this stuff as a three pack from Costco which gave me three bottles (only one of which is conditioner) for quite a bit less than I see it for anywhere else. I buy additional conditioner on amazon to balance things out. I've lived in the midwest off and on over the past decade, and have always struggled to find haircare products that don't leave my hair a total frizzball in the winter. The dry air and cold absolutely destroys my hair. I bought this conditioner on a whim about a month ago and have made it through some pretty bad weather & wind with my hair intact. I tend to leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes, and my hair is soft, bouncy, and shiny after every wash. The smell is delicious & a great wakeup in the morning. I was a little nervous about buying this in bulk without trying it first, but I took a chance and am so glad I did! The product is great. I only received 1 bottle instead of 3 as advertised. I first discovered this shampoo and conditioner elsewhere and paid double the price that I paid on Amazon.  If you haven't used Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner let me recommend it highly.  I am of a certain age and my hair was dull, lifeless and seemed to be falling out by the handful.  Not anymore.  This product is indeed the holy grail of hair products.  My hair is shiny, bouncy and thicker than before I begain using it.  Don't let the price fool you.  It's worth far more than it sells for and I did in fact pay far more until I found it here.",1,2,-1

My hair feels so soft after I use it. I am African American with relaxed hair that is thinning in the crown area, due to medications.I recently cut my shoulder length hair to about 2"" (Halle Berry cut). My thinning area really shows now. But, I love my cut. So, I went online looking for a solution. I  felt encouraged after reading the reviews on this line of products.I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, serum and hair spray.Upon arrival, I used the hair spray. I saw no difference in my thinning hair. A few days later, I decided to wash my hair and try the other products. My expectations were low, after seeing no results from the hairspray. Boy! Was I surprised.After shampooing, conditioning, and using the serum, my hair felt thicker. It was also smooth, soft and shiny. I couldn't believe it. After allowing my hair to air dry, I applied DermMatch to the thinning areas in the crown. I combed the DermMatch through my hair until my hair was completely dry. Using a paddle brush, I brushed my hair thoroughly to remove any excess DermMatch. I then flat ironed my hair. I finished with the hairspray. My hair looked amazing. It looked like I had just stepped out of a salon. It was so full, shiny and healthy looking. I then applied a small amount of Enjoy smooth and shine to add more sheen. Although my hair felt a little stiff from the spray, it really wasn't. My paddle brush and comb ran easily through my hair.Before bedtime, I put a few of the foam rollers that are wrapped with satin in the crown area. When I removed them the next morning, I could not believe how my hair had curled. My hair is normally hard to curl even when I use setting lotion. I had rolled my hair dry and got curl and body. I brushed out the curl, added a little more Enjoy smooth and shine and the hairspray. Voila! I couldn't believe the results. It looked as if I had grown more hair overnight.This line of products seem to work in synergy. So, results are best when shampoo, conditioner, serum and hairspray are used together.I love that the products have little to no scent. They just leave my hair smelling clean and fresh.I am very very pleased with this product line.***UPDATE***I must revise my review of this product line. I forgot to research if the products were sulfate free. My bad! They are not. I have a keratin treatment in my hair and sulfates would strip it. Thankfully, I only used the products once.I have seen a great improvement in the condition of my hair since discontinuing the use of shampoos containing sulfates. My hair stopped shedding.So, I will no longer use any of these products, since they work in synergy.I think I'll try RegenePure products that are sulfate free and also claim to stimulate hair growth.I've also discontinued the use of DermMatch, because I am tired of it getting under my fingernails each time I massage my scalp. Great Product excellent  delivery Looking forward to doing More Business  with you Adds fullness and body to my hair, just like it said it would.  It is not a thick conditioner, and easy to rinse out. I would buy it again I'm 66 and my hair is thinning.  You can't see my scalp yet, but it is getting there and in places my hair wants to naturally part, yes, you can see my scalp.  A few years ago I purchased the shampoo and was not impressed.  This time I went all out and purchased the shampoo, the conditioner and the root spray.You CANNOT see my scalp even on the areas that want to part naturally, it's covered.  I really am impressed and realize buying all three products is probably what did it.  I blew dried my hair and shall put some curls in it with a curling iron.I will continue using these three products.  I'm just an Amazon customer and rely on the reviews.  Please know that this may not work for you, but it did for me and I love it.I'm leaving the same review on all three products.  I think that's what has worked, at least for me, using all three products. Have always had fine hair, once upon a time blond, now blond/brown/gray. I keeps my hair pretty short and don’t mind the receded hairline mostly because I’m pretty sure from looking at my uncles, there will be likely no bald spot. However, thin fine hair can leave you showing scalp when your hair is as short as mine. So I’ve tried a few different systems for keeping hair looking thicker. This system (shampoo, conditioner, leave-in product) provides the most visual thickness that I can tell. One thing: many reviewers of these products get upset when their hair continues to fall out or not regrow. That is not what thickening products are for. They simply make what you have look fuller and theoretically less likely to break. This conditioner makes the tangles fall out when I rinse my hair and doesn't leave any residue to weigh down my fine, thin hair.  This is easily my 3rd or 4th bottle.  Doesn't disappoint. This shampoo makes my thin and limp hair feel thicker and fuller.  I have used a lot of different shampoos to thicken my hair and this one I like the best.",2,3,-1

The item arrived on time, in excellent condition, and at the right price. Thank you I love this, leaves my hair, so soft and clean feeling doesn’t leave residue I have extremely coarse, dry and frizzy hair. (Thanks Mom 😭.)  I've been using the detangler since the early 90's and it breaks right through my terrible tangles and matted hair. Before blow drying, I add a light amount of the Detangler to leave in. I wouldn't be able to get through the drying process if I didn't, as my hair tangles quickly and easily. It causes a fair amount of breakage. While I wish the Detangler was enough to really moisturize and relieve frizz, it isn't for my awful hair. I also add a pomade or oil because my hair is so porous it absorbs everything right away. For you lucky folks that have normal hair, it works beautifully. Pour a quarter size amount into your palms, apply it to wet hair before blow drying and enjoy healthy looking and feeling hair. I have very fine hair that tangles easily even after conditioner. With the Detangler, I skip conditioner and just use this on my ends.  Works very well for me ! Alone this is not soft but when I add it to my normal conditioner it is excellent. I mistakenly bought the wrong product but it does the job. To me, it has an overwhelming floral smell. Like grannies old perfume that makes you choke on in church! Lol Purchased this product because I have very wavy, coarse, out of control hair.  I find this product over softens my hair and leaves it limp and lifeless.  I have used it a number of times, using less product and leaving it on for shorter periods, only to get the same results. I think this would work better for folks with coily hair, as opposed to wavy hair. It’s the only product that gets tangles out of hair and you can really comb through it well .I’ve used Paul Mitchell many years and stand by their products",1,2,-1

I like the light coconut scent and it’s gentle but good for getting hair squeaky-clean.This bottle is quite large and unwieldy for keeping in the shower, but per ounce it’s much less money, so I bought a small squeeze bottle and refill it once a month.Unfortunately the last time I ordered, although the big bottle was inside a plastic box and more or less cushioned by airbags, it managed to work the cap loose and escaped the bag, leaking all over the inside of the box which got soaked with shampoo. (See photo) I called customer service and was instructed to throw the whole thing away. They’re sending me a replacement free of charge,  but I feel bad about the waste, which appears to be the fault of the manufacturer, because of an inadequate seal inside the cap. Shipping can be especially rough on a single, heavy item like this, as  there’s no good way to keep the bottle upright. So be prepared. Paul Mitchell never disappoints. We love this shampoo in our house. Love to wash my hair with this. Delivered with care, excellent product. I love the coconut scent of this shampoo!

About 3 years ago my hairdresser (whom I used to see infrequently) washed my hair with Nexxus once and I fell in love with the smell, so I decided to buy some shampoo and conditioner.  Eventually I discovered Nexxus Emergencee Restorative Strength Conditioning Treatment and was using it for about 2 years with what I thought were decent results. (until I found this!) I have developed a system and I truly believe that this Reconstructor is the real deal!I use this product in conjuction with so many other Nexxus products and I'll give you a run down of everything I do below.  I will warn all you readers, though about each product.  Be prepared; this is a long review, but informative.Nexxus Therappe Shampoo - It smells great and I really have no complaints.  I havent used any other Nexxus Shampoo, so I dont have much to compare it to.Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment - This is awesome!  I have tried other Nexxus conditioners (Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner, Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner, and Nexxus Hyrda Sleek Silken Smoothing Conditioner) But none compare to the moisturizing power this stuff has.Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Crème - At first this seemed like the answer to my split-end prayers.  It truly, truly does repair split ends.  However, it took my curly/wavy hair (think Halle Berry in Their Eyes Were Watching God movie) to BONE STRAIGHT hair.  Seriously, you cannot find half a curl in my hair.  Obviously, it changes the structure of your hair when it binds the split ends, so be warned if you have curly hair this may very well change your hair's structure.  Since it worked so well for me, I continue to use it only on my ends while I allow my curls to grow back.  For my African American readers: It looks like a perm is growing out of my head; curly/wavy at the roots and straight on the ends.  I press my roots and flat iron my hair for work anyway so I dont look too funny!Now the reason why you are here: Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor - Having used Nexxus Emergencee reconstructor I am familiar with Protein Treatments and the effects on my hair.  Let me be frank, this blows other Reconstructors clear out of the water.  I've used (stinky) Aphogee Keratin Reconstructor and it doesnt even compare.  I learned the hard way that too much protein (as this product is super strength and can easily deliver) will cause your hair to break.  After just 2 applications of this product on my entire head - it caused my edges to break off!  That is how strong this is.  Like I said previously, I had been using Emergencee for 2 years and had never had any breakage, but just 2 applications of this stuff and my hair was looking very rough around my edges.  I should mention also, that during my first 2 applications of this product I left it on for 30 minutes at a time, once a week.  The directions recommend just 10 minutes every 2 weeks.  I stopped applying it to my edges and they recovered in just 2 weeks or so.  All in all, as long as you dont overdo it you will see great results.  If you're not asleep yet, keep reading to learn about the steps I take every week to acheive really healthy hair.1.  Wash my hair with Nexxus Therappe Shampoo2.  Allow my hair to air dry until it is only slightly damp and apply Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Crème and leave it in overnight.3.  Wash out the Promend and apply Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor on my entire head (except my edges).  Cover with a shower cap and leave on for 10-15 minutes.4.  Wash out the reconstructor and apply Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment to slightly damp hair.  Cover with a shower cap for about an hour (while I clean my bathroom or do laundry or something domestic)5.  Rinse out the conditioner and allow my hair to air dry naturally.6.  Heat Style my hair:  Press the roots and edges and use an electric flat iron to straighen my hair.The results:After a day and a half (EVERY WEEKEND!!!) of repeating this process, my hair is probably the shiniest and bounciest hair you will ever see. It is so soft and healthy, you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all.  As a black woman it feels great when non-black people compliment me on my hair.  Not any of those well-meaning, yet, condesceding remarks such as, ""Your hair is so cool"" or ""Wow, I wish my hair could be like that""  I get, ""Wow, your hair is so pretty"" and ""How do you get your hair so soft?""  Seriously, I have shared my procedure with all my friends and family.  Although they dont have the dedication or income to buy all the above mentioned products, they have seen some results.UPDATE: 9/6/12After doing some extensive research, brought on from reading The Science of Black Hair by Audrey Davis-Sivasothy.  I've realized that although my hair appeared very healthy, it was suffering from too much protein.  This product has large amounts of protein and although that's great for your hair, too much is obviously a bad thing.  I've learned what the warning signs are for too much protein and I had to come back and share this with you readers:1.  Protein is supposed to bond with your hair.  While you are using this treatment this should make your hair hard (with or without heat).  If your hair is still soft, WHILE THIS PRODUCT IS ON YOUR HAIR, after a reasonable amount of time, it's not binding - That's enough protein!!2.  Too much protein causes your hair to become hard and brittle.  No matter how much conditioner, moisturizer, or oil you put on your hair.  If it's still hard or crunchy or breaks when you barely touch it while dry - That's enough protein!!3.  When you start to see breakage, that's the final straw!  You will see breakage mostly at the roots (as this is the healthiest hair on your head since its the newest).  Your roots are already strong and dont really need that much protein.  If you see breakage at your roots or very close to your scalp - That's enough protein!!If you've got too much protein be sure to clarify your hair and give it some time to recover from the protein treatments.Good luck to all! If you’re reading all these reviews and thinking it all sounds too good to be true, I hear you - I was doing the same thing before I ordered it.  I was really skeptical.  This stuff is pricey, and lots of products claim to be amazing for really damaged hair.  I’ve tried tons of different products over the years, from all different lines.  And none of them lived up to their claims.Though this one was expensive, I figured I’d give it a try - and I planned to write a scathing review debunking all the hype once I proved it was just like all the other products out there claiming to “save” my dry hair.  I would save some other gullible soul from making the same expensive error I did.Here’s the deal: I have bleached, dyed, platinum blond hair (think P!nk the singer - like hers).  It’s cut in a short pixie with long layers on top and long bangs, and the bottom two inches of hair on the longer pieces is always fried beyond belief - even though I condition with deep conditioner regularly.  The issue is caused by getting my hair cut, bleached, and colored every four weeks, plus I blow dry and use a flat iron on the long pieces to tame volume and keep myself from resembling Lyle Lovett (my hair is naturally curly).  You can imagine how dry the ends get!Ok, so now you get the picture.  The product arrived, and some had leaked out during shipping.  Well that’s money wasted, but fortunately it wasn’t much. It was VERY sticky when I tried to wipe it off of the bottle though!  Yikes!  What is this stuff???  And the bottle isn’t all that large for what I had to pay.  Hmmm.  Grumble, grumble, grumble, bet this stuff won’t work, grumble some more...then fast forward to my first use of the product.  I applied it to clean wet hair in the shower, and covered with a plastic shower cap.  Went about my business in the shower for about 10 minutes, then rinsed out the Nexxus, and followed with shampoo and conditioner (different brands, not theirs - so save yourself some money there).  Applied a little Agadir argan oil while the hair was damp, then blew it dry and used the flat iron as usual.  I WAS AMAZED.  Literally ZERO crispy ends!  Hair was soft and shiny, from root to tip.  It feels like my hair did before I cut it and started bleaching and coloring it every four weeks.  The instructions say to use only once every two weeks, so I’ll see how my hair does waiting that long to use again.  Supposedly it makes your hair stronger with each use.  But I will definitely keep using this - it’s truly a hair saver!  Now if only they could drop the price some...but even if they don’t, I’ll keep buying it, it works that well.Long story short - if you’re skeptical about the claims this stuff makes, give it a try.  It certainly lived up to the claims when I used it on my fried hair!",1,1,0

I have been taking them for three days, so, I will get back with you in a month to let you know what they have done (effectually). I have read where they have the ability to make you ""feel sick"" and I know why. First, when you open the bottle, there is the strong vitamin smell. Judging from the list of ingredients, I believe you can actually get away with taking these as an actual vitamin. It has MS and biotin (2000 per 2) which I thought was cool. One thing I need to point out: I have been taking bamboo and biotin, sometimes together. What I have found is that, being that I am premenopausal, it took about two months for me to actually see results. The bamboo, or even the biotin, will do the trick. I believe the bamboo makes it grow, yes, but the biotin takes a minute because it seems to ""fill in"" if you understand what I mean. One other thing, this Groganics vitamin is huge, which is another reason I believe it can make you nauseous, but, especially on an empty stomach. It makes me nauseous...Also, it is VERY potent, in that it begins to make you feel that way in less than thirty minutes. I say do not take on an empty stomach. It is a large yellow/gold caplet. It is big because, I believe, if you take two, that will be the reason for you to have great growth. I say give it a chance. It acts like any other vitamin in that you should not take it on an empty stomach. These pills have no choice but to help your hair..Yes, biotin breaks me out, however, I believe it does in small quantities...I will give you an update in a month or if I notice anything differently. The older I get I have noticed that my hair is thin and very brittle. It was constantly falling out. I used groganics a few years ago and it worked wonders. My hair was thick and healthy. Unfortunately I stopped using it and over time I  had this issue again. I started back using groganics about 3 weeks ago and I have noticed a huge difference. This is truly worth the purchase.  They also sell it at the beauty supply store. I Love Groganics! I had been using their whole line of products for a couple of years now. I am on a lot of prescription medications for various health conditions, and my hair took a beating.  The groganics line has been more then a blessing of restoring my hair and keeping it healthy.  I just recently tried the Vitamins.  I did not take 2 a day as stated but one a day, and it worked just fine.  My hair has been growing like crazy.  I actually started these vitamins at the same time I got my hair braided, and am having a fit as I am used to getting at least 2 months of wear out of braids.  Yet with taking these vitamins I barely made it a month with not just needing a touch up but my whole head redone.  BIttersweet! As I am ecstatic my hair is rapidly growing - I am not happy about having to pay out more money so quickly as well as sit another 6 hours to get a head full of braids so quickly. :-)  But I will take it!! I have been taking these vitamins since 12/24/11. I started off taking two per day but.... I noticed my urine was like a ""Neon"" yellow. When I read all the reviews I never once heard anyone talk about this in their review of this product. It changes the color of your urine. Because of this I started taking only one per day and in over 2 weeks I have at least one inch of new growth, so I know it works. I was just concerned with the color of my urine. When I googled Bright yellow urine, I found out that it is from ingesting a high amount of vitamin B, which this product has plenty of. It also stated that the body will only absorb what it needs and the rest is discarded through the urine which makes the color almost a fluoresant/neon yellow color. So for all of you who may have noticed this slight missing detail from other reviews, now you know. I will update you on how I am doing with only taking one pill per day instead of the 2 in about a month. The Groganics DHT Vitamins really works!  I have been dealing with severely thinning hair for the past 10 years.  During that time I've had no success with the many products and programs to combat this problem such as Rogaine, Organic Root Stimulator, The Hair Club, Glover's, Doo Gro, along with a few other products.  When Groganics was suggested I almost turned it down, but I thought to myself, what did I have to lose?  So I tried it.I was given samples of Groganics Hair Gro n Wild DHT Blocker System.  This product began working immediately, I witnessed hair growth within the first week of use.  I was so impressed with the results, I also purchased the Groganics DHT 2-A-Day hair vitamins. Currently, all of my thinning and bald areas have been replaced with hair growth.  This product has given me back my hair. I was beginning to believe this would never happen.  Thank God, I did not give up!",1,4,-3

AVEDA products are one of the few lines that I can use and feel confident that I will not have an allergenic reaction from it.  However, now that I have an appreciable amount of grey/white hair, I find that the white hair picks up the BLUE (REALLY BLUE!) in the color conditioner, so I have some bright blue streaks (which should be white!), so the brown hair left is on it's own and I am using Blue Malva exclusively.(BTW, some people have said they love the blue streaks and I should go back to what I was using!) Update: You know that thing? That thing where you don't feel your hair looks quite right but you think it's 'just you' being picky ...? And then one day you are in a really bright lighted bathroom, look in the mirror, and you see the weird stripes and uneven or so even across sections it doesn't look 'natural' and there are different colors of your highlights but not in a good way? And then you know it's not 'just you' .... Yeah.I asked for barely there highlights concentrating mostly on the mid-to-ends, and I ended up with all over highlights that showed stripes and unevenness--the attempt to 'fix' it over nearly a year of seeing my stylist didn't fair well either and cost me money I don't have to waste. Sigh. When will I learn?  (No stylist will ever match Jasmine at the Aveda salon I used to go to--now she knew color! She moved away - *sob*). This last visit to my stylist,  I waited 6 weeks for my hair to calm down (and to see if I could get used to it-nope), then purchased this Clove conditioner again.What I did to tone down the stripey uneven highlights but leave some lighter ends: I sectioned my dry hair and put conditioning mask all over the ends from my ears down then I put a stretchy-band at the top of where I conditioned and made sure my ends were tucked into the band. I then applied the Clove conditioner all on the rest of my dry hair, from roots to just at the top of where the hair was banded, leaving the bottom portion without the clove conditioner. I left it on 5 minute, got in the shower, took off the bands, and very thoroughly rinsed my hair, towel and then blew dry my hair.It worked! I see some toned down subtle highlights at the top and the mid-to ends have that lighter quality that  I wanted and asked for. I'll do this from time to time until either my hair just absorbs enough color to make it 'stick' and give it time to let my hair grow out so the highlights grow out.I applied it at the bathroom sink so I could better see and control what I was doing. The conditioner is thick so it's not drippy.I have naturally medium to dark brown hair with a bit of grey (not much). Your results may vary but I am happy with my result. And unless Jasmine ever moves back to the mountains, no more highlights for me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review:I used this years ago and loved it just to make my then-short dark hair a little richer in color. I used to leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes before washing away and like the results.This time I bought it to cover or to tone down some highlights I had put in my collar-bone length hair where the stylist got them just a little too light for me. She first toned them down at the salon but after a few days the color began to fade out on the highlights.This Clove conditioner does tone them so the highlights have a more caramel brown over my dark hair rather than more blonde. Make my hair look much better.I shampoo, then add a little Clove conditioner—sometimes I mix it with my regular conditioner. I let it sit anywhere from 2 minutes to 5 minutes, then thoroughly rinse. I will add that even when I mix it with a little of my regular conditioner, my hair is still tangled and hard to brush through when wet/damp—adding a little bit more regular conditioner could help with that. I have super baby fine hair that tangles easily so your results may be different from mine.I wish the scent smelled like cloves! Aveda hair products usually smell so spicy and nice, but this doesn’t quite smell as nice as the others. Maybe because of the color added to it just won’t allow for that. It doesn’t smell bad at all, just not as nice as the other Aveda products I use.I use this from once a week to a couple of times a week. It’s gentle on my hair and really does tone down those highlights!Aveda products are not cheap, but they are worth it. And this is a huge bottle of conditioner that will last me a very long time. I have to use very little to get the results I want.This doesn’t make my hair turn a weird reddish color either. And I like that it washes away. I wouldn’t over-use it or leave it on too long for the results I want to achieve and because I’d not want it to build up in my hair too much.If you want to add a little richness to your hair, or tone down or cover some too-light highlights, then this is a good color conditioner to try.I  hope my review helped you today. This color correcting conditioner has been working great for my needs!  My usual hair stylist was out sick, and someone else from the salon filled in for my appointment with her.  Although she left instructions, somehow my face-framing highlights ended up super blonde instead of just one shade lighter than my natural brown hair (for reference, my natural hair is about a 5N, and I usually get 6N highlights, but the stylist did 9N).  I was told my only option would be to go back to the salon every 3 weeks to get a toner or glaze to darken them.  Instead, I remembered this conditioner I used years ago to correct an uneven box dye my roommate did on my hair in college (we did not know what we were doing).In my hand, this conditioner looks just a tad darker than my natural hair, but I haven't noticed it darkening the rest of my hair, only the highlights.  The instructions say to leave on for 2-5 minutes, so my first use I left it on for 2 minutes.  The highlights were still slightly lighter than I wanted but much improved!  And after the second use they were right where I wanted them.  I will continue to use this conditioner every few washes to maintain the darker color.  Be sure to rinse your hands as soon as you've applied the conditioner, as it can stain!  After a few weeks, I may go back to the salon and try to get the highlights fixed, but they were hesitant to do that immediately for fear of damaging my hair.  Or maybe I'll just save my money.  Either way, I have this conditioner to tide me over.  It's not as moisturizing as I'd like, but my hair is shiny and soft when dry.  And I can still alternate use with my usual conditioner.  Thank you Aveda! So I know this clearly says don't use it on blonde hair, but I did it anyways. And guess what, it came out amazing! I actually mixed this half and half with the Clove color, because my hair was a neutral color (not too ashy and not too warm) and I didn't want it to go one way or another and I didn't need to cancel out a lot of one tone. Anyways, like I said I mixed 50% Clove and 50% Black Malva and then halved that with just some of my regular conditioner because my blonde processed hair was going to take the color more so than virgin hair or darker hair. I applied it all over with my hands then brushed it through with my hairbrush. I left it on for only about 5 minutes after it was brushed through and it came out great! This is exactly the brown I was looking for without dying with harsh dyes.My advice for those applying this to blonde: Choose which color to use based on your current color. If your blonde is very brassy/yellow you may need only the Black Malva. If your blonde is very ashy and even greenish, you should probably just use the Clove. DON'T just apply either of them directly you your hair, especially dry (unless you're trying to go really dark)! Blonde will take the colors much faster and you will end up dark very quickly, especially if you are a fake blonde and your hair is over processed. Mix the Aveda with a regular conditioner and apply to your hair while it's wet. Remember, you can always put more in after if you want a darker color, but you're going to be washing your hair for a while trying to get it lighter if you go too dark. I have used this product for many years.  I am not sure it does anything so it has just become a habit.  It is also much more expensive.  Maybe it is not doing anything for my hair",3,4,-1

I got my hair today and yesssss girl/guys who ever this hair is real the feel is soft it even came in the remy saga pack havent put my hair in but i have brought this same hair in the store and its great and last extra long it hold curl and all. will give u the update once put in but this is a must buy if u need a bang for ur buck and good quality hair not that stuff that say its real but be done after one wash not to mention im a hairdresser so yessss love it Saga Remy Yaky Gold is the best hair, and my order came quickly, and is perfect. I’ll definitely be ordering more hair from this supplier and have shared with a few friends too. My life is so much better after buying this product.  Does not tangle of knot, there is no need for a brush or comb.  The product came in good timing as well.  Such hreat quality of hair, I am so pleased at the price amazon offered it for.  I would reccomened anyone buy this hair from amazon, no better deal. Have had better hair , but worth the price. And also can tolerate a lot of heat. Would recommend to others Received the product very fast from supplier however, the hair does shed quite a bit and also noticed that there was not as much hair in bag as when i purchased from local beauty supply.  Would need 3 bags for full weave. My order was fast and loved the product.  I will definitely purchase from this place again. I love this hair. I usually don't wear straight but I am going to continue to buy this hair and style it myself. Received the hair sooner than I was told. I love every bit of it :)",2,5,-3

The high drying power works great !! This Revlon hair dryer is a good product.  It feels comfortable in my hand.  The price was good, at the time I purchased it.  I compared it to what I found at a couple of other stores and the Amazon price beat the other prices.  I liked that it has three heat settings. That and the price is why I bought it.  However, the reason I gave it four stars...... the warm setting is still too hot for me.  I have very fine and thin hair.  I cannot tell a difference in the hot and the warm setting.  I did keep it.  I am not interested in buying and testing multiple hair dryers, so I decided to keep this one. I bought this because I have waist length hair and this is a very long dryer and I wanted the back end of the dryer to be as far away from my hair as possible so it doesn't suck my hair in. I also wanted a very lightweight dryer that is large and powerful. This dryer is large and powerful and lightweight but it's not as warm as I would like it to be. It takes a long time to dry my hair with this dryer but for the other reasons I'm glad I got it. I was very picky about the buttons on the front I didn't want buttons I wanted a slider and I also wanted a cool shot that was easy to use. However it doesn't get a whole lot cooler because well it doesn't get very very hot to start with even on his highest heat setting. But for what it is it meets all my criteria and I am enjoying the dryer it has yet to suck in my hair thank goodness. Nobody paid me for this review and I received nothing for writing this review. Go forth and have a beautiful hair day. I bought this back in March of 2014, currently December of 2022. It still works GREAT. For the price, I would say this is definitely worth it. It is used almost daily. I love the heat options it has, allowing for warm or hotter air. Cold air is also an option. Also different levels of blowing strength. I use it for personal use and it is totally awesome! I bought this to replace my old model. I needed a blow dryer with 3 speeds. I loved the heat my old dryer had. With the new one the heat seems to depend on the speed. High speed equals high heat. I mainly use mine on low which gives me low heat. Takes longer to dry my hair.",2,4,-2

I never bothered to read the ingredients because it was called, ""Henna Cream.""  So, I just presumed that it was mostly henna with some botanicals.I kept the box to reorder.  But when I read the ingredients today, the second ingredient is a form of ether!  AND...there are a lot of other chemicals.  I did notice that my hair was falling out more, too.It was easy to apply but due to the chemicals I may have to go back to ""Light Mountain Cover the Grey"" all natural henna.Update:  Aug. 7, 2012I was researching again....reconsidering this product.  I looked up the ingredient, ""Dipropropylene glycol methyl ether""  and it was listed under use for cosmetics.  It is reported by FDA to be safe, but FDA deems many things safe that really are not.  So.....I guess this is the least toxic of the non-all-natural product.  It IS a compromise between the straight henna powders and the regular semi-permanent dyes.Update: Sept.18, 2012I had to color my hair quick and easy for a business trip.  I had no time or energy for anything more.  This product touted to cover ANY condition of hair...dyed, henna'd, etc.  I used the black in hopes of covering the red that resulted from using Light Mountain Cover the Grey (Dk. Brown).  Barely made a difference.  It toned it down just a bit, but still red!  So, I learned from this, that Suryea does NOT cover henna-dyed hair!!  Very disappointing!!  I will keep using this until my hair grows out, because it DOES tone down the red somewhat and helps my roots not look quite so obvious.AND...I really did like the color when I used it prior to using the LM cover the grey.  I guess this is the best compromise for me for now, as the LM CTG was way too messy and made my hair red.  So, I do recommend it, but be cautioned that it may not cover henna colored hair. I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair as mine.  My hair has always been sensitive to hair coloring.  After few treatments my hair would start thinning and have a brittleness to it.  As I've gotten older my hair has been even mor sensitive and i had continued to see thinning.  I have tried other semi-color treatments and even semi-color treatment were too strong for my hair.  I finally discovered the Henna color by Surya at my health food and vitamin store and thought I'd try it.  It's been wonderful for my hair!  Not only is it a natural dye but it is a conditioner as well.  I can always depend on my hair having good volume after each treatment due to the conditioning affect.  I use the black cream and as a full disclosure one should not expect your hair to be a true black from this product.  For my hair it comes out to a beautiful rich brown color which I really like (not a fan of black, black hair anway).  I also get an added bonus because the greys in my hair actually turn a reddish color which makes my hair appear as though I have highlights.  I have gotten so many compliments on the color of my hair, i.e. ""your highlights are beautiful"".  Some days I explain that it really isn't highlights but the Henna color that I use that has the affect and some days I just say ""why thank you!"" and don't bother to explain.  In a nutshell this product is great and I do no see the breakage that I had before as it is very gentle and the coverage is very good; comparable to any semi-color that I have ever used. I've used this product in the past on my nearly all white hair and it worked fabulously. The black color used to make my white hair a dark brown that faded naturally without harsh dye lines. It is so nourishing to the hair, that I could use it every two weeks to keep the color consistent and roots colored.BUT something changed. This last batch did not take on my roots... AT ALL. I've come to realize that since it's a stain and not opening the shaft, the following considerations will affect how your hair takes this hair color...1) It could be hard water in my shower. If that is the case, you'd need to use a hair clarifying rinse first. I used a slightly more acidic shampoo and vigorously scrubbed my hair and a second application took *slightly* more, but still a pittance compared to how it used to color.2) Medication's effects on your hair. Since using this, I've started some new medications. Those could be creating a chemical barrier on my hair.3) A bad batch?Finding easy to use, natural hair color that doesn't fry your scalp is HARD. This product is worth trying to find a way to make it work for you, but realize these things could impair the outcome. I used this product for three years.  I chose to use it because I wanted a natural alternative to traditional hair dyes while I was pregnant and nursing.  This henna does a great job of coloring grays and leaves your hair feeling soft and looking very healthy.  The only drawback is that sometimes there are small ""chunks"" of dye in certain batches.  They are like small crystals that clog the dispenser as you are applying the color, and if they do come through, they are difficult to rinse out of your hair when you are finished.  But that only seems to happen once in a while.  Otherwise I would say it is a great product for anyone who wants to stay clear of the chemicals and odors of traditional dyes, or anyone that has allergies or other sensitivities to those products. This is my first time dying my hair and I did not like the product much because my hair got red stead of black I probably did something wrong or my hair could not hold the dye as was supposed to. I have lots of gray it cover the grays just fine, but I did no see a single hair colored in black. Don't get me wrong this is a good product I have a very sensible skin and my experience with this product was very positive regarding to a chemical reactions. I'm going give another try and see the results maybe it will be black within the second try. I gave this product five stars just because of color results, otherwise I recommend this product.",5,2,3

It does a great job lifting my hair to a beautiful light blonde color (I get the champagne kit). My hair is naturally very curly (3A/3B), thick, and long. If I use the cap and hook, it’s easier if I quickly straighten my hair (it doesn’t need to be perfect) beforehand. Unfortunately, the plastic hook breaks on me every time and it’s my favorite to use. I wish they had a big metal hook. I need to poke several more times to get enough hair with the smaller metal hook. To do the back of my hair, I feel with my fingers and estimate where strands should be. Then, I poke and pull and brush it out. I will hold a mirror to see the back, and if there are any empty spots I add a few more strands. It may not be perfect but it works for my hair. Curly hair hides imperfections thankfully. It may be more obvious for straight hair. I only use half of the kit at a time and save the other half for a future highlighting session. It takes me several hours to do this, but it beats paying $100 at the salon! Take the cap off after you wash the bleach off. It’s much easier! :) The last few times I have done my hair I used level 8 golden blonde. I included the before picture showing my new growth. This highlighting kit blended it in very well. I will buy it again. I prefer warmer tones in my hair with my skin tone but if you wanted more neutral or Ash you could get more toner or purple shampoo. I have tried product and I look amazing.I did it without pull cap and it 2as easy to do my long hair all around highlights.Amazing look. As a retired stylist I do my own hilights. I use foils normally but thought I’d give this kit a try. I did add Olaplex to the mix and used 30 volume developer. The hilights turned out beautiful.Pro tip: If you have long or thick hair apply a very small amount of a silicone anti frizz serum. Make sure you brush hair well. And make sure once you’ve pull the hair through comb it over the cap to catch all the hair so you don’t end up with uneven pieces. Also, check it at first in 10 mins. Than every 5 mins. Use a clarifying shampoo the day before and for God’s sake don’t leave it on an hour! I will say I highlighted myself the lazy way and it looked striking and horrible haha- way too clumpy. I didn't follow the rules and could not figure out how to use the cap that came with it. So I went and got an ash blonde color tone wash to do as a second step and now my hair looks fine and the highlights look less drastic Muy fácil usar Only used half, will use again for highlights. Color came out nice , recommend, arrived well. Great do it yourself product with rewarding results. I watched lots of videos and read all the reviews I could for tips for success. The cap was not very easy to use, yet the results were worth the effort as I have not highlighted my hair at home before. So I had to use 2 mirrors to see the back and side hole metal hook placement and it was a bit of a stretch to do but good investment of time. Took a couple of hours to complete pulling long hair through every hole. I even stopped and took a break for a bit. Watching how-to videos on YouTube really made a difference in my success. I even watched professionals explain how to start at the front top pulling strands through the cap. Then complete the sides starting from the front to back. Reading the directions and videos helped remind me to start putting lightener on back of head first and away from the roots. Then going back and doing the roots thoroughly. This is because the heat from your head will accelerate the processing and you get more lift at the roots than the ends if you apply the bleach on all parts at the same time. I did order a tool hair bleaching kit that has the thin brush/comb. I recommend using that to make sure every piece of hair you want highlighted is saturated. The formula has great thickness to it and with my long hair I used the entire mixture. I have undyed light brown hair and left the mixture on for an hour for the desired results. It was somewhat unnerving waiting and watching my hair turn orange-ish, then yellow, then perfectly blonde. Hang in there. Don't stop processing too early. That's what worked for me anyway.The leave in toner is terrific butsuper drippy. It had zero thickness-very watery. So I listened to the reviewer that advised applying toner in the shower. Great tip! So happy with the outcome. Did end up with a couple of very minor ""hot root"" spots right in front so got some Mineral Infusion Gray Root Concealer medium brown color to 'fix' the oopsy spots-works great! Research ""hair mascara"" if you want to know more about those type of products. Although it's for covering grey, I like the little presicion wand to fix trouble spots of my highlights. It just looked more appealing to have instead of the spray root touch up. Actually, I'm not sure what they're called but hair is light then dark then light again. So kind of a calico oops.The highlights look beautiful and natural. A lovely pick me up. And, a couple of 'hot roots'/calico places that I will keep covering after each time I wash my hair will serve as a reminder how brave I was, as a newbie, to have highlighted my own hair because of the pandemic.",5,4,1

I typically used a nourishing oil, put a shower cap on and then put on this heating cap. Heat opens up the hair follicles and enables the oil to penetrate and fortify the hair. My hair has not only grown but is has gotten thicker from incorporating this product into my hair care treatment process. If you are concerned with your hair care and health BUY THIS PRODUCT!! The hood is too small to fit an adult head. Very misleading when purchasing! I've had this heat cap for a while now and I've been trying to give it the benefit of the doubt but the simple truth is that this thing doesn't get hot at all. Even on the highest heat it's Luke warm; my car gets hotter than it. Save your money just get a microwavable heat cap. If you're interested in locking in moisture with your natural hair, this is the product that you need in your washing regimen! I have 4A texture low porosity hair. I am in love with my natural hair, all the moreso after using this product. My hair is manageable, retaining more moisture and is thriving because of this conditioning cap. The heat allows my low porosity hair to absorb the products more deeply. The heat is evenly displaced...for the most part...definitely feels more concentrated at the crown. I sit with the cap on for about 15 minutes...takes maybe 20 seconds to heatup...The cord is very long...roughly 3ft. The highest setting is definitely hot...I use medium setting...You must use a plastic cap with this conditioning cap. I just love this product, I highly recommend it for all coarse textured chicks IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE! It’s super small, so if you have an adult size head it’s a tight fit, LOL. It’s good looking, it doesn’t get very hot to be honest with you, and I’ve just been too lazy to return it. I would not purchase it a second time. And it’s disappointing, because I do like this brand. Thickness is adequate but it could have been a tad larger It did seem weak as many other reviews stated but it did the job well. I used it to apply henna to my hair and it can be a challenge to get the color tto stick to grey but using this cap gave me better results than I have ever had. If the heat was more evenly distributed through the cap I would have given 5 stars.",1,5,-4

The price was unbeatable and the quality of this product is amazing. Its just what I wanted. Very good Have had an issue recently finding a good quality shampoo and conditioner and this combo has worked great for my dry hair! My hair got really greasy really fast, so really rinse it out good, then it’ll be good for your hair. I love it, once I figured out how to use it. I’ve been using the super skinny hair serum gloss drops for over 15 years (bought a new bottle in addition to these!) which works fantastic for me since my hair is curly, thick and can be unruly - I flat iron my hair with the serum so decided to try out these shampoo and conditioner thinking they’d pair well with the serum, and boy was I right! My hair feels soft, smooth and silky! They have helped the blow drying process and lessen the need to flat iron as intensely as before. My only drawbacks are that I have sensitive skin and the fragrance can definitely irritate my skin, but that’s a risk I take to get the desired effects of styling to my liking. Great value for the price to go for the bigger bottles and only require a small amount each shower. Def recommend!! The shampoo itself is wonderful. I've used this treatment by Paul Mitchell before and it has done wonders for my very thick and unruly hair. I give a rating of two stars due to the condition of the package I received. In truth, It bewilders me on how this package even made it to my front door. To say it in my most eloquent way, it was beat to all hell! All four corners of the box were smashed and the box itself was covered in what looked like soot.I pick it up to find that I can feel the bottles of shampoo rolling around. I open it up to see that there are four measly pieces of newspaper for packaging and that's it. The bottles of shampoo unsurprisingly resembled the box that it came in. How they did not explode while shipping is a miracle. I chose to order from Barlett Discount Beauty. I was charged over 13 dollars for shipping and it arrived in terrible condition. A forewarning to all those considering this seller. LOVE this shampoo and conditioner set! Not only does it smooth out frizz and make my hair super soft but it also does NOT weigh it down! I've usually found that a product that smooths out my hair also tends to make It pretty oily but not this! I don't wash my hair every day(usually every 2-3..: 4 if its a super lazy week!) and even after 3 days of not shampooing my hair is still soft and manageable and not greasy. After using the super skinny shampoo and conditioner I also use the super skinny serum- which is the best smelling hair product ever! The combo is just right. I'm so happy to have found a line of products that works well with my hair (long, dark brown, layered, thick and mainly straight with a slight wave when it wants). All in all the super skinny line by Paul Mitchell is fantastic and for a great discount from salon prices, you can't go wrong with this purchase! I am obsessed with the Paul Mitchell super skinny shampoo and conditioner. I use PM's other super skinny products and am always so happy with them. First of all, this shampoo and conditioner combo is great for dyed hair! I color my hair and this stuff really helps your hair maintain health and moisture while maintaining your color. It also really helps the blow drying and styling process go a lot quicker. This product cuts static out of hair and keeps my hair from getting greasy for a number of days.

I ""discovered"" this product in college and have been a user ever since (yes, I am old - Gen Xer here). Over the years I have tried other (meaning cheaper) products, but always come back to this one. I had a difficult time finding this during the pandemic, which really did a number on my texture and curl level, but now that it is back in stock my hair is once again loving me back. It looks healthy again, curls beautifully and has stopped shedding. For anyone with curly hair who has never tried this, take a chance. I use it daily as a leave-in conditioner. I damped my hair, use two pumps of this with a squeeze of the Biolage gelee, scrunch it through my hair and let it air dry. Just beautiful!!!  Now if I could just find something non-toxic to tackle the newly present gray.... Having used Humectress since the '80s, here's how I apply it: First, I use a cheap conditioner in the shower just to get out the tangles. Then after toweling my hair off a little, I put a glob of Humectress in the palm of my hand, work it through my hair and LEAVE IT IN. Then, comb and blow dry. Works great for me. For extra shine, I'll add a little hair oil to the glob and mix them together. Hope this helps someone out there! I love this conditioner for my hair. I switched to it when my hair kept falling out. Unfortunately the pump tends to stop working even when it’s still full. But still a good conditioner and lasts forever Thought it would be a better product..doesnt soften as good as cheaper brands I have bought Good sale great brand The product was as described and delivered as promised. Amazon makes everything easy. Love the product but pump broke in package Use it on dry, damaged, colored hair! Cut off the dead hair though!",1,2,-1

Conditioner, 8.5 oz. Calms Frizz, Detangles, Wash & Go, Co Wash, Sulfate Free, Paraben Free, Color Safe (Pack of 1)","So this is my honest LONGGGG review. I bought this product with my own money. I hope that this review will aid someone in making a decision about whether this product maybe right for them. I purchased this product from ""HappyUSA"" (fulfilled by Amazon, I have prime so it came in about a weeks time after purchasing) around early December 2016 so I have been using it for about a month now.My hair type: My hair texture is very kinky, coarse with really tight curls/ coils like a slinky, with the back being slightly looser. I guess my hair type is a 4C. I have rather thin strands of hair, each is very thin and easily breakable. I also have medium hair density. My hair is not fine because my scalp is not to clearly seen and it is not full because my scalp is easy to find. With this combination my hair is prone to breakage. However my largest issue like all naturals is retaining moisture. My hair is naturally super dry, almost like a desert. I feel that my scalp produces no sebum at all( or so little it is not reaching down any of my strands). In addition, my hair is considered low porosity so it is hard to get the moisture in my hair and products can easily cake up on my scalp.My reason for buying the product: Like many who buy this product my goal was extra moisture. I needed a form of deep conditioning since my hair loves it, but the ones I found on the market so far did not aid me. I used to use ""Natural Girls Rock"" deep conditioner, which had a lot if slip and mainly oil based but then it stopped agreeing with my hair. They maybe changed the formula or added more frangrance because it started to make my scalp itch and just sat on top of my hair. Plus all the ""Shea Moisture"" masque I tried just left my hair feeling dry with film on top of it. I could not find just a decent deep conditioner to leave my hair soft so I decided to give ""Giovanni"" a try.The packaging: The product container is in some type of parallelogram shape; it is wide at the base or bottom and then tappers or thins at the top. It is a thin container so I can see why some may complain they feel like they are not getting enough. The product is tall or average height but then thin so it tricks the mind into believing there is more product then there actually is, so hence the price. It is a slightly opaque white color, so you can see just enough in order to know how much you have left. They fill the container to the top with conditioner. The top is a flip open and close. One also squeezes to get the product out, almost like a plastic ketchup bottle. It is 8.5fl. Oz or 250ml. In the back ""Giovanni"" has a scale whether it is light or deep conditioner and according to them this is a deep conditioner. To my knowledge the product is not a fake or counterfeit but seems like the real product, especially when you compare the packaging to the official ones on the ""Giovanni"" website.Ingredients: aqua (purified water), cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetrimonium bromide, glycerin, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural fragrance, hydrolyzed soy protein, *chamomilla recutita (matricara) leaf extract, * citrus aurantium dulcis ( Valencia orange) extract, *cymbopogon schoenanthus (grapefruit) extract, *echinacea purpurea extract, *ginkgo biloba extract, *glycine soja (soybean) seed extract, *lavandula angustifola (lavender) extract, *rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) leaf extract, *macrocystis pyrifera ( sea kelp) extract, *mangifera indica (mango) extract, *salix alba (willow bark) extractThe product performance 4/5: There is a lot of hype around the ""Giovanni"" brand, especially the smooth as silk line. I heard that many had success with it and my friends told me to give it a try since I wanted a deep conditioner. I just needed extra moisture because my hair is very dry. When my hair does get moisturized effectively it can hold moisture for about 3 days without me adding extra product. This product did provide me with extra moisture. First I tried this on dry hair and let it sit for about 3 hours, just to be safe under a plastic cape ( I know their is debate about how long to leave a deep conditioner but this one doesn't have a time frame. Some say to leave it for 20-30min, others say 1hour, some overnight but 3hours works best for me). It left my hair soft, but not overly moisturized, so not super soft like my hair took in a lot of moisture and thus was disappointing. Then I tried it between washes. I wet my hair, and mixed the Giovanni with jojoba, vegetable glycerin and coconut oil (not to much). Again my hair was left soft but not as hydrated, however a little better then the first time. Finally, I tried it on freshly washed hair. I applied it through sections and like all the other times left it for 1-3hours. After rinsing the results were the same. My hair felt smooth but not as hydrated as it would be with vegetable glycerin mixed with water. This product may work best with a steamer or under a hooded dryer like most moisturizers do. But I rank this product so well because it made it really easy to detangle my hair. I finger detangle so this product worked really well with this method. It gently coats the hair, so the hair feels smooth but not heavy or like something is on it. The beauty about this product is that it is so light weight so no caking.So after using this for a month I found that:Pros- It is not expensive-like the squeezable packaging-product has enough slip and not crazy thick so great texture- on a moisture scale of 1-5 it moisturizes at a 4/5 with my hair. Thus, it does what it claims so I guess it works.-Works well as a base with oils and etc. ( in my experience it worked the best with these, I.e jojoba, coconut and vegetable glycerin water mix).- the best is that it allows for great detangling!-light weight won't leave crazy build up- a small amount goes a long way.-it claims to be USDA certified organic, no animal testing or parabens, sulfates (for those that are concerned about this)Cons- It claims to be organic but the ingredient list can be a con to some (not to me),especially since alcohols are the first five ingredients. However, remember not all alcohols are bad for hair just do research if you are curious or concerned.- Fragrance, which is a very strong irritant and really should not be put in anything, it is high on the ingredient list. So if you have sensitive skin like me, or a sensitive scalp or prone to eczema break outs this can cause this product to irritate the scalp. Some have complained about this and for me it was true. The product doesn't have a strong smell but try to keep it far from your scalp (conditioner is not meant on the scalp anyways).- Does not tell you when it should be washed off so not so great directions-not much product sadlyOverall I do recommend this product. It does moisturize, not the best for me but great for right now, it is low cost and comes in a decent size especially if you have medium to fine hair density. It is light weight, good slip, great base for other ingredients. Even though I loath the fact that it contains irritating fragrance, it is a good product. A little goes a long way. Make sure you pay close attention to the ends when applying and I will be repurchasing this product again when I run out. Hope this review helped someone. Nothing special, not the best conditioner I've ever used, but also not the worst. I have long curly/wavy hair. I feel like good conditioner is really thick, this stuff is a bit thinner/watery-er than I'd like. But it didn't make the color come out of my hair faster or make my curls weird or anything like that. It's just fine. The first time I tried this, I wasn't terribly impressed.  I didn't notice a huge difference in moisture, the smell isn't terribly exciting, and it just seemed kind of mediocre.  And then one day, I had colored my hair, put gel AND mousse into it and it was a huge mess.  I couldn't even run my fingers through it when I shampooed it!  I smoothed 1 tsp (yes I measured) of this conditioner onto the length of my hair and with one pass using prayer hands, I could automatically run my hands through it again!  Just one smoothing pass over my hair!  I was shocked!  I will definitely buy this again! Upon first receiving the product I noticed that the actual bottle is quite slim though the same height as other conditioner bottles on the market. The problem is that I would probably get at best 3 washes out of this conditioner since I have coarse, very coily somewhat thick hair. If you must hair type it, class 4 for african american hair. It seems to work better on hair that has an actual shampoo, if you do the no poo method or even cowash you may not feel the replenishing benefits this offers and it may not feel heavy enough for those used to that feel. It smells very nice, herbal like and has a very nice smooth feel, it really does make your hair *depending on your shampoo* feel like liquid silk, very smooth. It was very easy to detangle my hair even before I sat under the dryer for 15 minutes, afterward my hair felt heavy with moisture and its lovely light scent. Washing it out never left my hair feeling like it needed more. If it was readily available in Japan on base i'd buy it way more. I just can't see myself buying this small bottle once a month and waiting 2 weeks for it since I currently wash my hair weekly. There is a larger size available from someone on amazon but I can't spend that large amount on conditioner, so its my loss. It is very good though and its ph is about 7 if i'm not mistaken. Try it once you'll love it! I loved this conditioner. It made my hair silky and healthy. The natural ingredients help a lot to not aggravate my asthma.  However, I purchased a new bottle in Dec. 2014.  The ingredients seem to have changed.  There are new alcohols listed in the ingredients, and they are the first ingredients listed.  After a few uses I noticed my hair seemed much drier and frizzier.  I compared a bit of the old on one side and new on the other.  There was a definite difference.  I'm very disappointed that they would change a formulation of such a popular product.I found this on another website. It seems to match what each of my bottles have listed: Here are the new ingredientsAqua (water), cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, butylene glycol, cetrimonium bromide, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural fragrance, hydrolyzed soy protein, *chamomilla recutita (matricaria) leaf extract, *citrus aurantium dulcis (valencia orange) extract, *citrus grandis (grapefruit) fruit extract, *cymbopogon schoenanthus (lemongrass) extract, *echinacea purpurea extract, *ginkgo biloba extract, *glycine soja (soybean) seed extract, *lavandula angustifolia (lavender) extract, *rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, *macrocystis pyrifera (sea kelp) extract, *mangifera indica (mango) extract, *salix alba (willow bark) extract.",1,2,-1

I like the shampoo and a little bit goes along way left my hair feeling clean and hydrated and shine actually no tangles that was before I even used the conditioner.The smell is pleasant not overpowering at all not sweet smelling imo. It does come with a pump which is awesomely handy in the shower. My hair is natural so I'm still looking for that product that works best on my hair not sure I would buy agree because it is expensive that is the negative for me and why 4 stars. Also I did receive a sample of (Vinegar Nutritive Rinse Cleanser) have not used and really don't like to use vinegar in relation to my hair...my hair says nooooooo🤦 The only thing that I can remember is that the shampoo smells pretty good. Other than that, it dries up my hair pretty quickly. I'm not saying that it's bad, I'm just saying that if possible, maybe the seller or the website of this product can get you a sample. It may work for your hair so give it a shot. Finally I have found a shampoo that will not dry out my 4c course hair. This shampoo is amazing and left my hair completely clean and extremely moisturized. I naturally have very dry hair and for years I have been searching for a shampoo that will not only clean but also moisturize my hair. A lot of them either did one or the other but never both..well not for my hair at least. I came across this shampoo while researching products for natural hair on Bing and decided to try it out. This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used. My hair was left so so soft like whipped butter and it took me a little by surprise too because I can't remember at all when I could be able to put my fingers through my hair after washing it with so much ease!!! A little goes a long way with this shampoo, I didn't even have to use that much, just a quarter sized amount produced more than enough lather. It does not have a strong scent, I would say its a subtle nice scent and not overpowering at all. Leaves the hair feeling clean and soft. It may be a little spendy but believe me this is quality stuff and I would rather pay more for something good than less for something that won't work at all. I am definately going to purchase a second bottle...this stuff is amazing!!!!!!!!!! It doesn't makes my hair soft at all. I needed more from the bottle to wash my hair, that's mean it won't last me. My hair still feel hard after conditioning it didn't work for me. I've been struggling with finding the right product for my natural hair.  So I bought this shampoo, along with the conditioner and leave in conditioner.  It was VERY pricey, but I was getting desperate.  I normally use the conditioner more for refreshing my hair after working out, and shampoo once a month.  Today, I finally used the shampoo today and I am FLOORED.  It is so rich and thick ... but it easily coats the hair which makes detangling a cinch!  The first ingredient is Aloe Vera, and that's exactly what the shampoo looks like.  It gets very sudsy, so use sparingly.  Once you lather, you will smell the mint.  I finger detangled my hair while letting the shampoo sit in my hair, and I did it in MINUTES. I am in love.  I HIGHLY recommend this product! I wanted to like this product, but unfortunately it left my scalp irritated.  The ingredients say there is rosemary in it.  Rosemary is known to cause scalp irritation on sensitive scalps.  I washed my hair a week ago and my scalp is burning like crazy now.  I think I may be allergic to it and can no longer use it. Although this stuff is a little pricey, I must say it is SO worth it!If you have natural hair and are concerned with moisturizing your hair starting with the wash, then this is for you. I have 4a/ab natural hair and this shampoo does a wonderful job cleaning and moisturizing and does not irritate my scalp with extra chemicals.Lets be real, I gave up the relaxer because of harmful chemicals, so why accept them in any other hair care products I use????Honestly, I tried to avoid spending the money on this shampoo by purchasing some other ""natural"" shampoo and REALLY regretted it! The other stuff felt good on my hair while it was still wet, but as soon as it dried...CRUNCH!JustNatural has spoiled my hair :-) I feel like I need another shampoo on top of this to make me feel like my hair is really clean.....its just ""ok"".",1,3,-2

I have never had any issues with product.  I actually have 2.  One for everyday use and 1 for travel. A mi esposa le encanto, dice que le ayuda con su cabello, es mas rápida y ligera que otra que ha probado. Le gusta la comodidad del peine y como le queda su cabello Works very well. I've also loaned it to others with very thick curly hair while traveling, and it worked well for them also. Unless you have extremely curly hair, it works just as well as a Chi. Save your money and get this instead.Some things I like about the product are: (1) the adjustable temperature dial is nice for those with fine hair as a mid-range temperature works fine for my hair and it allows me to minimize the heat damage. (2) the cord is extra long, longer than any of my other hair appliances, and is great if you are in a space where the outlet is far from a mirror, or at the gym and trying to stay out of people's way while sharing a mirror. (3) The plate is really wide. I feel like it gets the hair really smooth even with just a quick pass. I have really long hair and find it very helpful as I don't want to create any more damage by having to move the iron over the hair really slowly, or having to make two passes over the hair section.The thing that is a little odd (but not bad when you get used to it) is the comb-like attachment on one side. As you slide the flat iron down the hair shaft, if this clip is facing up instead of down, it will pull on your hair terribly and get tangled. I made this mistake several times when I first bought this product and wasn't yet used to it. Now that I have used a few weeks, it doesn't bother me (and I don't make that mistake any more). I'm not sure it really serves a purpose. I assume it is intended to separate the hair, and maybe that is helpful for people with curly hair? My hair has a slight wave to it, and it doesn't seem to do anything for me.**Update**I've had this product for over a year now and still use it regularly. It has held up well, and still works like new.I spend time trying to write helpful and thorough reviews of products that I really like, really dislike, or like with some qualifications that might bother some people in using the product. Please let me know how I am doing by selecting ""yes"" below if you found this review helpful. If you did not find it helpful, please let me know how I can improve my reviews by leaving a comment below. Thank you! This is a decent straightener. I was using the Conair 2"" Ceramic Straightener before (which I loved) but it broke after 4 years of use. They no longer make that model anymore so I was looking for a similar straightener with a detachable comb.This one pretty much gets the job done. Here's a summary of my experience with it. For the record, I have medium thick hair about shoulder length and a LOT of it.HEAT: It heats up fast...about 1-2 minutes. The heat, however, doesn't seem to stay constant. Sometimes while using it, I notice that it might get a little cooler only to heat up again. Still, it's not a large drop in temperature and the only thing I have to do is go over that portion of hair again. It doesn't get as hot as my Conair one did so I typically have to set it to one of the highest settings.GLIDE: The porcelain ceramic is excellent. It's VERY smooth. It never catches my hair. No complaints here.COMB: The comb is good. Sometimes it pulls my hair out but that's probably because it's already slightly tangled. All combs do pull some hair out, I guess. At first glance, the comb seemed to small to make a difference in my thick hair but after trying it, it combed through perfectly.TEXTURE: My hair feels kind of rough before hand but the straightener definitely makes it smoother. But it's not as smooth as I would like it to be. This damages my hair a lot more easily than other straighteners. Also, when I run it through certain sections of my hair (i.e. bangs), it leaves them looking frizzy.BOTTOM LINE: It's decent for the price you pay. My experience with it definitely hasn't been as AMAZING as other people's have been. But I'm still using it and will probably continue to do so until it breaks. After that, however, I think I'll look for another straightener instead of purchasing this one again. I love this flat iron!!  I have used flat irons for probably 15 years or more.  I swore by Solano Sapphire for a long time as the one I had was equipped with a removable comb.  It was finally time to get another and those were no longer available so I went with a babyliss (different one) which I really liked but oh no..if fell in some water and was ruined.  When I went to replace it that one was no longer available either..sigh.  I then switched to another Babyliss iron with steam and a comb kind of thing in the middle?  Not quite what I wanted but I was desperate.  I then saw this sweet little thing and had to try it.  I have to say it is smallish as far as fitting in your hand, but it is smooth as can be and I love the comb.  It is much like my Solano was in that regard.  You can't beat the price as every other flat iron I have ever bought was over $100.  I even bought a second one of these as a backup and might even buy a 3rd one.  :)  I don't want to end up like before where the ones I like are no longer made.  I hope they make this one forever or at least one similar with a comb.  The comb makes such a huge difference when straightening your hair...it keeps your hair in the flat iron versus slipping out.  Try it you will like it!",5,5,0

Ultra-Thin Straightening Iron,"This specific brand was recommended by my hair stylist. Heats up super fast. Works very well. I love that it’s thinner than other flat irons making it easier to get closer to the roots. Packaged well when delivered. A little bulky for travel and I wish it came with a heat resistant bag like my last one did. I ended upbuying a mini of the same brand for travel. We’ve owned several straighteners and this by far exceeds them all! Excellent product Funciona bien Not crazy about all these thousands of influencers making claims about millions of products, but this one hairstylist I saw on YouTube used this BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium flat iron on her client with hair like mine (thick 4c) and I was immediately impressed.  I've purchased my own and am SO happy I did.  Although most flat irons are not that expensive, using the wrong one over the years really has messed up my hair game and not given smooth results.  I use my BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium flat iron with my Silky Straight hair spray with argan oil heat protectant and my hair literally says I love you when I'm done. I really love this company and my flat irons Used this in high school and dropped it and it broke in half , finally had enough $ to get another one and am obsessed It is a nano so doing my hair in smaller section’s definitely helped get the results I wanted. Also it only took me like 2-3 passes before it was bone straight and I don’t feel like it damaged my hair at all. There was a little smoke but I think that was from the heat protector spray I applied. All in all great product.",3,5,-2

I wish there was a little grip or a more frosted option like the blonde colored ones.This new style includes no slip tiny teeth on the inside of the claw that help it stay in place. Helpful because they truly work. Kind of not helpful because they can get stuck. I bought the medium clips thinking they would actually be a medium size,  they're extra large,  too much for my hair. The product for the price Doesn't quite fit my thick hair the way I'd like. MEASUREMENTS: 3 1/2 inches LONG x 2 1/4 inches WIDELOL, I thought I was simply ordering another set of my normal, albeit much smaller hair clips. Right now I'm staring at 3 ginormous clips that look virtually prehistoric. I would have had to inherit genes for hair 3 or more times what my parents did manage to pass along. Instead, I hope I know someone who could actually use these clips. Oh well, Merry Christmas to that someone. These are great! There is actually 3 cards of 3 clips. These are the good ones that have a little ""give"" so they don't break instantly like the last ones I got from another seller. I will definitely buy these again. I get the big no slip clips by Scunci for long hair.  I thought I was ordering those but these are not those.  They are smaller but grip fine.  I have a lot of hair so they are a tight fit.  But they don't stick out as far as the others.  That's actually better because when driving or sitting the others put my neck at a weird angle which these don't do.  These are made sturdier too.  Mistakingly bought but am glad I did!  I like them! I’ve been using this set for years. I love them. If I drop them on our tile floor they will break a claw off sometimes, but one set will last me a long time!",1,4,-3

That's stupid.  It's worth the full price, and sometimes Amazon drops the price to $1 a bottle, which is a bargain.  The last time I noticed that, I bought three bottles.I squirt a little in the tub as I'm running my bath and it makes nice bubbles while scenting the air.  Then I get in and wash my face, hair, and body with it, fast and easy, and jump out ready for the day.  It works nicely on my face - shampoo is a good choice for washing your face as long as the pH is neutral to slightly acid, because it's not a soap and will not clog your pores.  If your skin is sensitive, YMMV, but I've enjoyed using this on my face.  It's nice not to have to deal with face cleanser, body cleanser, and shampoo - one and done. Used to buy this at my local convenience store and decided to one day see if Amazon sold it. Of course Amazon sells this, what don't they sell? haha! Anyways, this stuff gets the job of shampooing done and it smells great. Only need to use a small amount because it really foams up good. Not much else to say about shampoo.Reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5? I CANNOT STAND THE CAP ON THIS BOTTLE! The cap takes a fair amount of effort to pop open and then it doesn't ever seem to seal all the way. Always some soap residue on the bottle from it leaking a little bit.Pros:-Favorite shampoo-Smells great-Good price-Gets the job done-Foams up goodCons:-Beware the cap Great; love this. This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean. It leaves my hair looking clean and healthy. The bottle is the perfect shape and size that is easy to hold on to and the cap is easy to open when your hands are wet.The scent is nice, but I think it should be stronger. I would give it 5 stars if the scent was stronger.Overall, a great product are the price you pay. Perfect shampoo for the price and an almost bald man. I don't want to spend a lot for shampoo, but I don't want a shampoo that is going to cause dandruff. Suave has always been the best for me If you want a decent product for a fair price, this is it. Although this is not Paul Mitchell level by any means, if you are on a low budget then this is certainly one for you that will not hurt your hair and it smells very good as well. Enjoy! I buy this for my kids. They waste so much soap that I wanted a more economical option. The smell of the shampoo doesn't linger, but neither does the smell of stinky head. I have no complaints. makes my hair silky.honestly I know you are just buying this because its dirt cheap.  If you wait it will eventually go on sale for like a dollar a bottle.  So i'll be rocking suave for a while unless mane and tail slashes its price.  I'm a simple kinda guy if you can't tell.",5,4,1

Ice used to make a better quality. I like to cut my own hair and these scissors did the job. The only thing is that they were not as sharp towards the end, but for the price it was sufficient. Just had to cut my hair in smaller portions and it took me a little longer, but I was content with the final product. You just have to be careful not too cut too much hair at a time because since they are not that sharp at the end it will make it a little more difficult. I purchased these because I needed a pair of shears, but I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on a pair since I don't really use them a whole lot to justify the cost. I came across these shears and they work lovely for what I use them for, which is mostly for finishing touches. For a hairdresser or a hair stylist, however, you may want to invest in a better pair since your use of shears are far more frequent than that of a barber. These are solid, but I can only vouch for the standards in which I use them, unfortunately. I  needed some sharp sissors and the one around the house were no sharp enough.  These work just fine I have a pair of these scissors I bought a few years ago locally.  I liked them so much, I ordered 2 more from Amazon.  They have the same brand and description and they look like my original scissors in the picture; however, the ones I received are a knock-off of the real brand.  Mine are made in Germany and I overlooked reading in the description that these were made in China.  The difference is night and day in cutting.  My old ones are still sharp and accurate, these are very poor quality and out of the box do not cut well at all.  I don't remember what I paid for my original scissors but the price of these 2 seemed a bargain - I should have figured out such nice scissors wouldn't be at the price I paid, but the product seemed to be one and the same.  Disappointed that they were a copy from China - not sure how they keep getting away with using the same brand names and descriptions of their fake products. I had two questions when I ordered these:One, does a screw hold the blades together so they can be separated for cleaning and sharpening? Yes, it is removable. And the bearing area around the screw is not highly polished so it can take oil.Two, is the thumb hole generous enough for a fat thumb? Yes and no, I'd say. It fits me, but it isn't real roomy. It's an ellipse about 2cm by 2.3cm. If you wear XL gloves, this is probably not the tool for you.One more feature I didn't see in the description or the picture is the gold coating around the finger loops and about 2cm up the stems. They look nice. These are pretty good haircutting scissors considering I spend $3 on them. They do cut well. Only drawback is I didn't look more carefully at the measurements, these scissors are for people with small hands, and mine are a little too big. After cutting for 5 minutes my hand started to hurt. Also, because they are so small, you can only cut a tiny little bit of hair at a time. If you have small hands these are great scissors for the price. Bought these because I don't want my hair chopped off when I go to get a ""trim"". Used them the other night and trimmed my own hair. Worked fine. Seems sturdy and good quality product. Obviously have to wipe them off every time to prevent any rust. I put them back in the slip and keep them in a drawer so moisture won't get to it. Not sure if they will rust but just want to prevent it.",2,4,-2

My hair had more volume and appeared thicker! I am a little shocked that it worked that fast. I bought the shampoo and spray too. Not sure if I need the spray- that tends to dry out my hair. A little goes a long way. It's a good conditioner but It's a small bottle to small for the price it's advertised Aging has caused my hair to thin a great deal. Friends recommended this product which I combine with a Fekkai glossing conditioner for perfect results.  My hair is soft and shining despite being gray and coarse. I've have very thin hair and this helps a lot.

Sadly, my curls usually flee before I even get to work.After doing research on flat irons, and reading MANY reviews, I ordered the Ceramic Tools CT2555 1"" Professional Ceramic Flat Iron and received it a week ago. I've since used it about four to five times in the process of learning how to use it. What a huge difference this flat iron has made already! Since I started using it, my hair seems thicker, smoother, more manageable and MUCH healthier.My normal routine is that I wash and condition my hair once a week and blow-dry with an Ionic hair dryer set on ""warm"". Next, I use about a nickel-size of Biosilk Silk Therapy Serum throughout my hair, comb through, and then use the Ceramic Tools CT2555 1"" Professional Ceramic Flat Iron in small sections, first straightening, then adding curls. Once done, I let the curls cool, then comb and style as desired. Before using the Ceramic Tools CT2555 1"" Professional Ceramic Flat Iron, during the drying and styling process, my hair would feel a little dry and brittle and there would be a noticeable amount of hair on the comb and on the floor by the time I'm done. I realized last night and this morning that after using this flat iron and the Biosilk for only a week, there was absolutely NO BREAKAGE, and little if any shedding! I can't remember EVER seeing this result before.I sing with my church's praise and worship team weekly, and sometimes for every service (as many as four to five times a week depending on whether there are special programs). Usually afterwards, my hairstyle is completely sweated out. Yesterday, I decided to try the curls for the first time using the Ceramic Tools CT2555 1"" Professional Ceramic Flat Iron, and was amazed that my curls lasted ALL DAY, even through intense praise, worship and sweating! After combing my hair again, it looked like I had just had it done!At the end of the day, I wrap my hair and secure it with a wig cap then tie a scarf on to keep the cap in place. The next morning all I have to do is unwrap it, comb and go. And the Biosilk Silk Therapy Serum is so light that even after three days of use...and SWEATING...there is no build up, and my hair has body and bounce.I had read that using a good ceramic flat iron with far-infra-red technology would help keep the hair straight and hold on to the curl. This flat iron proved it's worth in one week and I'm EXTREMELY satisfied. I ordered this product, and with in a week I had it delivered to my house. I didn't have to wait forever to get my package.Now to review this product:1. I have had this a little over a week. It heats up great, super fast. I have two kids so I am usually in a rush to get myself ready, so I love that it heats up so quickly.2. I have wavy/curly hair, so I have to set mine on the highest setting, even though the box gives a chart and shows that my heat setting should be 17-21, I find that the chart is wrong, because I have to have it at the highest setting which is 25.3. Its very slim/small.4. The only thing I find that I don't like about it, is that during the day I find myself looking in the mirror and straightening my hair again, because its starting to have waves in it again. Now i'm thinking that my hair needs to maybe get used to this straightener. Im not really sure. I have used is four times this past week.5. I love that it has a swivel cord on it, also the cord is very long.Overall it is worth buying. I would recommend this.I like it, I can't say OMG! Im soo in love with my straightener, but I can say I like it. I wanted a flat iron that wasn't going to break the bank, but still give me professional quality. Well, this is it! I bought this off Amazon about 2 months ago, and have used it almost everyday since it arrived.The temperature settings are great, however you may have to play with it a bit to find what one is best for you. I feel the settings they give you for hair types is a little off. I h ave thinner hair that is curly, and they say a 15 I believe is where I need to set it.. that didn't work well for me, I am now at the 20 setting and it works perfect.I saw some reviews saying they burnt themselves holding the plates together... why on earth are you holding the plates?? Your hands need not go anywhere near them while using this, if you use smaller sections of hair (about 1.5 to 2 inches wide) this iron glides right over and straightens easily and quickly. It does not get too close to your head if used properly, so in the 2 months, I have never burnt myself... or my 8 year old who straightens hers usually only 1 time a week. And yes, I do hers... but let her have a chance to try on her own supervised.Use some thermal care products of your choice (I use Suave) to keep your hair healthy from constant hat styling and this is a fantastic piece of hair equipment!I would say this was one of the best purchases I have made in a while. After my 3rd Chi flat iron broke, I was not eager to dump $70 on a new one. I searched Amazon for some lower-priced flat irons and decided on this one. I've been using it every day for a month now and I can say it's doing an extremely good job. I have very unruly, wavy hair and this iron flattens it just as well as the Chi did. I did like the Chi more, it was a bit smoother, but this one does a pretty darn good job in comparison. And you can't beat the price! At $17, I expected to have a lot to complain about. I was pleasantly surprised by it's performance, and I honestly have nothing bad to say about it.If you're looking for a decent, affordable flat iron, then buy this. It's one of the best money-saving decisions I've ever made. It's not the best out there, obviously, and I'd be surprised if it lasted more than a year, but I definitely won't buying any more Chi's. This thing does a pretty much the same job at a quarter of the price...the only difference being that it's a tad rougher on my hair. I have a bottle of heat-protective spray that I use with before straightening my hair, and I'd highly recommend getting something like this. Straightening, no matter what iron you use, is very rough on your hair. Especially if you do it often.Edit:It is now September, 2011, and this flat iron is still working perfectly. Definitely one of the best purchases of my life.",2,4,-2

450 F High Heat Ceramic Press Comb with Dual Voltage and Auto Shut-off, Gold, 1 Count","I have very long thick wavy hair and bought this to straighten certain top parts of my hair on humid days and or after getting out of the shower (when I wear straighter hairstyles.)  Overall if you are looking to achieve just that- this can work well enough (which is why I gave it four stars.) However, did not give 5 stars because it did not straighten on 1st or 2nd pass and even took several passes for best straightening effects.  Not using alot so not a comcern. I bought this hot comb after my last one broke. Never knew I needed something so much. The comb gets extremely hot, has a stand to prevent the burns to your counters, and it helps my wig installs get extremely flat. Please be careful while the combs ability to get hot is a pro, it is also a con. You can burn yourself pretty bad if you’re not careful. First let me say this hotcomb goes up to 400 degrees. It doesn’t smoke, or leave a burning smell after use. The comb immediately shuts off after not using to save energy and to prevent overheating. This hotcomb gets hotter than the ones in the local beauty supply store. I highly recommend this over any other brand! I am please with this product.  I love the temperature control.  The ability to rest down without touching any surface while it is hot.  After relaxing my hair and allowing it to dry I used this hot comb.  My hair stayed straight for a little over  two months.  With the relaxer only after one month it becomes frizzle. So I had bought this on Black Friday sale. Took it to my moms to use it on Christmas Day but totally forgot and my sister took it over. She mainly used it for her wigs but I wanted to use it to  press my natural hair. It’s great for straightening hair. She loves it My hair is wavey and my stylist never use a pressing comb. I took to salon and she tried it, and bought 2 for mixed race clients, it good for the shop to keep one these tools for special needs clients.  It straight any hair type. Also I travel with mind too. This is my second order as my friend saw my hair and wanted to know the secret to my smooth-pressed hair.  It was easy to use, and you have so many control levels, I tried all and there was no burning of my hair.  Love how my hair lasted a week with no damage.  Oh, this was my first time trying a pressing comb.  It does the job and I am in love!! This straightening comb heats up nicely and makes your hair shine. There are 2 reasons why I didn’t give a 5 star. 1. The controls are situated right where you will grab the comb to use it. It’s so easy to turn it off. 2. The stand kind of gets in the way when using it too. I guess you will get used to it. Overall, it’s a really good hair tool!",1,4,-3

My doctor recommended this to me after I was experiencing dry scalp.  You only need very little, gently rub into scalp, & let it sit for a few seconds. by the third wash no more itch or dandruff. For 30 years I have never been able to grow long hair until I discovered this.Every time my hair got over a few inches my scalp became itchy, shed on my clothes and sometimes bled.I tried every anti-dandruff product on the market, changed my diet and exercised however nothing worked.Everything changed when I discovered this, now I can have long hair and for the first time in my life my hair touches my shoulders. I am happy to finally have long hair with no scalp issues. Totally helped for something like cradle cap on my 7 year old when nothing else worked.  Texture is thick and a little goes a long way.  I use it with a round rubber scrubbing brush I got from Amazon I have suffered from horrible dandruff for years with my shirt being covered after a week from washing to no dandruff and I haven't washed my hair in 2 weeks still nothing I saw people buying this for fungal acne. It helped my chest acne disappear. But I can’t attest that it will work for everyone. Had used T-Gel for years which kept my dandruff/dermatitis manageable, but this past Winter it was magnitudes worse and T-Gel seemed to have no effect.  Noticeable results after first use; 75% better after second use three days later; dandruff 99% gone after 3rd use. It will work as its medically proven but Its a very strong shampoo that might cause hair loss. Ok, full transparency, I think I've been suffering from Seborrheic Dermatitis for years and just never knew it. Initially, when I started getting dandruff when I was a teenager, I just thought it was due to a dry scalp or product build-up that never washed out. Not the worst thing in the world, but still irritating. Getting older, however, it got much worse. Itching, redness, scaling all around my hair line (front and back), it was awful. Pieces of my skin would peel off  at my temples and the flakes would be very noticeable. I hated it so much. And sadly, not once did I think to ask a dermatologist about it.So,here we are years later, I still had horrible dandruff, itching, redness, the whole shebang. And then, my mother says one day, ""Well, you've always had eczema ever since you were a baby."" ... I never knew that. No one had told me that before. But in hindsight, yeah, it made so much sense. I just never considered that the case since I never noticed it anywhere else on my body that wasn't easily explained away. A little dryness here and there was nothing compared to my head. But that knowledge ultimately didn't help the scalp issue. Until, surprisingly enough, a YT ASMR video mentioned eczema/dermatitis and ketoconazale as a topical treatment for the hair. Interesting...Now, this past week, I feel like my scalp has been the worst it had been. Scaling and redness, itching pretty much non-stop, and that was after a shower using Head & Shoulders shampoo. So, I looked around and did some research on ketoconazale. It's a topical treatment for fungal skin infections like athlete's foot, jock itch, and yep, seborrhea (aka dry, flaking skin) and dandruff. Looking up the best rated shampoos with this main ingredient led me to Nizoral. And I am extremely happy to have found it.Again, full transparency, I've only used this shampoo today (day of writing this) and already I see an improvement. MAJOR improvement. I bought the 4 oz bottle, as I didn't want to commit to a larger one before trying it out, and a Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush (THIS IS KEY!!!). So, as soon as I had the bottle in my hands, I'm running for the shower. I used only Nizoral as my shampoo with Aussie Conditioner at the end. I used the brush to really scrub at the scaling and flakes all the way around my head, and it felt amazing. I've tried before with my nails to get the scales off, but this brush is 1000X better at it. I ""lather, rinse, repeat"" using the brush both times and I could really feel a difference in how my scalp felt. Sure, Head & Shoulders might have a better scent (I think this Nizoral shampoo is practically unscented or at least extremely mildly scented, not really noticeable), but this along with the brush helped my head and hair feel really clean. It lathered nicely, especially the second time, didn't make my hair feel too squeaky and stripped like some products do, and I don't notice any film or residue either now that my hair is mostly air-dried.After, when inspecting my head and feeling along the hairline, I can see the proof. No flakes!!! At little redness, but that was expected, but no huge scales or flakes stuck to my scalp, no patches to be felt behind my ears or at the nape of my neck, NOTHING!!! I... I am so happy to find this shampoo. If this happens every time I use it, I might be a customer for life. I'll add an edit in about 2 weeks to see if the product really held up or not.*** Edit:Okay, it's been 48 hours and I'm still very impressed. The itching across my scalp was cut down at least 80% or more. Very rarely did I feel an itch or try to scratch. Looking around my hairline again, I see a few tiny flakes, but that was mostly around the skin near my temples, my admittedly worst place for the scaling and irritation.Checking around the back of my neck and behind my ears saw massive improvement, I can't feel any patches or bumps at all around my hairline. My hair feels soft without any remaining residue to change its texture. It is a bit frizzy though, but that's mostly my own fault for not straightening it like I would normally, so I count that as non-related to the product.Overall, for a first time application and test, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I knew it wouldn't be an overnight cure-all for my problem, but the improvement I've seen in 48 hours over the past week is amazing! I'll add another update after a few more days.",1,1,0

The spring is surprisingly strong and they hold quite a bit of weight when clipped onto something...they won't limply fall off your hair. They are somewhat slippery because of the smooth metal, adds a bit of difficulty when you are holding onto a curl with one hand and trying to flip the clip the right way around with the other, but you can't have everything. Inexpensive, large quantity, metal, well made...that's good enough for me.The box I received is different from the one in the product photos, and the clips are a bit different too. The clips have a lengthwise crimp in them which I am thinking is to help it hold on to hair better than the perfectly flat ones shown in the photo. I bought these because on a recent trip to the mall I encountered one of those carts that sell random stuff, this one sold hair ribbons for babies and toddlers. It was $5.50 for two, they were so simple looking I thought ""I could probably make thse myself with some ribbon, a hair clip, some glue and a charm. I was right. I bought some ribbon (3/8""), hot glue gun ($4.00 for countless glue), some charms (about 15 cents each), and these clips, which are about 7 cents each... It cost me less than 30 cents per hair clip and were super easy. As for the actual product, it is just as good as any other hair clip you can buy anywhere else. They seem to catch a tiny bit on my toddler's hair, but that is true of any hair clip of this kind. I would recommend these. I bought these for a craft project I was working on. I used them to make bows for my daughter and for a bunch of her friends. These clips were perfect! They are not huge, but perfect for my toddler (for larger bows for bigger kids, you may want to go with a larger clip… but this was the perfect size for what I needed). They are holding up very well and I will be buying these again for sure! For the price, you can’t go wrong. The materials seems durable and not at all flimsy like other metal hair clips I’ve seen. For bow crafting projects, this is a winner.Update: February 2016I recently started using the DevaCurl method for maintaining my curly hair and I am using these clips to lift the hair at the crown while drying. I am impressed that I am able to still find great uses for these clips, years after buying them! Highly recommend!! These clips felt flimsier than I expected.  I haven't used them a lot so I can't testify to their durability, but the hinge pin is plastic instead of metal, and the overall feel is a little thin.  Of course, they were the cheapest option, so I shouldn't be too surprised.  I'm looking forward to seeing how they hold up to my 3 year old - if the majority of them don't break, then I'll definitely be back for more! I got these to make decorative hairclips for my girls and as gifts. I specifically wanted something with a hole down the middle so I could stitch on crocheted flowers. It does the job but the quality isn't the highest. The material is easy to bend. But the spring is strong enough to clamp down somewhat securely on hair. I would have preferred if it had a grippier texture or teeth along the edge perhaps so that it stays in smooth hair better. Overall it was a good purchase and the box comes with enough to last me a long time. The size is perfect for keeping a little girl's bangs out of her face. I curl my hair a lot so these are super useful for holding each curl until the end and to section out my hair. I had imagined they would have been larger like the salon type I see used but honestly I am glad they are small. This is so convenient for holding each curl and I like to part my hair into several small sections rather than three or four large ones when styling my hair. Its time consuming but these help the curls stay curly for a longer time. My hair does not curl well and by the time I finish one side of my head the others losing curl. I have only used these a few times but I put them in and sprayed my hair once I was done and my hair lasted a lot longer than normal! I was expecting much bigger clips, like the ones they use in the hair salons. These are much smaller, more similar to barrettes than hair styling clips.As a cosplayer, I need clips to hold both my own hair and my wig hair out of the way when styling. These do the job, but because they're smaller than I expected, I need to use twice as many, especially because my hair and wig hair is really thick.Make sure you know what you're paying for! These clips are good.  I read some reviews saying that some were rusted but mine are perfect, all of them work and I am happy with my purchase.",4,3,1

My old flat iron either burned my hair because it was too hot, or just made it frizzy by not being hot enough. Since I have Ethnic hair, going without flattening it for too long will make me look like someone rubbed a balloon across my scalp. So I had to deal with burning my hair for months before I found this flat iron.Ladies and gents. This will be the ONLY flat iron you will ever need in your life. I wish I were exaggerating, but I would buy this for everyone in the world if I could.PROS:1. It literally glides across your hair. You don't need to grip the iron tightly or tug.2. It gets VERY hot, but I doubt anyone would ever need for it to be on max. My hair is practically an afro after a shampoo, and the iron flattens my hair to near silk at usually only 350 degrees.3. It works on any hair type! I have relaxed and colored Ethnic hair. My mom has a mix of Ethnic and Native American hair. I've used this iron on her hair, as well as my friends who vary from Caucasian hair to natural Ethnic hair. Just change the heat settings accordingly, it it works like a charm.4. The price is a bargain. I've gone through 4 or 5 irons in the past 3 years. Considering I paid between $15-$30 for each, I wasted so much money. Ladies and gents, I know times are tough and money can be hard to come by, but if you're in the need for a new iron, don't settle for a cheapo one from the local drug store. Save up a bit of extra cash and invest in a high quality iron that will last you!5. It replaces a regular curling iron and is very versatile. My hair never took to curls well. They would last maybe a few hours then get really limp. This iron alone can give you a numerous amounts of salon-quality hairstyles with a bit of practice. It curls VERY well, and the curls lasted me for a week before I shampooed my hair again. They did fall limp after the third day, but with some hair spray, I'm sure they would last much longer. Also is really good for feathering your hair. My mom wraps her hair into a ""beehive"" style before bed, so she curls her hair with this iron and it helps with wrapping her hair before bed (if any of you wrap your hair at night, this is a plus!).6. The size of the iron is very ideal. I have very tiny hands (I actually have to wear children sized jewelry). In the picture, the iron looks really long and bulky, but the iron is made out of some kind of material that won't make the iron slip from your hands easily. And even though it's one of the smaller sizes of the H3000 series, it shouldn't take very long to iron unless you have absurdly long hair~ I would personally love to own a larger size iron, but this one is perfect.CONS:1. I'm not sure if my auto-turn off feature works. I left my iron on the bathroom counter when I had to go take care of a small emergency with my dog. When I came back almost 30min later, it was still ON. Nothing on the counter was burned since I had a pad underneath it, but it may be something worth looking at (I may just be the only one with this problem).2. The smell of the iron was...odd. It's not really a huge issue, it's just that when I unpacked the iron, it had a very strange ""old"" smell to it. Like it had been sitting in a musty, moldy garage for some time. I just wiped off the iron and the smell gradually went away, but it was just weird at first.Anywho~ That's all I have to say about this iron! I highly recommend this to anyone in dire need of a new one. Also, there are several women on YouTube who make regular hair tutorials using the HairArt H3000. That's actually how I found this one. Give them a look! You have to see it to believe it~ I’m a hairstylist and I love my HairArt flatiron. This flatiron  gives the hair a beautiful shine and straightens without using a lot of pulls through the hair. I work with predominately natural hair but  it’s great for all hair types. I definitely recommend this flatiron. Been flat ironing my hair for over 20 years and had many different flat irons! Some really expensive and some cheap and this is by far the best iron I’ve ever used!My hair is extremely hard to go straight but when I’m done straightening with this one it’s straight no frizz and feels silky too! Exceeded expectations on my natural!  Creates a straight shiny finish I'm writing this review 3 years--nearly to the day--after purchasing this flat iron. Having purchased this Hairart Ceramic flat iron to replace a GHD that worked well, but died far too soon (within a year), I was ecstatic to find that the Hairart worked just as well as the GHD for a fraction of the cost. After 3 years of consistent use (4-6 days per week) this flat iron is still functioning great. I have long (mid-back length) hair that is thick and prone to frizz and I don't have any trouble getting my hair straight with this flat iron in low-to-mid humidity. I live in the Pacific Northwest, and my hair will stay straight throughout the day without trouble. However, during a week in southern California my hair would not completely straighten due to high humidity. Therefore I'm not completely confident people in the south or the Midwest would have great results with this flat iron. For me, I'm considering buying a second Hairart flat iron and keeping my first as a backup. After 3 years the only wear-and-tear that I've noticed is that the grip where you hold the flat iron has begun to heat up after 25+ minutes of use when using it on the highest setting (450, I believe).PROS:- cost- durability (3 years!)- effective and efficient for long/thick hair- doesn't catch, snag or pull hair- smooths and flattens for 24+ hrs in low-to-mid humidity- super fast heat-upCONS:- less effective in high humidity- the grip may heat up after extended use on the highest setting- no auto shut-off Now I only allow my mother to do my hair because she's a professional hair stylist and she gets my hair Bone Straight just how i like it.I'm a VERY PICKY woman when it comes to my hair... if it's not bouncy, flowy shiny and my ROOTS aren't straight then I'm unhappy. Now I've never bought an electrical flat iron because I've never had to and I didn't know which flat iron would be Best to invest in seeing the fact that there are alot of good flat irons out there. So I did my research, looked at reviews and watched some youtubes and i decided to go with the hairart because when I saw black women using it on youtube there hair wasn't stiff, it had that bouncy,flowy shiny look that I was looking for and i didn't really see that in other leading flat irons. I am an african amerian/indian mix woman, my hair is very curly, slightly course and thick therefore I needed a flat iron that gets really hot and that can give me that bouncy, flowy and shiny look.

Retired now are her plastic-handled cheapos bought from a local discount store that didn't cut all that well and wound up causing her hands to cramp and become tired.These are an impressive pair of scissors that should stand up to many years of use. They are adjustable in that there is a screw at the hinge instead of a rivet, so if they should become loose after use, you should be able to tighten the screw. My wife says they are really comfortable and cut well. These are a nice addition to the 7-1/2"" shears we also purchased from the same manufacturer.The quality is exceptional and they are packaged nicely in a folded sheet plastic box with a molded tray which can be used for storage if you are careful in opening and closing it.One of the reasons I purchased was that the manufacturer offers free lifetime sharpening of the product. More information on this can be found on their website. It appears that the only cost to you would be the shipping to get the product to them. They also have a ""sharpening tracker"" that will send out email updates as they process your product for service. I bought these shears because I am trying to grow my hair out, and every time i go in for a trim they cut too much hair off. So my solution was these shears, which i use to trim my slit ends and let my hair grow.I keep the shears from becoming dull by keeping them in the package they came in when i dont use them. They are as sharp now as they were when they arrived, but if i ever feel like they have dulled, tweezerman will sharpen them for free. Having that option helped me make up my mind when researching which shears to get, since i wouldn't need to purchase new ones once these dulled.When i compared the hair stand cut with these shears and one cut with regular scissors, the strand cut with scissors had a rigid/spliting end while the strand cut with these shears was more defined with no noticeable splitting or rigidness. I should mention i have thin curly hair, so individuals with different hair type might experience a different result.I don't know if i would use only these for my hair, but i do find them useful for the split end trims between my twice a year haircuts. I always end up getting roped into cutting my sons hair. Why is it always mom? I usually pre-cut his hair before I switch to clippers because it's thick, dense and curly...it's kind of like shearing a sheep! I also clean up around the edges and around his ears with these. I've also been known to cut my own hair....why not, it's only hair, it WILL grow back. These are fine for my purposes, they are sharp, small for my small hands and seem to keep an edge through many uses. They are pretty small. I'm glad that the other reviews pointed this out before I bought them. I have small-ish lady hands, and the handle holes are just right for me. The handle holes would be too small for my husband to use. The blade length is also pretty short, which for my purpose is all I need. If you just need some small hair trimming shears, these are great. If you are looking a professional level hair shears, don't buy these, you will be disappointed. These are well suited for quick trims and haircuts at home. It can be a bit weird to handle at first, b/c the finger holes are not the same. Once you get used to it, it feels more natural in your hand and you begin to notice it less. Since it is a bit shorter than many sets, it is ideal for kid's trims and to store for use in a kit or for road travel. Overall, a good quality set and should last a long time. I got these when I had super long hair (I have since cut 12 inches off!) to trim my own split ends in between haircuts, because my hair was a bit damaged being that long. I wasn't horribly impressed with these scissors. I wish they were a bit sharper. Also, I could see a small sliver of space in between the blades when they were together, making me think they aren't that great for cutting hair. I probably would not purchase these again, but they do work and I will continue to use them. I purchased these for at home cutting. I'm 6' and 220 lbs and they can be a little tight in the fingers but now that I think about it, it's probably better to have that grip then be too loose but it's noticeable. The length is decent but I would have probably opted for a 7"" if available. The quality is there though and for the price it's worth a buy for most. I have been sharpening and adjusting scissors for 20 years and these Twizzerman scissors are the worst scissors I have ever received. The screw that holds them together has no locking point on them nor are they peened. Peened is what the REALLY cheap scissor manufacturers do to hold the scissor adjustment correctly. $20 scissors have a lock nut or tapered threads to ensure stability. Twizzerman scissors DO NOT HAVE ANY of that. They come loose, cut badly and the label says stainless steel but the scissors are magnetic. Stainless steel is not magnetic. Plus the package says stainless steel on one side and nickel plated on the other. The manufacturer does not even know what they are making or selling. The thumb finger hole is to small and the seller provided ONLY a front photo so you could not see the extreme low quality on the back. These scissors are not worth $2 let alone $20 plus excessive shipping charges. I strongly recommend you look into the Sally Hansen brand because clearly the Pakistanny's know a tremendous more about scissors than the Chinese Twizzerman scissors.",2,5,-3

I purchased this one to have a spare but mostly because the bristles looked smaller and I thought it would be better for my short hair. The handle is skinny and slippery so it's not that easy to hold when teasing. Lastly, it doesn't tease that well or give me the volume I expected. Pros:  I like the natural boar bristles, as they are great for smoothing out tangles after backcombing.  I've used it for a couple years and have no issues with losing bristles.  I also prefer the wood handle (opposed to plastic) in being somewhat eco-conscious.  The handle is slim and doesn't take a lot of room inside my work handbag.  Even if I don't use it for teasing, I like to have it for touch ups at my scalp and ends throughout the day, because my large boar bristle is too big to tote around reasonably.  The handle is a perfect shape with indentations where your thumb would fit while teasing.Cons:  The black paint wears off eventually, especially if you get hair product on it.  When I disinfect and wash the bristles area, the black paint started running.  Keep this in mind if you periodically clean your brush bristles of dust and buildup. I've always dreamed of having amazing teased/voluminous hair but I've never been able to achieve it myself.  As many times as I've had people try to show me how to tease it with a comb, I never was able to create a tease that stayed until this brush.After watching a few videos online about teasing I decided to invest in this brush as I was told this would create a tease with little effort and less hair damage and they were right!  I used it this weekend for the first time and I was able to tease my hair in less than 5 minutes and it stayed ALL NIGHT!I have very fine silky hair which is great most of the time but not when you want body and this brush was a great fix .  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! I think this brush does miracles! My hair is so thin and i always had problems with teasing my hair and giving it  volume that'll last. I bought so many other brushes and their bristles will fall out, very poor quality. And teasing my hair with a teasing comb wasnt working at all... it breaks your hair and you have to do alot more teasing in order to get desired results. This brush gives you the perfect volume with little effort! Its a great quality brush and will not break your hair as much.This brush is shaped to tease as close as possible to the scalp and work your way up, you dont have to tease furosiously.  It does wat it says it'll do,im very happy with this product! A great little teasing comb for teasing up that snookie poof or creating those bumps or extra body you've been dying to wear. It does an alright job, although I'm beginning to wonder why I didn't just stick to a plain old rattail comb.. it seems to do the same thing and is a lot cheaper. I did notice this comb sheds a little bit here and there.. stiff little red boars hair bristles and of course they're teased into your hair so it's a P.I.T.A. to get them out... I have really fine babysoft hair that I have to tease nearly everyday to give it a little body. This comb cuts the time it usually takes me to do my hair with other teasing combs in half. So far I really like it. My only complaint is the the little red bristles seem to fall out quite a bit which is some what annoying when you have to pick them out of your hair before going anywhere. Other than that it works wonders. I have been wanting this brush since it came out but the shipping was more than the brush in other sites. I ordered from Amazon and received one that was missing black paint. I called the Big Daddy and spoke to someone from her home(I won't use names) what a doll.  She sent me a new one but my address came out wrong, she had a difficult time to accomodate me (with Fed Ex) but she did not give up. The new one is great. This brush is fantastic, and I owe her a BIG Thank You. I suspect that my expectations were really high for having the Marilyn Brush give me a pouf where needed.  The brush just does not cooperate with poufing my ultra fine blond hair by teasing.  I think this brush would work for thicker hair, just not fine hair like mine.  I believe that the brush is a good quality brush, too, with its boar hairs.  Although I have felt disappointed in what the brush can do for me personally, I do believe it's the major factor of hair type that is in play here, not the brush.",2,3,-1

However, when I massaged it into my scalp and on the ends of my hair and left for a few hours before I wash my hair, I got amazing results! My hair is incredibly soft, feels strong and shiny, not as many flyaways as usual… even my gray hairs seem to be moisturized enough! For me, this will be my new favorite pre-shampoo routine. I used to sell this line of product, but I've never tried this particular item. The conditioner is great, so I decided to try this item. I was not disappointed. Not everyone sells this line of so I'm grateful that I could find it here.  I was shocked at the color and texture, green and appeared to be hair grease. Once I worked it into my hair, my hair was beautiful and manageable for days. Perfect for black hair. It will make your hair soft and grow fast. Smell good too. I want to preface this by saying that I am an idiot, learn from me. My hair is not the type of hair that this product is made for, but I read a comment from someone who used it as a pre-shampooing treatment. So, I ordered it anyway and tried to use it this way. BIG. BIG mistake. I put too much in assuming I could just wash it out.  It made my hair look simultaneously greasy/ wet/ shellacked. I lost count of how many times I had to wash it to get it out. I used two clarifying shampoos, one regular shampoo, and finally - Dawn dish soap. After 300 washes, I finally got it out. So for those who have coarser hair I will say - less is more. For those who do not…. Give it a hard pass. Learn from my idiocy. Has dry from coloring curly hair that I straightener occasionally. This item is very greasy. Placed a small amount in my hair and my roots would get real greasy but my ends of my hair will look dry still. I thought this product would moisturize it and help with the dryness of my hair. But it doesn't often it. My ponytail will look dry with a greasy look to it. Then overnight my hair will be mattered. So this is no for me",2,5,-3

I like to switch shampoos during the week and not just depend on the same one every single day.  So I use this product once or twice a week and love the way it adds a little bit of body to my fine and thinning hair! I used a Volumizing Shampoo for almost twenty years that worked magic on my hair.  It was hard to get on the East Coast and I ended up buying it via the internet from hair dressing shops on the West Coast.  About five years ago, I heard it was being discontinued by the company and I managed to purchase enough to last me this long.  Now, the time has come to find a new Volumizing Shampoo that will make my very soft, straight hair look like it has some body.  I've found out this is easier said than done.This shampoo, which a national publication said women with naturally white hair loved, failed me in a big way.  It doesn't do much for my hair and when I used its Thickening crème, which is supposed to make my hair look even better, I end up with hair with a small amount of body but without its usual shine.I don't like the smell of it but I'll use it for a while, without the styling crème since I think that's what's making the shine disappear.  This is only the third shampoo I've tried so I may have miles to go before I sleep in my bed with hair that has proper volume and shine but I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth! :DOne note: the shampoo doesn't suds much but keep in mind that no shampoo has suds by nature.  They put a chemical into it to make it suds up because people want their shampoo to make suds.  Secondly, when you rinse it out of your hair, your hair won't squeak, even though it's totally rinsed.  For some odd reason, that really bothers me but all shampoos are different as is my not-so-lovely-hair.  I have read great reviews of the shampoo so if you have limp hair, I'd say to give it a try.  Maybe you won't have stubborn hair like mine!BTW, the company that made my original shampoo eventually went out of business!  Figures it would! I was losing my hair due to stress and my doctor told me one of her patients said this helped her with hair loss.  I tried it and liked it but the stores quit selling it.  Glad to find it on Amazon! Works well This hair amplifying shampoo sure does it's job. The moment after I dry my hair, I instantly feel an increased thickness in my hair. I have trouble maintaining thickness in my hair because I have really thin hair and the genetic grey streak doesn't help. But, this shampoo has definitely helped. It doesn't have the best smelling substance, but it does what it is intended to do. I give this product 4 stars because the thickness effect doesn't last as long as I would want it too and because it doesn't have a fragrance-like smell. Compare to ""Bumble and bumble"" thickening shampoo and thickening conditioner.  Samy's FAT hair looks and feels similar to ""Bumble and bumble"" -- and with my fine hair leaves it a bit thicker and fuller; plus, to a small degree better feel and resilence.My ""Bumble and bumble"" shampoo and conditioner bottles are 8 fluid ounces each; compared to Samy's FAT Hair at 10 fluid ounces each.  Samy's FAT Hair shampoo and conditioner cost less than ""Bumble and bumble"" shampoo and conditioner.While I would rate ""Bumble and bumble"" thickening shampoo & conditioner 5 stars, on my fine hair Samy's FAT Hair thickening shampoo & conditioner has the ""leading edge.""Since each person's hair is different, of course, you need to try both and be the judge of what works best for you. the best service and product.  thank you for all your help this seller is amazing no questions asked helped me out with product replacement right away send me a new bottle ofSamy Fat Hair""0"" Calories Amplifying Shampoo, 10 Ounce..

Those old hairpins, made in the late 1890s, are all-metal and have no protective rubber tips. They held my hair securely. But over the years, I'd lost one here, one there - until finally I needed to get some more pins. I ordered this package of Diane pins because it includes three sizes, seemingly offering one of the best values for the money.The pins are adequately flexible and are sturdy enough, especially when it comes to the larger-sized ones. But as I thought, I found I had to modify them in order to get them to securely hold my mass of hair in place. Like almost all hairpins manufactured in the last 50 years or so, these are made with rubber tips - something similar to the aglets found on the ends of shoelaces. Unfortunately, those rubber tips cause the hairpins to slide too easily out of place and fall to the floor.So I had to get busy. I used wire cutters or tin-snips to snip off those rubber tips, especially on the large-size hairpins. Then I used a file to round off the ends so they wouldn't scratch the scalp. With this adjustment, the pins do stay securely in place.If you have longer, thinner hair, you might also find that you want to get rid of those rubber tips that tend to send the pins sliding down. But again, be sure to file the tips after you've snipped off the rubber ends so you don't scratch yourself. It's nice to get a variety pack of different sizes. The hair pins will work just fine, but they are not something that will last for a long time. After a few weeks of consistent use, the black color will rub off and the nubs at the end of the hair pins will start to come off, making it risky to use because you can scratch your head! Assess them before each use so that you can throw out the worn out ones. We use them weekly for dance classes. You'll definitely need to replace them every couple of months.  I use hair pins every day and I love these pins. The negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to pay attention to what they bought and assumed they were getting BOBBY PINS, which is a completely different thing with a completely different purpose. These are U-shaped hair pins, which are used for buns and updos. I love the size assortment, because I can use the two longer sizes to pin up my natural hair, while the small ones work great for my daughter's hair or to pin a wig down. I have long hair (mid back) and I can put my hair in a bun with just 2-3 of the long pins. The best part about these pins is that the ball ends are very smooth, and do not catch in the hair the way some cheap pins do. They are also fairly sturdy and hold their shape very well. I will order several more packs because it is an unbeatable value.EDIT: When I first wrote the review I had only used the pins once. Since writing the review I have discovered that these pins can only be used once or twice before all of the black coating flakes off. I still haven't had issues with the ball ends snagging hair, and for the low price I certainly didn't expect a durable, premium product, so I'm still giving three stars. I use these daily to put my hair in a bun that I wear all day and even sleep in. They are very comfortable, and if I've positioned them just right I can't even feel them. I bought these by accident but I am so glad I did. I have long, thin hair and regular bobby pins don't always hold it in place and then I have to redo them all the time. With these hair pins I can tuck any wisp of hair away. It's great for pinning my bangs back when I have a ponytail. And when I do a bun, I can tuck in any shorter bits really easily without affecting the overall shape.I've never used hair pins before but I am converted. they really are non damaging. I find them less painful than any other method of barrette or slide because these pins distribute the weight over a wider section of my scalp. I also feel like I could pull off a really soft elegant updo with these pins and that it would actually last.How to use.... I take a piece of hair, twist it if I want to and then place the section between the pins. I place it where I want it to go and slide the pin in sideways. Another way to do it is by flipping it over completely and securing it back into the original section of hair - this creates additional volume and poof, something I need... Because they don't disturb the rest of the hair there's no need to worry that they will cause other curls of hair to poke out. They're so easy to use I can refresh my hair do without a mirror.My only qualm is, i wish they were available in brown. The pins are pretty much invisible once you slide them in but still, i couldn't find a brown version and that would work better with my hair colour. There's a coating over the metal with a soft tip end. When the soft tip end is gone the metal end can rub and irritate the scalp or skin. It can probably be fixed with some fingernail polish and dipped several times to make another tip. These are great for messy buns, french twists and updos. Three sizes help for different hair lengths. they still work it is great",2,4,-2

It’s not cheap, but for me it’s worth the price. Doesn’t leave your hair feeling stiff. I think they have changed the formula of this hair spray! It has always been my favorite, because aerosol sprays dry out and frizz my hair. Maximum pump spray used to hold better, without stiffnes and smell different. I really don't like the smell, but others think it smells fine on me, so I will probably keep using it. Because, frankly, it is the best non aerosol on the market. I Love how it defines and separates  my curls!! However...the fragrance is way too strong and overwhelming.  In my opinion, it smells like a very strong ""old lady"" perfume. It stands out over my perfume or body spray. I have used this spray for years and they have changed the formula several times.  Each time it smells worse and gets stickier. Bummer, but it is still the best I can find for a pump spray. Nexxus hairspray is now my go-to hairspray.  After having a terrible build up from Suave hairspray I started looking around.  Thats when I came across Nexxus finishing spray.  Just a couple of quick squirts in my hands and I run it through my hair and my hair has the perfect stiffness to keep up with me all day.  I'm a person who needs to run their hands through their hair and this hairspray doesn't let me down.  Also, no more nasty build up!  Even my hairdresser remarks that I have a healthy, not artificial looking bounce and lift to the top of my hair where I apply the Nexxus. I have been using expensive hair sprays in an effort to control my very thin going-grey hair and they all seemed to leave a heavy film on my hair and left it ""dried out"".  I decided to try a less expensive one and this one really works well for me!!!  It holds the style well, through all kinds of weather.  My only criticism is that it still leaves a film on my hair, like the others but so far it is the best I have found and will continue to buy it. I love the previous version of this Maxximum hairspray but it has been harder and harder to find in local stores.  I thought I would try this newer one and found that I like it a lot.  My hair is fine and any heavy hairspray just weights it down...but this Maxximum Nexxus spray works as well as the previous version...in fact, it may be the previous version.  The only difference I note is a faint fragrance  with this one and I like the added scent.  So this is a winner for me. My wife has been using Nexxus hair spray for many years as recommended by her hair stylist. We moved last summer and the stores where we now live do not stock Nexxus. I checked and sure enough Amazon has the product. We how have it shipped every other month automatically. The Amazon price is cheaper than it was in stores in our old home town. No state tax here in NC either!This is turn resulting in our checking Amazon prices for other grocery/household items we use regularly. We are now up to 6 products we get every month or every-other month.  Thanks Amazon I have been using Nexxus Maxximum spray for many years but no more.  Seems like every time there is something that works they mess with the formula and completely screw it up!

I use it along with Kerastase Elixir Ultime, which I really love. finally the prodcut appeared. this smells like soap. i’d like a refund Fake product. Wrong color liquid so knew right away. Tons of people are saying this product is fake yet, it has not shown signs of that.Let's start with the smell; I would have to admit that it's not my favorite, it's almost orange-like in nature but, it is light and does go away. Most lux products have some sort of smell associated with them.Secondly; the actually product did seem to work well with my hair but, you NEED a conditioner on hand because this product dried my hair out in the show, which I was not expecting. It could be my hair type (oily).Thirdly; I have a sensitive scalp and this product hasn't hurt it in any way.After the shower, and dried hair... I love this product. I thought I hated it in the shower because of how dried it made my hair but, it was worth it.Would I recommend? Yes! Treat your hair with this product.

This stuff works. My split ends were drastically reduced within three days, and my hair breakage is no longer a nightmare. In fact, before using this product, an alarming amount of broken hairs would litter my floor bathroom leaving me horrified.So yes, it works. However, even since using this product my scalp has had so much dandruff. Perhaps it is my chemistry in relation to that of the mender. All I know is that my hair has been a winter wonderland since using this. Also, like others have mentioned, the mending process does seem to clump your hair together, making it looks unwashed like the greasy haired rebel smoking at the gas station. Another low of this product, is its smell. I come from a tropical country, so coconuts are nothing new to me, but this smell is overpowering - even having a weird scent of hemp at times as a relative told me.At the end of the day, the product did what it said it would, and has been the first to give me great results; hence I like this product despite those reservations. Although the price here on Amazon has doubled since the last time I bought it, this product contains a generous 6 oz and you don't have to use a lot to get results. I emphasize that you don't HAVE TO, but it is moisturizing, yet not greasy, I love to put a generous amount on my hair at night before bed and I wake up to soft and silky hair.  The delicious smell is very relaxing and should improve anyone's mood.  I was getting this item thru Subscribe & Save, although that option is no longer available as I write this.  But I would renew my subscription if the price became reasonable again & subscription became an option again.  For me, this is the best styling cream-type product I have tried and it is one weapon in my anti-tangle arsenal, along with multiple additional products, mostly made by Organix & Nexxus.  If you have issues with tangles, dryness, flyaways, static, and or frizz, give it a try!  The retail price is very reasonable for the excellent quality of the item. I really like this split ends mender. I love the bottle and how the product comes out. I also love the smell. When I put it in my towel dried curly hair it immediately made my hair soft and moisturized. It also made my split ends less noticeable but they were still there. Later on in the day my hair did dry a little and became less soft but not so much to give this product a bad review. I like using this with the coconut anti-breakage serum from the same line. I mix it together with it and it makes the product work better at keeping my hair softer longer. I would recommend this to anyone with curly dry hair like mine or just someone with dry hair. All in all a good leave in. My hair is pretty thin. It does get split ends rather quickly after cutting or any type of treatments, so I thought I would try a few split ends menders and such. This has a pleasant smell and isn't gooey or sticky. It seemed to have stopped the ends from splitting further, but as for ""mending"", I didn't see any of that. It did get a little crunchy if I let it get too thick at the ends, or waited too long to brush it, but other than that, it was very nice. I love all OGX products I have tried! This stuff smells awesome and has worked very well for me so far. If you have thin/fine hair, you hardly need any of this. If you use too much or if your hair is not wet enough, it will leave your hair sticky, but here's how I use it: I very lightly towel dry my hair after a shower, then spray in a leave-in conditioner (i use the hask placenta spray). Then I comb my hair out, and this leaves the ends pretty wet. Leaving the ends wet like this, I use a dime-size amount of this mixed with a little OGX argan oil and apply just to the ends of my hair. This leaves my ends REALLY soft and looking very healthy. This is another great OGX product :) This stuff really works!!!! I ordered 6 bottles and I am going to order about 20 bottles more.  I am African-American with natural C4/C3 hair. My hair was extremely damaged from bleaching, stress, dryness and it was literally falling out when I would run my fingers through it.  In addition to using this product I also clipped my ends, had a deep conditioning, and stared a vitamin regimen and it has stopped my hair from breaking.  The Coconut Milk leaves your hair feeling soft and strong, it does not leave a residue at all and it has really strengthened my hair. I recommend it. It works better then all products I have used in my hair combined.  It really will stop you from getting split ends and it will stop your hair from breaking especially if it is damaged from bleach, dryness, and stress.  BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WON'T REGRET IT!! Pros: Smells great and isn't too stickyCons: I didn't really notice any difference in my split endsOverall: It's a relatively affordable hair product. I have thick (very thick) hair, and so I probably used a bit more at a time than what most other people would need. For its stated purpose of mending split ends, I can't say that I've gotten any good results (at least not noticeably so). However, I let a friend use it once who has very fine hair and she stated that using this hair serum after a shower was perfect for increasing her styling ease. Maybe this product is better for someone with thinner hair then? This product really does work! I'm naturally a brunette and for about 10 years I have been highlighting my hair and flat ironing it about 4-5 times a week. I decided to go brunette again and noticed that my hair isn't exactly healthy by any means (brown hair really shows spilt-ends!!!!) While I know the only solution for split-ends is a trim. I got this product to help me out in between and I must admit, it really works! It somehow masks the look of my split ends and I haven't been getting as many since I started using this. I actually really like a tropical scent, so I like the way it makes my hair smell and its really subtle.",5,3,2

I wish it didn't mat down my beard hair and tangle it all up plus I wish it would wash out slowly over time because I spayed it in after my shower and washed my beard the next day and it was washed out so buyer be ware No wonder they sell it in a two pack also one bottle barely covers my entire beard and non of the hair on my head so save your money it will work out well in a pinch though Be sure to cover areas before spraying! It will get everywhere. I love the color and it even covers gray and really dark hair, but it’s really pigmented and it permanently stained our toilet seat as I used it in our small bathroom without covering it. This hair color was perfect for when you need a bright color for one night. My hair is a somewhat darker brown and I was worried the red wouldn't be vibrant enough. This stuff is bold and spot on! The scent is also more pleasant than the stuff you get at spirit halloween, it smelled more like hair product than paint. Only down side is it rubs off on EVERYTHING. By the end of the night my hands were red and I had spots all over where my hands had touched. Nevertheless it was perfect for what I needed. Beautiful color, easy to apply, and washed out very easily, just added an extra wash to my normal shower routine. Would definitely use again. Keeping in mind that we were in the rain, and it was windy all day (leftovers from the hurricane), this provides AWESOME coverage to dark hair and was easy to wash out.  It didn’t run even in the heaviest rain we walked in and it didn’t stain my husbands skin or hair. It absolutely does make a mess on clothing and it has a perfume sent that prevented my husband from doing his goatee like planned.  Use a towel to cover your clothes, do it outside in a not so windy place, and use a wet washcloth to wipe off skin. Go for it! It’s a great product! The color is bright and looks good. It made my muppet costume complete.Spray it outside. I'm still cleaning up the room where I sprayed it. Easy to remove, used on my daughters hair as well as my wig. My wife used this on her dark brown hair for her Jem and The Hologram’s Halloween costume. It worked well.",1,1,0

I purchased my first one 10 years ago and I finally started to die. Found it again and love it. This one has a higher temp setting. I highly recommend!!! heats and then stops heating, the heating time is not enough to iron hair. i had to return it unfortunately. i had a similar product/brand before that work for me well, unfortunately it broke (it stopped heating at all) after less than a year. i bought it from a hair  salon and couldn't take it back.  I wanted to replace it with the same product, but  this however was not it. what i liked about the original cricket friction free was that I used it like an ironing ""brush"", it did not kill all the waves, the hair did not look lifeless (licked by a dog) as other irons of higher temperature do to my hair, but it helped with the frizz and it gave a nice tamed shape. I have thick hair, wavy/curly, I like some curl or wave but want to tame it a bit. The product I originally had did this. But this one, although is the same brand and temperature, failed to do the same. it heats up to the highest temperature and then shuts off the heating enough to get cold and not do anything to my hair. The hair gets pulled and what is supposed to be friction free iron becomes a piece of cold iron tangled in my hair. Very nice product, easy to use and handle.  I find that my short hair slips through the plates easily if I don't apply extra pressure to the plates to hold it in.  The plates are ""floating"" which is nice for those with longer, thicker hair but mine is pretty short and tends to slip through.  I just need a bit of poof added to my really straight hair and this is helpful. I already had this flat iron.  Wanted another one for work, so I knew the product before I bought a second one.  I can no longer get this iron retail.  But for my african american hair, it not only smoothes, but it keeps it very straight even in humidity (and I Iive in Houston, TX).  Also, no breakage when using this flat iron.  Recommend it to anyone with thick course hair. I had one of these for seven years - a pretty good life span for a flat iron.  I bought a replacement 8 months ago and it has already broken!  One of the sides doesn’t heat up anymore.  Too bad -  I like this because it has an adjustable temperature (and it gets very hot) and it can be locked closed, so it's easy to store.  The surface area is just the right size: bigger than a travel-sized one, but not so big that it's unwieldy.  It also does not leave my hair with odd crimps in it like other ones I've had. I was given this straightener by my sis in law.  I loved it!  It's not too small, but perfect for my thin hair.  My hair had less static then when I used other straighteners.  It broke (after many uses.  She used it for years, then I used it for years) so I got a ""knock off"" Cricket from a salon beauty store.  I did not like it at all so I gave it to my 7 yr old daughter.  Even she said, ""mom, this doesn't work as well as your Cricket""  so I had to buy another cricket.  Love it! I love this flat iron! This is my second cricket. My first one lasted for nine years. I have fine van hair and I keep the temperature on 180° and it does not burn my hair at all and does a great job! A pretty great product and has all the heat settings you would want. I have thick hair and should have bought a 1.5 inch. It also heats a tad slow and gets pretty hot on the upper handle.",4,2,2

My scalp cannot handle anything foamy. Turns out my skin can't either, so I've stopped using anything that foams on my scalp and skin. It's just too drying. I'm also hyper-sensitive to dimethicone, so I avoid that, too. I now wash my hair with conditioner (""co-washing,"" as it's often called.) My husband has the same issue with his scalp and kept going to the dermatologist for prescription shampoos, which didn't help in the long run, and his problem has been solved by co-washing, too. I still get flare-ups (especially in winter) so I keep products like this one around. But for the most part, the battle has been won.*I have suffered from a dry, flaky, itchy scalp all of my adult life. If you have the same problem, like me, you've probably tried everything you can get your hands on to cure it.I've tried dandruff shampoos but they made things worse - because I don't have dandruff, and because most contain SLS, which my scalp (and skin) is highly reactive to. I've tried shampoos with salicylic acid and they did not help. Tea Tree Oil does nothing for me, nor do products with mint, eucalyptus or apple cider. I've used scalp conditioners, sera, rinses, masks, you-name-it, and none solved the problem.I have found a few things that do help. First, I stopped using any products with SLS or other Lauryl/Laurate deriviatives, and turned into a major label-reader. Just making this adjustment solved about 80% of the problem.However, I still have flare-ups (they're worse in winter) that need to be treated. I found 1 shampoo that was nothing short of miraculous until it was discontinued, then a replacement, which eventually disappeared, too. Then I found this. It's been life-changing, really, and I always have it in my arsenal.I use it in 2 different ways: For minor flare-ups or as a preventative I mix it with my conditioner (about 20 drops total for my entire scalp.) I apply it as closely to my scalp as I can get and concentrate on problem areas. I rub it into my scalp best I can, then leave it on for 10-20 minutes while I shower. (You can apply it directly to your scalp but I find that hard to do when my hair is wet, since I can't really feel where it's going. It also takes longer to do it this way.)For major flare-ups I apply it directly to my scalp at night and wash it out the following day. This is really, really effective, both immediately and for the next few days. In the winter I do this every 1-2 weeks or so. It's a bit messy and time consuming but worth it. This method also fills my bedroom with the product's herbal scent, which lingers as it necessarily gets absorbed into my pillow as I sleep. I rather like the smell, though, so that's not much of a problem and it does wash out.One commonality between all 3 products that have worked for me is a high concentration of rosemary and sage, so I'm rather convinced that those are the 2 miracle-workers for me. (I've even steeped rosemary in boiling water and dumped it over my head in a fit of desperation - it felt really good :) This oil does have a very strong herbal smell (think essential oils/tinctures or Aveda products) which judging by reviews, some people have a real objection to. I barely notice it myself and my husband's come to like it.I might add that I occasionally use Giovanni Wellness System Shampoo with Chinese Botanicals and this works for immediate relief and is certainly easier to use than Phytopolleine. However, it strips the crap out of my hair so I only use it when I don't have time to do the Phyto routine. There is also a scalp serum in the same Giovanni line that I wouldn't recommend. It has a very strange texture, and combined with the packaging is impossible to get directly onto your scalp. I also needed to use so much of it that I only got a couple of uses out of the bottle. Every month I go in for hair color. Afterwards my head itches and burns. This is the only thing that totally eliminates that issue. Tiny bottle, but the dispenser is easy to use to run through hair onto scalp and a bottle lasts me for months, maybe a year. Smells a bit herbal. I love it. By the way, I only have to use it on the same day as the hair color. After that, no problem. I will try my best to be short and sweet in this review:The bottle opening is a small tip (akin to a bottle of tacky glue, or like a mini-diner-ketchup-bottle) and this is what makes part of this so awesome. I have very thick very curly hair and more often than not its really difficult to get treatments on the spots I need them most. The thin tipped nozzle on this baby really helps. I was able to get even distribution in a cinch.The smell is not bad. Contrary to what I read the smell is not very strong or lasting. You may not like the scent if you do not like more natural smells, or the smells of such oils as camphor, eucalyptus, and mint. The closest comparison I can think of is tiger balm, but even then, its not nearly as strong as that. The smell (for me at least) went away after washing it off.This treatment helps. I've used it twice and already I feel a lot more relief and my scalp was clear for two days (which is actually a long time for me)The price is high, but for how many uses you'll get it's worth it. You don't use much per usage and the tip applicator means no waste. Just don't store the bottle on its side.Did I mention that it arrived a whole 5 days before I expected?5/5 stars: this product is a great alternative to harsh chemicals and prescriptions, smells great (IMO) and is of good value. Basically, this stuff is liquid gold.It's super strong, so even using it 1x/week the bottle lasts a few months.  The smell is pleasing, but quite strong -- if you don't like herbaceous/botanical scents, this might not be for you.Best results I've found come from sectioning damp hair and then applying directly to the scalp and gently massaging in.  Leave on for 15-20 min.  Better yet -- wrap a warm damp towel around your head for maximum effect.  Either way, you will feel it working.  Then shampoo out.You will immediately notice your hair is shinier and healthier looking and much easier to style.  I don't have any scalp conditions, but I would imagine that regular use of this would resolve most minor irritations/dermatoses in just a few weeks. I had a lot of built up products stuck on my scalp because I use dry shampoo and hair spray on a regular basis. I had a really bad dandruff problem and itchiness and my hair dresser suggested this product. At first, you put it on and massage your scalp and wait 20 minutes. It has a very strong minty smell. I have to say that it literally stink up my studio apartment. Once I washed my hair, the smell was still strong until after a couple days it disappeared. But it DID WORK MARVELOUSLY. It made the built up on my scalp detached. After that, it increased my dandruff problem so I would use this product paired with Phyto Intense dandruff shampoo. Thats what I did and got rid of my problem! So really great product and I recommend it to everyone. With the advent of all the scalp treatments out there this has been a tried and true for me.  I have very thick hair and sebhorreic dermatitis on my scalp.  So I mix a small amount of this into my shampoo.  I also add a few drops of tea tree oil.  This keeps my scalp fresh, and free of bumps or itch.  This product works wonders for any itchiness between wash days when applied directly to the scalp before bedtime.  It does have a fresh smell of rosemary and peppermint essential oils.  I like it but if you don’t care for that kind of thing it may not be for you.",3,1,2

As I used it, I felt that it hasn't really benefited my hair that much. I didn't think it did anything at all, really. But then! I finally found my method - and when I have about a couple teaspoons left lol, so I'll definitely buy it again.Anyhoo, I use Suave Almond Oil and Shea Butter conditioner also as a leave-in and, while my hair is still soaking wet, I take 4-6 sections and evenly apply this stuff in my hair and work it through. Then, I twist my hair in those sections, let it dry, and when I take it out, BAM. Softer, shinier, smoother hair. Now, I have porous hair (dries out easily) and it's been hard to control it, but this product helps keep my dry hair moisturized when I use the method just described; ergo, this product is a pretty big deal in my life as of late.As for the smell, I actually hate it. I've had this oil for a few months now, so I've gotten used to the smell but I still think it smells unpleasant. If you're not a fan of coconut (which I'm not), you might not like this oil. It smells strong and bad (in my opinion), and that is because of the all natural ingredients packed in it so, eh, I continue to use it since I'm big on all-natural products.Oh, and I like to add this oil to my leave-in concoction spray consisting of this, castor oil and water. This mix definitely helps with my dry hair so I'll continue to mix it in my spray once I order some more. What I also like about this product is that a little goes a long way; I've had this stuff for months and I'm finally running out.Definitely give this product a try. Yes, everyone's hair is different but if you've never tried coconut oil or if you know your hair likes it, why not? Product quality: Great product.How I use: I use this oil as a hair and scalp conditioner (not the one you rinse out) I like to apply it to freshly washed wet hair and scalp after final rinse then massage it in. Sometimes i even let water run over it to get rid of any access oil ( can get greasy) then proceed with my moisture (leave in + sealant).  I get the most out the products this way.Tip: if you have Afro textured hair that’s in need of moisture I wouldn’t recommend you use this as a sealant bc it’s too light. I have natural hair (low porosity) it needs something thicker like hair grease or melted Shea butter to effectively seal all the moisture in.Cons: the smell is not the best i don’t have a sensitive nose being Black you build a high tolerance for scented hair products. But this one smells like old coconut (right b4 it goes bad) & lemon and the smell lingers 😩. I might have to use less or add essential oils.It can be greasy so don’t use a lot. I few drops per sections is all you needTakes consistent use to see results as far as growth goes (the bottle says 4 weeks). I’ve used this oil off and on bc i could never figure out the best way to use it. But I’ve figured it out after years lol.Take away: overall i give it a 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a good product. can you find others that does the same thing with similar ingredients? Yes. But i like the quality of this oil and the fact that it solidifies tells me that it’s unrefined coconut oil . I was drawn to it bc of the bottle design 🥥🌴👍🏾✨Update: 3/1/22Forget what i said abt the smell i think i probably got an old batch. The new formula pictured here has a fresh scent. I use it the same way. it soothes the scalp when it itches I’ve been using my Ayurvedic oils more nowadays to help with my shedding since i keep protective styles in for 3 weeks at a time. Don’t forget to massage that scalp 💆🏾‍♀️ I am currently transitioning to natural so I am constantly dealing with the dryness and different textures. I have found other products that takes care of those issues but they are a bit expensive so I wanted something to use as a backup. I tried this product first let me say the delivery was on point. I recieved my bottle of oil faster than I expected to. I applied it to my hair and at first I did not notice a difference but as I began to brush and smooth my hair it definitely made it softer. It's not too oily and does not leave your hair with that greasy feeling so thats a plus. However, I give it 4 stars because it did not soften my ends as much as I thought it would. I have used other coconut oils and it soften my ends. I had to constantly brush and add oil to smooth it out. But this is a great product to use when you are in between products or if you just want to moisten your hair really quick before bed. I have not tried it as a hot oil treatment yet, but I plan to soon. It has great ingredients, Alma, Henna, Lemon, Coconut oil and it smells amazing together by the way, so I am sure it will definitely work better on my ends once it is heated. A MIRACLE!!! From the very first time I used this I felt like it was a miracle. I finished my 8th application  yesterday and my hair is at least 1/3% more hair than when I started. It feels thick and soft..... I am telling ALL my friends. Women going thru hormonal changes will be very pleased with this product.  A MIRACLE!!They have many products including for skin and hair.... Had to mix it with other products because the smell is terrible",1,4,-3

Got these for my daughters thick hair, and they are ok, but don't really stay closed with a lot of hair. They also don't slide though the hair easily. I know this is because of the ""no slip"" but what's the point if you can't even get them in your hair? I ordered these clips as I needed something to hold loose hair that fell from my ponytail.  I was pleasantly surprised at the large size.  The different colors don't bother me as I use them mostly around the house, but if you want two that match, you need to get two sets.  But at this price, that is not really a problem.  They hold a good amount of hair and stay in well.  I am very pleased as they perform better than I expected.  I will definitely purchase these again so I have the matching sets. I have thin straight hair on top of my head.  These are something different but don't seem to stay as tight to my head as other Scunci grip clips do.  I like them and wear them but they aren't my favorite. Bought this to hold my hair up in the summer.  It really does the trick.  Highly recommend if you've got finer hair. These are great and so easy to put on, even with my physical limits. I have a full head if hair. They hold well even small amounts when styling. I bought 2 packs in order to have 3 matching pairs! I've tried most kinds of hair clips - barrettes, pins, combs - and these snap-in, snap-out are the ones that pull out least hair.  This size is very sturdy, and I wish I could find longer clips that last as long. Some of the clips bent up the first or second time I used them, making them unusable.  Low quality.  Also, why do I have to buy a group of clips of differing colors when I only want the light one??  I have to buy 3-4 sets to obtain 4 clips in the light color, giving the other away to friends.",4,4,0

Color Gel, 4d Golden Chestnut, 4 Oz (095216)","This hair dye was by far the #1 hair dye that I would use for natural color. I have eczema and was worried if this would cause irritation, but it didn't like my other hair dyes did. This does not have the toxic ammonia smell like normal hair dyes do. It also does NOT stain your scalp! Its gel consistency works nicely and does not drop too much, and because of the aloe Vera in the dye I experienced a pleasant cooling effect on my scalp. It may dry out your hair just a bit in the setting process, but it is not so drastically disappointing. I purchased the ""Golden Chestnut"" color for my partially bleached dark brown hair. The color was a bit darker than expected, but other than that it was great! I look forward to purchasing Herbatint again, and hopefully get the right color that I wanted! I have been using Herbatint for over 10 years. Great product doesn't cause irritation or allergy. While it takes a long time to dye my hair with this product, the results are great.  You don't have to mix all of the coloring which is a great money saver.  With shoulder length hair I can get two coloring from one box.  It does not have the harsh chemicals that other hair products have. I used to buy the most popular brands at retail stores and drug stores and they made my hair freeze and unmanageable.This brand will not dry or make my hair dry after I use it. I've been using this hair color for years. I like it a lot because it works really well without that ammonia smell. It seems much more gentle to my hair and scalp than other hair dyes but covers gray just as well as anything else I've used. Herbatint products contain a lot less toxic ingredients and work well for me....give it a try! My wife prefers this product among others because she says this tint is good to her body! Her hair gets a nice color and  the ingredients of Herbatint are smooth with the skin! Fast shipping great item than you",2,4,-2

This is a good size for bleaching your wig knots!! Definitely bleached like 4-5 different wigs knots with this!! The bleach worked fine only if you have red highlights in your hair be careful it will pull the brassiness There's a very small amount of bleach for the price to me.

If you want a good silicone, mineral oil, petrolatum, ect free product, give this a chance, is amazing! Love, Love, Love this Jane Carter Solution Nutrient Replenishing Conditioner!  It gives my hair enough slip to detangle much more easily than other conditioners I've tried.  My hair is soft and moisturized after using this conditioner. I'm so glad I was able to find it here on Amazon. I love Jane Carter products. I also use the leave-in conditioner. I use this in conjunction with Urbanbella shampoo and Redken deep conditioner. I shampoo, deep condition for about 30 minutes, rinse, then condition with JC conditioner. This makes my hair so much softer, shinier, and less tangled. I am a Black woman with a variation of hair types ranging from loose S-curls to tight spiral curls, and my hair loves this conditioner. Whether I am straightening my hair or wearing it curly, my hair always turns out better after using this conditioner. Also, it is probably JC working in conjunction with the other products that I use, but without it (I've run out before and just decided to only use the Redken DC) my hair does not feel quite as shiny, soft, and moisturized. I like it for my hair and would use it over and over again. The whole Jane Carter collection is just wonderful! I mostly love it because of its natural ingredients, I am trying to live overall a more natural life style, and the products fits it perfectly!I am of mixed race, half black half white, and trying to grow out my hair without doing ""the big chop"" after years of using chemicals. Once I started using it in conjunction with other products in this collection , it seemed to bring out my natural curl more, which I have never scene before ( as long as I can remember my hair has always been heat treated to make it straight).I do wish it was a little cheaper but the quality is worth the price! I just received this in the mail today and it has a slight rancid smell. There is noexpiration date on the bottle so I have no clue how old the bottle is that I was sent. Also, I looked at the ingredients on a bottle that I've had for a couple years and noticed that the formulation had changed. The ""good stuff"" has been moved further down on the ingredients list (see attached photos). I'm not sure if I should go ahead and use it or not due to the slight rancid smell. I'd planned on doing my hair today so this is a big inconvenience. I absolutely loved the way the old formulation made my hair feel and hire ready it was to detangle my hair with. Hopefully the new formulation will yield the same results. I will update this post after I obtain a non-rancid bottle and finally use it. This is the only conditioner I would ever use! I have big thick natural hair and the Jane Carter line is a great fit for my hair.",2,5,-3

It’s not too tar smelly after use. Hair gets pretty dry with product so I might consider using conditioner after use. Best dandruff treatment without rx. Cleans hair nicely. Use it twice a week .you will see the difference Best price I can find on REAL DHS Tar Shampoo. I've bought the same shampoo from other sellers at or below this seller's price, and the shampoo was not as dense and appeared to be thinner than what I've gotten at stores and pharmacies when I could find it there. I aim to buy more from this seller. I have seb derm and my scalp is always flaky and itchy. I normally have to wash my hair weekly to get relief. This product really does the trick. I can go longer between washes and my scalp isn’t so itchy. This product does make your hair dry so I would recommend a moisturizing shampoo afterward and a good conditioner. Works OK but did not help my issues Smells like tar, obviously, so not an amazing scent but works perfectly for flakey scalp. Ok ssoooo I had low hopes for this shampoo and after the first use I fell in LOVE!!! The smell isn’t as bad as I read in some reviews and once you wash it out of the hair the scent left is a soft scent and smells like a clean scent. After first use I didn’t think I’d be a fan because it left my hair feeling a little rough while still wet BUT once my hair dried it was so soft and smooth. The dandruff was IMMEDIATELY GONE!!! I have horrible horrible dandruff on the back of my scalp near the neck and have tried every shampoo you could think of to get rid of it with no success. A friend of mine mentioned her mother uses this for psoriasis which causes horrible dandruff for her mother so gave it a shot! I have now been using a little over a month and wash my extra long and thick hair 2x a week as recommended on the bottle!! I will never go back to regular shampoo!!!The only thing negative I have to say is the price is a bit high for such a small bottle! I wish the price was more affordable or the bottle was bigger. However it is worth it after the results it gives me!!! Will be purchasing more very soon as I have a little less then half a bottle left!! I bought this for myself and my son. He has really bad dandruff and I always get build-up because of going a few days between washes. I have a lot of super thick hair and I blow-dry and use a flat-iron so I like to wait a few days before having to do all that again. But my scalp does not like to go more than a day without washing. First, the smell is AWFUL it smells like freshly laid blacktop. It does fade after your hair is dry but there is definitely still a smell. Second, I did notice way less build-up between washes and it seems like less flakes in my hair. I'm not sure if my son has used it yet because he is worried about the smell. Definitely worth a try though.",1,4,-3

waterbased consistency cannot say anything wrong product not wish though cheap guess got paid,"Alberto Vo5 Moisture Milk Conditioner, Strawberries and Cream, 15 Ounce","I ADMIT IT - I AM A NATURAL HAIR CARE PRODUCT JUNKIE!  I was trolling different blogs & sites and the VO5 Moisture Milk line was hyped as a great cheap condish to use as a co-wash so of course I had to try it - and you really can't beat it for less than $1!How I used it - much like the instructions for WEN, I separated my hair into 4 sections and soaked my hair under lukewarm water; poured about a quarter-size portion into my palm then massaged it onto my scalp using my fingertips.  I added a little more (about a dime size) to my ends then massaged my scalp for about 2 - 3 mins before twisting each section. I left the condish on under a warm towel for 10 minutes before beginning to detangle my hair. After detangling, I rinsed the condish out using cool water; my hair felt so soft and smelled slightly of strawberries.PROS- the smell - it's not an overpowering sweet smell and doesn't linger too long after rinsing out- the price-silk protein adds a boost of moisture to my color treated hair- no 'conesCONS- this isn't really a con but be aware of the fact that it is a thin condish because I ended up using a little more than 1/2 the bottle to co-wash & detangle during one wash, it didn't provide enough slip for me so next time I plan to either detangle using coconut oil before co-washing or adding coconut oil to the condish to prevent using so much and aiding in the detangling.I'd highly recommend giving it a try because although Amazon's price is great, I've seen it on the ground for as little as $.76!  If it helps those who ""hair type"" - I'm African-American with unrelaxed, multi-textured hair types 3C & 4A/B. I bought this conditioner because it wasn't very expensive and I love strawberries and cream. I used it for the first time yesterday, it smelled so good as I massaged it into my scalp. I washed my hair with Alberto V05 Kiwi Lime Clarifying shampoo first, which I was also using for the first time, (see my review). My very fine hair had been looking a bit lifeless. Helps keep my curly hair soft and relaxed in high humidity. Easy to use as a spritz-on. I'm an african American winky kinky coarse texture hair. I recently went natural (4a) and was looking for a cowash conditioner that was not too expensive and would really moisturize and help me achieve healthier hair. I bought this off amazon expecting to be dissapointed and having to try again as i had for many months. To begin with this conditioner is like 69-70 cents can you say DEALL!!!! Also, the conditioner is a lot. you definitely get your bang for your buck the conditioner comes in 16 oz!!! When I first opened it i was surprised by how great it smelled. It smelled like strawberries and cream life savers a favorite food of mine. This will definitely become a must for me when it comes to hair products. I typically wash my hair twice a week and this will be perfect. I highly recommend this go buy it NOW!! I use this as a co-wash once and week.  I have no idea why I bought it here because you can get it from any dollar store for what? A dollar!  Anyway, the actual product is awesome for co-washing.  I'd never actually use it as a leave in because it doesn't give enough moisture on my wash days.  I also use this with my pre poo treatments as well. I have very coarse relaxed hair and this works great for me.  Only thing I don't like, the price! Maybe it's just me but this conditioner seems oddly runny?  Not a big deal but a little weird.It is nice that it's free of sulfates and silicones and has a really enjoyable smell. I use this on my scalp but use other, deeper conditioning products, as well. This is a good product but not enough moisture for my hair on its own! As described This is the most inexpensive conditioner around, but guess what - for snarly, dye-damaged hair, it is absolutely the best.  More effective than any of the high-price spreads. Makes comb-out torture a thing of the past.  No more handfuls of hair being lost with every shampoo.  I use a lot, for best effect, but my hair is never left feeling tacky or oily.  And at this price, who cares how much is used?  Not the Amazon price, the 99 cent price in the supermarket. Take it from an Old Hippie who refuses to cut her hair - this is the way to go for silky, detangled tresses.",1,1,0

Not a big deal since I have short hair so I don't need much, and overall, the brand has given me good results, but if every single time I have to order, I am always waiting on a 2 week or more delay for the type I want, and the type I settle on comes open. I may have to reconsider just finding a new brand I can more easily get while I get groceries. Shampoo was all over the packaging very disappointed. The shampoo itself is awesome! I've been a customer of their brand for a couple of years now; it never disappoints. The only thing is that this product comes sealed in a plastic bag and when you take it out it feels very sticky and slimy. It's kinda gross but a quick wash of the bottle in a sink gets rid of this weird stickiness. Other than that, it's a great product. At first, I did not know whether the shampoo I purchased here at Amazon and the one I purchased at eBay was authentic.  So I bought another bottle of this shampoo from a local hair salon, and when I used it, the color of the shampoo was pure, thick white, just as the shampoo I bought here.  The hair salonist assured me that the Daily Moisturizing Shampoo should be pure, thick white; only the Daily Shampoo is a clear brown color.  I feel confident now about buying this shampoo at Amazon, and I am very satisfied with this product. This is his favorite and it is sad when I cannot get it. The smell is good, the moisturizing is good and it is not terribly expensive. He alternates between this and a tea tree shampoo that we both like and it works out. We have been using it for years on his hair. I’ve been using this for year for both my son and husbands hair. My son was a swimmer and with conditioner it kept his hair in good shape Not really worth the hype .Comes in small bottle and the scent is hardly noticable . It is gentle on your hair even when used daily",5,3,2

Have been using this wrapping lotion for years. I was going to order two smaller bottles, but after seeing this large bottle, I figured I’d use be wise and use the savings and purchase this instead. Like other reviewers, it arrived with leakage. I lost a few ounces, but not enough to purchase two separate 8oz bottles. Thank you for another great offer. My curly hair loves this still. I put ondripping wet. Set with humidifying resistance hairspray and end it’s dry - I give it a good shake all around and my hair done. SAS!  Simple This is my second time ordering this product I would have given it five stars but it was leaking and spilling out. I like the product it works very well easy to use and worth the price. I absolutely love Keracare wrap lotion. It allows me to get a nice straight wrap setting with all the tangles. I love this product, after reading what other customers wrote, I had to try it for myself. It leaves a long lasting shine and softness to the touch. I will definitely purchase this product again. Thanks!! I've been using this product for some time now and I love it so much I bought the large refill.  It smells great and eaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable with lasting results. I have used Keracare products for about 10 years but never tried the form wrap. Well it met all my expectations. My hair felt silky and controlled frizz. Also curls last longer. My daughter has been using this product for over to years, and it produces the most amazing curls. But note, the liquid should be clear and produce a thick foam.Ienjoybeauty and BoxBeauty both have provided a milky product that barely foamed and definitely did nothing for her hair.

It cleanses my fine hair, doesn't dry it out andit doesn't leave a heavy residue. This is an expensive shampoo. It has always been very thick getting it out of the bottle. It has been an excellent product. My last two purchases were a disappointment! The shampoo is now very watered down. So watered down that it no longer cleans well! My favorite shampoo! My hair needs a shampoo that’s helps with dryness and this one seems to help with that. The scent is clean & light. You only have to use a small amount This is not the real thing. I should have checked that link before purchasing. Now I have awful scented shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo was watered down with a brownish fluid and it scent was awfully perfumy. It is way past the return date, because anyone who uses the real thing knows you need very little to cleanse sufficiently and it's usually thick (both the conditioner and shampoo), so I ordered it a bit early so I would have them for when I ran out. This shampoo is nice and very rich. It's supposed to be sulfate free, though it lists Olefin Sulfonate, a surfactant, as the second ingredient. I'm no chemist, but it sounds like that may be similar to a sulfate, or possibly a derivative of one. It lathers, which I wasn't expecting; the other sulfate-free products I've used in the past do not lather at all. (Maybe this is what the Olefin Sulfonate does? As I said, I'm not a chemist.)This product is very concentrated. It truly only takes a tiny amount, which is nice because it's so expensive. I've found that if I thoroughly soak my hair for at least one full minute, even up to 90 seconds, before applying the product, it requires less to do the job. I currently have a very short bob cut, and I typically use a dime-sized dot of shampoo.I do believe that regular use of this shampoo lengthens the life of my hair color and shine. Best shampoo I've ever used! No build up. Hair is healthy, shiny, & full each time I use it. A little goes a long way. No phosphates. Have used this product for a few years.  Love it.",1,5,-4

This stuff makes my hair beautifully voluminous without being Texas pageant big and stiff (no offense to my Texas girls).

Oz. Tube","I am on record as saying that all tar shampoos -- I have used one for over 50 years for psoriasis -- work equally well. So, I usually focus on price and availability. For this one, I liked the fact that it comes in a tube with a top that you can stand it on. This reduces the problem of getting that last bit out of the bottle. Besides, I like the name, being a Grandpa myself.I found that it seems to work as well as any other tar shampoo, and I like the way it is packaged. It has more of a pine scent than other tar shampoos I have used. I like that. I read through some of the other reviews before I bought this product back in May, but I don't think there were as many as there are now.  I've also read where a lot of reviewers don't like the smell and claim that it does not work for them.  To each his own.  While the jury is still out on the fragrance of this shampoo, I'd put my results against anyone else who claims it didn't work.I've tried a lot of shampoos and for a long time I was a fan of products that contain coal tar solution.  I never had any luck with products where the active ingredient was selenium sulfide, pyrithione zinc or anything other than coal tar solution.  I've tried them all.  And then a few years ago the brands that I liked to use stopped using coal tar solution as the active ingredient and claimed a ""new improved formula"" - none of them worked for me.  I ran out of what I was using because I couldn't find anything with coal tar other than T-Gel.  And T-Gel worked in that it helped ""control"" my psoriasis and reduce plaques, but it never made my scalp healthy and its fragrance was nothing to brag about either.  So I starting using a left over bottle of baby shampoo just to wash my hair until I could find something that worked.  It was by accident using the baby shampoo that I realized my skin was sensitive to the surfactants used in mainstream brands.  This is one of the reasons that baby shampoo is tear free - it has less harsh ingredients.  My symptoms were reduced, but it still didn't get rid of the flaking and plaques I had on my scalp.  I was further convinced that using a different shampoo formula was part of my problem when I stayed at a hotel and used the complimentary shampoo.  Whatever cheap, harsh chemicals were in hotel shampoo caused my scalp to get worse in just one or two days of use.I found a shampoo at a natural foods retailer that was free of the harsh chemicals.  I like the smell of it and it was supposed to assist with scalp health, but it still didn't eliminate the plaques.  I then tried Grandpa's bar soap because this retails stopped carrying the shampoo. The bar soap helped, but it had a strong, funky smell.  I put the bar inside a travel soap holder because it was so fragrant.  I finally ordered Grandpa's shampoo from Amazon in May and have used it daily since.  My scalp has never been healthier.  I have no sores, no plaques, and no flakes.  It is, by far, the best shampoo I've ever used to control my psoriasis.  It does have a funky smell, and my wife is not fond of it, but I don't think the smell is as strong as Grandpa's bar soap.  I am almost out of this first bottle, so I'm going to order it again with my next Amazon order and will order two bottles so that I'll always have a backup. I have only written one other review on Amazon since I started using the website in 2002. I'm not big on reviews and rarely read them, I go with my gut or brands I trust. I heard about this product from a friend who experienced the same issues as I did and it worked. Everyone's biology is different and some things work for some while it doesn't for others. I'm not endorsing this product, nor being paid to write a review. I simply want to share how well it worked.Every Fall and Spring when the seasons change, I get terrible scalp itching and flakes; like seasonal dandruff. It only lasts around 6 weeks and then my body seems to adjust and it goes away. I've tried every other store brand on the market, including the high end choices. They have never worked for me. I bought this when it first started this year and within 1 day the itching stopped. Within 3 days, all flaking went away. I bought the Conditioner as well that goes with it and my hair feels amazing.And frankly, I'm an outdoor person to begin with, I love the woodsy, outdoor, sitting by a fire kind of scent my hair has now. When I was a child I had an illness that caused my hair to start falling out. The doctor told my mom to start washing my hair in pine tar shampoo. I don’t know if it was the treatment, the shampoo or a combination but my hair started coming back. It came in thick and beautiful. It has been years since I used it. A few years ago I went on a shampoo hunt. I was trying all kinds from a couple of dollars to shampoos that cost me $25 a bottle. I didn’t find any I was truly impressed with. Then I saw this on Amazon and decided to try it. I love it. My hair is so soft, clean and beautiful. My friends have commented about how long it is getting. It’s past my waist for the first time since my twenties. I’m not saying it does anything special. Any number of things could contribute to the condition and growth of my hair, principally nutrition. I can’t deny though that my hair looks, feels and smells great after using Grandpa’s Pine Tar Shampoo. For anyone who doesn’t like the smell, I haven’t noticed that my hair smells bad. I asked others to smell it and they said it just smells fresh. My advice is to buy a bottle, try it for a few shampoos and see if you note a difference. It’s the only to know if something will works for you. Liked no SLS. This helped clear a scalp condition  caused by allergy to SLS. I thought the price was high, but tried it and was pleased.  It really helped with itchy scalp in the summer (irritation due, probably, to wearing a cap a lot).  Due to its consistency, which was about that of molasses, a little went a long way.  However, the second tube is the consistency of dishwashing detergent, and tends to pour out of the tube instead of being squeezable.  I'll order a third tube, but unless it's back to the thick formula, it'll be my last one. Smells strongly of pine and campfire but I love that. The scent disappates after a while. Makes my hair so soft and helps with my psoriasis. Hard to find these so I was excited to find them on Amazon. Also love the pine tar shampoo and the bar soap. A friend recommended this for our dog that was suffering from chronic itching due to allergies. The smell is very medicinal but he does have a nice shiney coat and between allergy rx from vet and I believe this shampoo he seems to be cured :) A bit expensive, but if makes my puppy comfortable it's worth it!!",4,4,0

decided to switch after years of using henna. I figured I would use a paintbrush and dye my grey roots, while leaving the length orange and brown. The bottle came well sealed but the label was covering the instructions. I used a brand new paintbrush and just dipped it in, applying liberally.No stranger to messy dye, I used gloves and kept my work area tidy. Even so, when I rinsed the paintbrushes off, any tiny bit of contact with the countertop resulted in permanent stains, even when I tried to wipe it away immediately. Tried borax and super washing soda combined with lemon juice. No luck. Tried scrubbing bubbles. Nada. Tried hydrogen peroxide. Also no. Manufacturer's web site has some recommendations such as Magic Eraser and/or acetone but we have neither of those. Before you start, test your workspace in a non-visible area and make sure you have a good cleaning solution for it before you start.Even so, I was very tidy. I even managed to keep the dye off of my scalp in most spots, except towards my temples where the hair is very fine. I have very thick hair and figured I'd test a top layer before bothering with lower layers. But I also did apply it fairly thickly on top. It looked great during application. I let it sit for four hours (after running strand tests and finding the white hair to be fairly stubborn if less than 4 hours). When I rinsed the initial dye out, this is what it looked like right away, while still wet. Basically, pink scalp with still white strands.To be fair, I didn't bleach it. I have knee-length hair and am not about to risk that kind of damage. Henna is far more effective and doesn't need to be bleached. You can see some orange henna strands toward the back from months ago. I usually use a tiny amount of acid with henna, such as vinegar or lemon juice, to help the dye absorb. I may try a mix of that on a strand test to see if there's a ratio that wouldn't cause harm.I don't want to give up on Manic Panic but it's ineffective so far and damaging to bathroom surfaces. That said, it smells neutral, which is a lot better than henna. It's also nice that it's premixed and not as much of a royal mess, though at least henna doesn't permanently stain countertops/tubs.I had been hoping to go for buying purple, red, and blue to give a subtle flame-like hue on my grey roots, over the course of a couple of years. But this just isn't really working out so far. I'll probably keep trying and will update the review if I have any success.Update (about a week later):I did another round and am going to increase the star rating. This time, the dye absorbed really well! I did two things differently: I shampooed my roots a day ahead of time and I used about twice as much dye. I also used petroleum jelly on my scalp line, as others recommended. That helped for not having a pink face but I found it didn't really work on the top of my head, as it just meant that the roots became immune to dye, lol. Basically, for my hair, if it's too conditioned/coated, the dye won't absorb. If it's dry, it bonds better. I have almost ankle-length hair, so I usually keep my hair pretty oiled and conditioned to avoid snarls. I do not bleach, ever, as that runs too much risk of breakage/harm.I do love how conditioned my hair feels after using this dye. I've upgraded from 2 stars to 5 stars. I'd probably knock it a half star for the way it dyes the countertop and tub, if I could take away half a star. I'm not sure how well it will hold up with time and may update the review later. I will note that the dye didn't stain the tub if it was diluted, such as during showering, but I also only used this on my roots (I use henna on the length) so volume may be part of why it went okay. My fingernails got badly stained - even though I used gloves, this stuff is strangely itchy for me so scratching it the first day led to messy pink fingernails. Not a big deal though. I ended up buying another color too, as the second round went so much better than the first round. Shipping time was great for this product. I usually use Pinky Colors, but they couldn't ship next day. So I went with this Maniac Panic Hot Hot Pink that could ship next day and I like it a lot. Manic Panic Vampire Red Color Cream 2 Pack Classic High Voltage:I used this product for a mermaid costume (I hate wigs), and I am super happy with the results. Honestly, if work would allow me to keep this color I absolutely would. HOWEVER I super did not expect it to show up as vividly as it did on my light-medium brown hair. (Picture attached)My hair was color treated (apprx 2 months ago) with a dark natural red-ish/brown color & highlights. I expected the highlights to be bright, but this stuff showed up allover. I did not pretreat my hair in any way. Washed well with normal dove shampoo the night before (apprx 24 hrs) & did not condition.The person helping me had never used hair-dye before. That’s how simple this stuff is. I used vaseline around my hairline & on my ears to keep from dying my skin which was a good call. We poured 1 tub of the dye into a bowl & they used their hand (with a glove) to apply it all over my hair. It took quite some time to apply (maybe 45 min) due to users having no clue what we were doing, and I left it on for around 45 minutes after finishing.The consistency is great so there wasn’t any unwanted dye mess in the bathroom. I cut open a trash bag & used it around my shoulders to try to reduce mess as well. Recommend one for the floor & other surfaces just in case. I have VERY long hair, and one tub was enough. I’m glad I got the two-pack just incase, but I only needed one.I rinsed with cold water & sulfate free shampoo/conditioner. The water never “ran clear” despite rinsing for a long time so I eventually gave up. I let it air dry & slept with it in a top-knot to finish drying. I slept on a towel which was a good idea. First red picture is after taking it down the next day. No heat. No styling. No products. The color is stunning & I’m obsessed. Again though: it is WAY brighter than everything I read (reviews included) made me think it would be.I washed it last night & was honestly trying to get a good bit of the color out - to no avail. I shampooed twice/conditioned once with sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner & used hot water. After about 30 minutes in the shower the water finally seemed to run *mostly* clear, but it was not as clear as I prefer. I shower at night before bed & only towel dry so it is still pretty damp when I lie down. Again slept on a towel & this was just as important ad after it was first dyed. TONS of transfer overnight. Last picture is today after it has finally air-dryed completely. My hair still feels soft & healthy after dying. I notice all my baby hairs going wild a ton more, but that is always the case after dye.My only complaint about the product is the color transfer after washing when wet. I can’t really speak to when it is dry, but I don’t believe I had issues with it being down against my white shirt when it was dry (but I imagine rain/sweat would be a problem). I almost never blow-dry my hair so if I were able to keep this color long-term the transfer would be an issue for me.Will update as necessary. I am trying to get the color out asap & will wash with regular shampoo/conditioner & hot water plus whatever else I can think of. Sorry, employers. Not thrilled about having to wash daily until it fades & honestly a little worried the faded colors will be more offensive to the employers than the dark red.Fyi: The review asks me to rate “drying power,” and I honestly have no clue what that is. So I’m 5 starring that one for benefit of doubt. When my kids want color these manic panic colors a the best and easy to touch up!",1,2,-1

Also makes for a good leave in conditioner, i use about 1/3 the amount i normally use, massage it into my hair and than squeeze excess water out and it leaves hair soft and manageable too.update: lowered stars to 3 from 5. don't know if they changed formula or i received an old bottle or i received a knockoff but, finally ran out of previous bottle bought elsewhere and got around to using this new bottle and it does NOT perform like previous bottles bought elsewhere! the consistency is thicker, the lovely smell i love is barely noticeable, there is no slight tingling on my scalp with this one, and it conditions horribly, i went from using a chocolate kiss size amount to having to use literally about 2 ounces just to get it through my hair to condition it some. good thing i didn't buy my first bottle here for i would of never bought it again! going back to buying it from where i use to that's for sure.update: repurchased a bottle but, from Amazon themselves this time and it is like before and smells great so i guess the previous bottle from another seller was indeed not right/or bad.. upped rating up to 4 stars. This product is super easy to use, smells good and washes clean. No more tangles and long hair looks luxurious. Not bad but I’m allergic to fragrance in products and the ingredients listed online does mention fragrance but it does on the bottle. I’m guessing the ingredients changed The conditioner is pretty good, does not smell great. The container is so slim, it makes it hard to get the product out into your hand. This product does smell like mint. It didn't do a great job of conditioning my hair. I was hoping for soft shiny hair but did not get that result at all. The bottle is very hard to squeeze for no reason at all. Why make the bottle so hard to squeeze out product? Giovanni  Tea Tree Triple Treat Invigorating Conditioner is a premium product leaving your hair to blow in the wind. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this conditioner. I will never be able to use another conditioner, and I have used a lot of conditioners before (including those super expensive ones).Here are some reasons why I fell in love with this conditioner:1) the scent. It is not overpowering or perfum-like. It's a gentle, natural scent. It's almost refreshing!2) I have some seriously long hair, all the way down my back, and I only have to use 1 pump and comb it through my hair in over to cover my whole head. Such a nice change from the huge handful I used to have to use with other conditioners.3) I always let my conditioner sit in my hair for 2-5 minutes while I wash my face and body, and when I rinsed this out the first time I kept rinsing and rinsing because I almost thought that I still had conditioner in my hair because it felt so soft! My hair has never felt as soft as when I started using this conditioner.4) it doesn't weigh my hair down at all, which is important because I have lots and lots of semi-fine, oily hair.You know that feeling that your hair has right after you leave the salon? When you walk out and feel like your in one of those shampoo commercials because your hair is so soft, shiny, and bouncy? That's what this conditioner did for my hair!!I've been using this conditioner (along with the tea tree triple treat shampoo) for about 3-4 months now and I'm still as in love with it as I was the first day that I used it. I have tried numerous conditioners for life in the tropics, Pacific Northwest, and high altitude deserts.  The one that has worked in them all, which doesn't leave my head a horrible itchy mess (Especially in very dry climates) is this amazing stuff.  My hair has thinned over the years and it's almost impossible not to get conditioner on my scalp, which always results in a dry, burning itch of a head.My daughter also tried it; her hair is extremely thick, naturally curly, and always dry and brittle due to the straight iron she uses.  She's tried many conditioners as well.  After one of her visits my conditioner mysteriously disappeared, so I asked her where it may have gone.  We had to laugh about having found a conditioner that worked so well she nipped it. - This stuff is amazing!Because my hair is this thin now I do add a few drops of essential tea tree to it and give it a good shake.  It works without it, but since I do get it on my scalp this really helps my head feel normal after washing.I have found it at various online health stores (none locally), but Amazon has the best price, and with free 2 day shipping, I can't find a better price elsewhere.",5,5,0

Smells good also no comment In one of my travels to Costa Rica I went to a salon, after the haircut the stylist used this spray on my hair.  My hair looked so beautiful, it was like magical!  So, I decided to buy one and use it on my house, and voilá... it worked. It is such a good product!  Every time I use it my hair looks shiny and it is very soft. I highly recommend it. This spray doesn't leave your hair greasy, but it leaves your hair looking healthier and moisturized.En uno de mis viajes a Costa Rica, fui a un salón a cortarme el cabello. Al final, la estilista usó este spray en mi cabello, y lo panchó, y fue como si hubiera hecho magia, mi cabello me quedó tan brillante y suave, que decidí comprarme una botella. No me arrepiento. Lo uso todos los días. Mi cabello es fino y tiende a ser grasoso, pero este spray no deja mi cabello grasoso ni me quita cuerpo.  Se lo recomiendo a cualquier persona que sufra con el frizz... santo remedio. A great product at a great value. I have hair to my mid back and don't like to weigh it down with heavy conditioners every time I wash it.  Years ago I came across Moisture Kick when my then-hairdresser (Michael Boychuk) recommended it for detangling.  My hair gets so tangled when I wash it and don't deep condition so I gave it a try, even though I had visions of the No More Tears spray of childhood, which neither detangled nor prevented tears.  I just love it for detangling, I spray it all over my hair (don't drench it, just even spray), wait about 60 seconds and my hair combs right out.  It doesn't weigh my hair down at all, just calms it so it doesn't frizz.  That said, I don't necessarily agree with others here who feel it has great conditioning benefits.  For me, it's just helps detangle, but I don't notice that otherwise my hair is really ""conditioned"" in any meaningful way.  Anyway, I can't live without it for the reasons I said, and if others are getting more out of it than I do, well, that's all good! I have been using this product religiously for about 13 years and it’s the only thing that can take completely damaged hair and make it beautiful. Very light weight and not greasy like most leave ins I usually pair this with it’s a 10 as that has a heat protectant and that’s really the only reason as I’ve used this alone or the past for a good chunk of my life and I can say with all certainty it’s why my hair is so healthy and grows so well as I have fine hair that I use to love to experiment on. Also the smell is a clean smell. Isn’t  overpowering. One of the best on the market! I hope it never goes away! If you have the colored hair the pink bottle is the same formula just helps hold in color! I never let any hairdresser, or anyone for that matter, put any products in my hair. I find they make my hair very greasy, and I do not like the feeling, or even smell. However, finally, a hairdresser turned me on to Moisture kick, over my complaining not to put any product in my hair.Well, I was in love! That must have been almost 10 years ago, and I have been using it ever since, and turning all sorts of people on to this product.The product really is light, with a wonderful smell. It works amazingly, considering how light it is. You cannot feel it in your hair, but you will feel the results. My hair becomes much more manageable, and all the frizzes disappear! It also becomes so much softer and shinier. Buen producto!",5,5,0

Ever since I first started using this product about 2 years ago, it's been my favorite.  I always love trying new products but I consistently come back to this one.  The Sweet Almond fragrance is just intoxicating. Smells absolutely lovely.  This product leaves my hair feeling silky smooth and also full bodied.  I have sholder length, very fine & thin hair.  So for me to say that a product leaves my hair full bodied - well, that's a big accomplishment!  I have also tried the lavender one and I love that one just as much.  I guess it's just a matter of fragrance preference and I assume that all of WEN styling cremes accomplish the same thing.  But you must be careful to not put too much on and make sure you distribute it evenly or your hair will look oily & weighed down.  I put one single pump on my entire head.  I emulsify the creme in my palms well before spreading it through my hair.  The only downside to this creme is the price.  Compared to drugstore brands, it's super expensive but I guess it's comparable to other fine quality styling products.  Six ounces may not sound like a lot, but it really does last a long time.  I am going to definitely going to continue to buy this again & again. I bought this in hope, but it's not for me. I have thick and coarse hair. Also, my hair is long, wavy, and voluminous. I have a lot of hair!!! I watched on youtube the instructional video on how to do the whole process, and I did everything, but it only left my hair as the same thing as it was. Maybe it didn't work well because I bought the sweet almond mint , and about the conditioner it's writen ""a universal cleasing conditioner beneficial for all hair types. Works exceptionally well on fine to medium hair"" Then, the styling creme is for the same kind of hair as the conditioner!!!!!!!Also, I saw the wen instructional dvd styling creme video on youtube, but Chaz Dean said that Wen conditioner adds ""body"" to your hair. Well, that's not my case!I do NOT need more ""body"". There are more types of conditioners/styling cremes that work differently acording to your hair type, so BE CAREFUL!(sweet almond mint, tea tree, cucumber aloe, lavander, fig)-  the last one it says ""wonderful for medium to coarse, wavy to curly, and ethic hair. works exceptionally on dry,dehydrated,color-treated, damaged hair"". Maybe, the FIG condioner and creme would have been better for me...The styling creme is OK, but it didn't show any amazing results to spend so much money. My previous creme does the same thing  and it's cheaper. Maybe, one day I can buy the FIG and see. I have been using the Wen products for the last 2 months and I am so happy with the results. I was skeptical at first, but my Mom had the products and gave them to me to try out. I gave it a shot since I was so frustrated with all the products cluttering my cabinets that just didn't work.My hair is thick,curly,frizzy,porous and dry. I would always use a ton of condition and still have a hard time combing my hair out after a shower.  I was really surprised when I first tried the products because I noticed that my hair felt softer and smoother right out of the shower. I let my hair air dry and while it was still damp, I applied the Styling Creme.  As it got dryer, I would apply more to the areas I felt needed some taming.I really like the styling creme because I can keep applying it to my hair without ever feeling like I have too much product in my hair. My hair feels soft and my curls look more defined. My only wish was that it came in larger quantities.  I use alot of it since my hair just sucks it right up. See above comment. Good for the hair I have been a loyal user of Wen for going on three years now. I first found out about the products from QVC, and have been using them ever since. Like other buyers I have shopped price when it came to the Wen products, not realizing at the time that there was a difference between his products, and the infomercial products. Luckily Chaz does have a legitimate storefront here on Amazon, and this is one of the few real deal products. I always use this after I get out of the shower and have towel dried my hair, as I never blow dry. It helps keep my hair so soft and easy to care for. While this product is the real deal, be wary of other products, as the internet is full of the Gunthy-Renker infomercial crap. Shop quality and not price, and you will be amazed to see the difference in your hair. I am a WEN girl for life and will never go back! I started using Wen a few weeks ago and purchased the Fig cleansing conditioner. Its great but my dry tortured hair needed more help with moisture even using the product as a leave in. So I purchased the styling cream. The scent is heavenly, powerful in the bottle but not on your hair once its dry. The styling cream gave me not only the added moisture that I needed, but shiny, soft hair with just the right amount of hold. I havent been able to use any kind of hairspray in years as they all seem to irritate my scalp. Living in Florida with the heat and humidity I am prone to frizz and fly aways.I love Wen cleansing conditioner, it realy has transformed my hair and I can't imagine ever going back to regular shampoo/conditioner..EVER! But I am tempted to try a different cleansing conditioner product next time only because of the cost of Wen (if that one doesnt work I'll come back to Wen definitely and the cost is worth it), however the styling cream I will stick with no matter what.",1,5,-4

Henna can be really messy and I was hoping this set would help that. I've been using henna for almost a year. I've gotten pretty good at it but I do look for products that may help with the process.I got what is pictured but feel that it's not for me.  The bowl part is the only thing that is just okay to me but even that is small. I didn't like how hard the plastic is to the touch (the bowl is fine) but everything else feels cheap. The corners of the plastic are rough and sharp. The two applying brushes are big and really hard. They remind me of what salons use but not this hard. At least as far as I know. Maybe they are? I used it few times and don't like it. The brush part is so hard! They don't really pick up product unless you scoop them into the product is the only I can get anything on brush. I tried to use the clips but they don't stay in my hair, they are very long. I do have really fine thin hair so maybe that's why. Ordering something like this sounded like a good idea but I'll stick with my kitchen bowl and kids plastic spoons. I'm giving 4 stars because I got what was pictured. This set may be great for someone else but it's not for me. My hair went gray very young, I have a hard time covering it, it is very stubborn. It is too expensive to get it done at a salon all the time. So I touch up roots every three weeks or so, and read that using a brush makes the color saturate, especially on stubborn grays. Apparently, the friction of the brush makes the color adhere better than when applying by a nozzle alone.This has been a useful kit so far, although I am not sure why there are only three clips instead of four to separate the hair into quadrants.  The gloves are sturdier than what comes in a hair coloring box. The brush bristles are stiff, it was hard to work in the color, but that might be my inexperience.  The smaller bristle/comb combo covered my temples nicely.  I did however feel that I got better gray coverage than I do normally with these brushes. I only used the giant comb to separate hair into the one-inch sections from applying the dye, but it might be useful for combing down the color if your coloring instructions indicate doing so.Everything fits into the little zippered plastic bag, so it is easy to store and throw a few extra clips and items in there for easy access. Super helpful if you color your hair at home. I've found that whenever I color my hair at home, the roots don't always seem to ""take"" the color.  I decided to try this kit, mostly for the brushes, to brush the color in, like a colorist would.I like that there are 3 different brush sizes - I found each one helpful. The ends of the brushes have that point, which makes sectioning the hair easy as well.I was concerned that the bristles were very stiff, but once I started using the brushes with the color, I found this was not an issue at all.  The brushes were easy to use and worked well with the color.The clips included in this kit were also very helpful!  I also really liked that this came with a zippered pouch to keep everything together in one place.If you're trying to get salon-type results, this, along with some great color, are definite must-haves. So ever since I found all the reasons we shouldn't dye our hair without a professional, I decided to take a more careful approach to my root touch ups.  I either buy a natural dye or a box dye.  I mix it in the bowl in this kit and apply only to my roots so as not to dry out the ends of my hair.This kit comes with a wide toothed comb, gloves (which are kind of a one hit wonder), three clips for sectioning hair, a mixing bowl, and several brushes for direct application.  It works just fine.  It makes the task of saving my hair easy.  Everything washes up really easy.The gloves are really only good for one use.  But gloves are cheap if you buy them in a lot of 20 or so, and most other dyes come with gloves.  Everything fits in the little plastic bag for storage. This hair dye tool kit is very handy to have around, especially if you use crazy colors like Manic Panic or Raw dyes. The brushes are useful for applying the dye to hair without too much dripping and the plastic cup is great for holding/mixing the dye before applying. The cup also has a rubbery ring around the bottom to make sure it doesn't slide around when you're using both hands to apply the dye. The comb is useful as well but I didn't really use it enough to write much about it. The clips however, are very useful if you need to clip some hair up out of the way or keep a plastic bag over your hair an extended amount of time. Clean up is easy since it's all made of black plastic, just rinse with hot water and towel dry before storing everything in the nifty clear storage zipper pouch.I definitely recommend this to anyone who dyes their hair at home a lot, it really is very useful. My order did arrive a day late. But that's okay, I don't blame the seller, I blame USPS.This was a good purchase. Everything displayed in the picture came in the kit. The bowl is a very good size, as a few others have said. The clips are strong enough, even for my thick hair. Though, they are much bigger than I thought they were, but that's okay.My only ""complaint"" with this product is it is made a little cheap. Especially the wide tooth comb. It's a little rubbery, so the bristles were slightly bent when I received the package. And the white ends on the bristles are flaking off. But that hasn't stopped me from using it. Works great on my hair. The dye brush bristles are also a little bent because of the way they were packed in the case. But other than that, everything's good.Bottom line, I recommend this product. I needed a kit to dye my hair at home and this had everything I needed! It’s so easy to use, I love that it comes with a little pouch so when you’re done you can just put everything back and not have everything loose around the house. It comes with different dye brushes, big hair clips, and a hair comb as well. It’s great for the value. Made my dying hair at home experience so easy!",5,3,2

best curly hair maintain curl,"Kinky Curly Spiral Spritz, 8 oz","I have fine 3A hair. For the longest time I would’ve just told you my hair was wavy, because I didn’t realize the work needed to make my hair curl—and keep it that way. I’ve found good light gel keeps it from weighing itself down while it’s drying.Kinky-Curly curling custard (the one in the tub; not this product) has been a miracle-worker on my hair. It holds my hair strong while wet, then dries soft. However, it does have a bit of a medicinal scent, and until it’s dry my hair looks and feels a bit like shellac. My restless soul is always pulled toward the allure of a slightly lighter, more perfect gel.So this is the second time I’ve cheated on the curling custard with the spiral spritz. And both times have had me running back to curling custard, begging for forgiveness.This is a decent gel that works best as a second line of defense. It’s great for second- and third-day refreshes. Because it’s too thick to spray directly on hair (seriously, I don’t understand why they haven’t put a regular push-cap on it yet) I’ve experimented with both spraying it into my hands and diluting it in a water bottle so can spray in a mist. I go back and forth between which I prefer—they’re both fine.But as a primary gel on wash days, I have to apply a lot of product to get the hold I need to see my curls through drying. So I go through a bottle probably three times faster than a tub of curling custard. Even so, it’s still not quite strong enough to get the job done.So I’m halfway through this bottle and am transitioning it back into a refresher gel. I’m going to buy a new tub of curling custard to be my main squeeze. The Kinky-Curly marketing team has work to do. This is actually a great product if used properly, but those who could benefit from it would never know due to the improper description and naming. I would have given it five stars, if not for that.I have african-american hair and a combination of curl patterns...tight curls at the very top of my head, and lose, smoother curls around the crown. I purchased this spiral spritz looking for something quick to revive my second-day hair...something that is a light mist, with the hold that the Carol's Daughter leave-in conditioner mist I've been using doesn't provide.First of all, this is not a spritz AT ALL...it does not mist or spray, it STREAMS. If you're not sure what I mean, find a bottle of household cleaner and turn the nozzle to stream...that's what you get. A big glob of gook shot straight into in your hair, and because it's a gel texture, it's difficult to spread around once that happens. I was dumbfounded by the fact that they describe it so incorrectly... I actually stood in the bathroom staring at the bottle for a few seconds after my first pump, totally befuddled.The only thing the pump feature is good for, is conserving product... I know that it takes five pumps to manipulate each section of my hair. It is convenient in that regard, but still, I use this product daily and it has lasted me only about a month. It is definitely pricey, and you really need to love it to continue paying so much for so little (which I do)...which again is why they need to market it correctly.This is not a light mist that will revive your second day curls, but it can add days between washes and deep conditioning if used in a different way. Personally, I've never ""revived"" my curls by spraying anything on them on the days following a wash/deep condition/styling to a standard that I can confidently do anything other than a quick trip to the store or something of that nature...hence my search for a new product. I've found that, because this spiral spritz is basically a diluted version of the Kinky-Curly Curling Custard, I can loosen my curls with water and leave-in conditioner, then use this spritz to style the ares of my hair where the curls are loser. I then use another gel for the areas with tighter curls, and in about five minutes I can have AWESOME second, third, fourth, etc day curls. Because I don't use a heavy gel, like the Curling Custard (in which case I would end up with sticky clumps), I can completely saturate my hair and get the curls really defined, and it air dries very quickly.Overall, the product defines curls without making them sticky, and leaves them light and bouncy. It has little shrinkage, and dries quickly. The downfall is the price and the fact that the description and name sets the wrong expectation. Wish this stuff was a little cheaper but I do love it. Perfect for scrunching. Liked the moisture &shine fragrance my only complaint, since the bottle is transparent with yellow print I could not read instructions. My daughter has type 2C curly hair. I keep it short for easier maintenance, and use 1 part Kinky curly mixed with 1 part water (half the kinky curly is poured into a separate spray bottle). This completely resolves the ""crunchy"" issue that the full concentrate will create, while also allowing me to stretch the product. Essentially I am paying for two bottles for the price of one.Given that the diluted Kinky curly is perfect for her hair, I do not plan on switching to anything else.It may help if other reviewers posted their hair type. I do not see how kinky curly would work well on very coiled hair, for example. And I also don't think it works well without being diluted. At least not for my daughter. It made her hair super crunchy.So one star taken off for having to dilute this product, but after that, it is fantastic! This product came like this. Look used. I have 2a/b waves, and very thin fine hair but a LOT of it.  My hair loves to go stringy on me and halo frizz rules the day in most cases.  However, I have found that this product (after trying 100 others, it seems) has done the best job so far in taming the frizz on non-wash days.  (I have not used it on a wash day).  I definitely agree to spray into your hands and rub together, NOT spray directly on hair.  It's trial and error to figure out how much to use, which would depend on the thickness of your hair. Sometimes I add a little water too, since it's kind of a thicker product.  It doesn't solve the frizz 100% but it's the best thing I've tried so far.",1,4,-3

Obvious difference in this brand is that it only needs 10-20mins to ""cure"" NOT overnight. And you should only keep it on for up to 4hrs. Not keen on those points but it did work nice and came out a good shade. There's recommendations of add INS which is cool. I'd rather get a larger bag of henna then individual boxes to cut back on waste. They do include a plastic head bag for while it's in your hair and that's very useful ! Overall I like this brand and will continue to use it until all 3 boxes are gone My natural hair color is light brown with a few blonde and red highlights, but I’ve always loved red Irish hair. I would have loved to be born a red hair 🤣To enhance some of my natural red highlights, I used to use henna when a was a teenager. Since it was natural and didn’t really change my natural color but just enhance it, my parents allowed me to use it. However, I remember the process being very messy, the henna I used being very sandy (texture-wise), and my hair feeling dry after.In my 20s, I just decided I really wanted my hair to be a bit more reddish than the results I got from henna so I changed to ammonia-free hair dyes. The dye gave the more red hair look I was looking for, but left my hair very brittle and frizzy.When I turned 30 I decided to stop dyeing my hair because it just looked too weak and I couldn’t stand the feeling of it. It felt coarse and no matter what I used, it looked frizzy.4 years later, my hair was finally free of any dye and was looking healthy and shiny, and best of all, was very soft to the touch. But I started to miss my red-hair-self again (lol). I knew I didn’t want to go back to chemical hair dye (my hair is just too fine for it, plus I hate the whole roots growth thing) so I decided to give henna a chance again.I first did a lot of research, and found a YouTube video of a girl with similar natural hair color as mine that used this product and got a gorgeous red tint. I immediately ordered it, but before actually doing it, I did more research to know how to prepare a perfect mix and if it was good for my hair to add lemon to it. Also to know if I actually had to let it cure for four hours before applying it (I never did that before, and that was a totally new thing for me so I needed to know). I also googled about how to avoid henna drying my hair (since it can really be a consequence of using it and it did happen to me before.)I finally Hennaed my hair last night, and I’m sooooo happy with the results I decided to do my first ever amazon review (I’m usually very lazy to do one).This is what I learnt from my research, and what I actually did:1- Applying henna doesn’t have to be messy, you just need to get the right texture. Last night I didn’t make a mess or had henna drooling down my neck for the 4h I kept it. I prepared my mix and applied it when it had the consistency of Greek yoghurt (not too liquid, not too solid).2- Trust the manufacturer’s instructions, at least if it’s your first time. I read so many different recipes, and how you should leave the mix cure, and add some kind of oil to make it more nourishing, etc, that I was really confused. Plus, everyone has a different opinion on what works best. My head was about to explode with all the info, and I remembered I hadn’t actually read Light Mountain’s instructions. I did and I felt soooo much better. They were very simple and even gave tips on what to if you wanted to nourish your hair, or get more golden highlights, etc. They actually also say NOT TO CURE the mix, but to apply it once it is cold enough to be applied.3- Henna quality is essential! Now that I’ve used this henna, I started thinking the one I used to use when I was younger wasn’t as pure or as good quality. I remembered feeling like I had sand on my hair when I was rinsing it out, but this henna is so fine you don’t even feel it! Rinsing it out was very easy, and I was actually very surprised to feel my hair sooooooo soft even while I was rinsing the henna out. It felt like I had put some conditioner on, but I hadn’t. It was just the henna! :DNow, what did I add to my mix?I prepared my henna with chamomile tea and 1 egg. I left it on for 4h and then rinse it out with warm water. Once I had no more residues, I applied a conditioning mask for 1min. I really didn’t need that since my hair was already very soft, but the instructions did say to use some conditioner and I didn’t have any. I just had the mask so I used a bit of that. I then blow dried it so that I wouldn’t go to bed with wet hair and to see the color I had gotten, and OH MY GOD, I’M SO IN LOVE WITH IT!!! The red shade is gorgeous and looks very natural on me. My hair feels very soft and looks lustrous. I haven’t shampooed it yet. It says to better wait at least 24h before doing so, so I’m doing that 🤓I totally recommend this product to anyone wanting to slightly change your hair color without harming it. Your hair will look amazing, and you’ll feel even more beautiful ❤️ I am a natural redhead, but as I am getting older, it is starting to fade to more of a strawberry blonde. To maintain the vibrant color of my youth, I started using henna on my hair a few years ago. I have experience with other brands, and I found this one very easy to work with. The fine powder mixes up well and distributes a nice, even color. It rinses out for the first couple of days more than other brands I’ve used, but then it settles in to a beautiful, natural looking tone. I will probably keep using this one. This product basically works like a hair dying mask for your hair and it does work! It moisturized my hair, made it thicker, and really bonded with my hair. The only downside that I faced was the smell, but with a couple of washes it comes out. It does not matter if you have straight or curly hair, it worked well on my curl type 3C I am a natural redhead. My hair naturally faded to blonde. It was almost platinum blonde in top, like natural highlights.  I got highlights once or twice over 20 years ago,  and I got lowlights about that long ago,  and didn't do any color on my hair since. I researched henna and watched countless how to videos for over 3 years before I took the plunge. It's a commitment.  This stuff doesn't wash out like regular hair dye. I first used Lush in September '21,  and on my platinum blonde hair it looked exactly like I was trying to achieve ""orange popsicle."" It was scary,  BUT I knew with multiple uses it WOULD get darker.  I didn't use Lush again,  because they add extra things like lemon juice extract, which lightens. I got LMN Red and it got somewhat darker,  but I still felt like I had dyed my head ORANGE,  and the orange panic phase was long gone.  It was like orange panic all the time for be because I wasn't used to it! I MIX THE RED AND MEDIUM BROWN 50/50. Even though I wasn't used to it,  EVERYONE LOVED IT. People who know me said I looked like a teenager.  Strangers compliment me all the time. I am not worried about not being seen when I go running.  This stuff stops traffic.  In the sunlight it looks like FIRE.  Funniest compliment so far was when a cashier asked if I was a natural redhead.  I said, ""No,  I mean,  I AM,  but this is henna."" He said he just loves red hair,  and apologized if he stared.  He was trying hard not stare. I had no mascara and had just got done running 6 miles,  but my hair color was on point.  Haha.  He said we redheads must have a ""super power."" So there ya go! It might take you awhile to get used to it, but you'll get so many compliments.  ALL red hair is truly a shade of orange, and it is bold and it is beautiful! My amazing husband doesn't like chemical hair dye, and he kindly put the first application on for me. He doesn't like hair dye, at all.  He likes the natural look.  I was pleasantly surprised that he likes the bold red color.  He even liked the orange popsicle color I had at first. I easily put it on myself,  now.  Sure beats paying someone to do it every 6 weeks! It's super easy.  Can't mess it up.  Watch YouTube videos.  Make sure this is what you want before you do it,  because the only way to get rid of it is to grow your hair out. The more time goes on,  the more natural looking it looks,  or maybe I'm just getting more used to it. Works great!!",2,3,-1

I have no shedding. I recommend Excellent product for damage hair My hair feels so much stronger afterwards! My hair was breaking and falling out and my stylist recommended this with explicit instructions to use it once a month or with a minimum of 17 days between uses or it will have the counter effect. I stuck with once a month and my hair went from breaking, falling out, thinning, and not growing past a certain point before breaking to growing down my back and regaining and retaining its elasticity.I think it was probably over the course of almost two years or so and with me also reducing my usage - I often forget and may go a few months without using it. I have also stopped washing, blow-drying, and curling my hair every day. I say all of that to say it does work. Give it time and do not overprocess your hair.Do note, it does not smell very good. Not necessarily bad, but not good either. I wash my hair once, then treat it with this, let it sit about 10 min and wash my hair at least two or three times to get the smell out, then use my favorite conditioner. Just use it and give it time. You will be pleased, but must be patient. It seemed like it wasn't doing anything while I was over-analyzing it. When I stopped, I suddenly had friends stopping me to ask what I was doing to make my hair so long - which was a combination of this and nothing - no heat, no overwashing, nothing.If you're losing hair, use this, and just wait. It works!***If you found my review helpful, please indicate so by giving it a ""thumbs up"" at the bottom. Thank you!*** This product saved my hair. Before using Affirm 5 in 1 reconstructor, my hair was shedding like crazy. Strands were everywhere. The sink, the floor, brushes, combs...I was literally going bald. No joke, I had a bald spot in the crown of my head. I tried everything. Carol's Daughter Monoi line, Rogaine, weekly shampoos and deep conditionings, protein treatments, vitamins. If it promised to stop hair shedding I tried it. I felt helpless. One day while searching Youtube for answers I came across this product. The stylist who suggested Affirm 5 in 1 reconstructor said that if this product did not stop your shedding and breakage, you need to go see a doctor ASAP. Well I bought this product along with the suggested Mizani Moisturfusion Silk Cream Conditioner and Mizani Milk Bath shampoo I have been a loyal user of Affirm's 5 in 1 reconstructor for over 4 years now. My first experience with this product was when my hairstylist ""mistakenly"" over-processed my hair attempting to put highlights in.  My stylist offered to correct the problem of excess shedding and breakage due to the damaging effects of the highlights with the implementation of the Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor into my weekly visits. Yes, I did say weekly, for some that may be a bit much but for my coarse, thick hair it was ideal! I noticed results immediately with the first application and week after week I noticed less and less shedding and breakage--it took about a month before the breaking and shedding stopped completely. I now have my healthy hair back and even though I do not use the stylist any longer, I do continue to use the 5 in 1 reconstructor! I was  previously using Aphogee as a monthly strengthening  treatment and it does work well, but I prefer Affirm better because I was able to see results quicker with Affirm than Aphogee, also it has a pleasant scent (IMO-Aphogee stinks), it is thicker--it has the consistency of pancake syrup (Aphogee is watery and makes your hair hard after its dry) and you don't have to stay stuck under a hair drier for the product to work. (Please, please, please make sure when you use this product to use a good moisturizing conditioner afterwards and do not use with heat (e.g. placing a plastic cap on and sitting under the drier) as this product has a lot of protein in it and can be very drying; you simply apply the product after washing, applying a plastic cap to your head and then wash out the product after the product has been in your hair for 30 minutes (no heat required) and deep condition with a MOISTURIZING conditioner afterwards!!  I continue to use the Affirm 5 in 1 monthly to maintain the strength of my hair (a week prior to relaxing) and will continue to remain a loyal Affirm  5 in 1 user. This product will always be a mainstay in my hair maintenance regiment.",5,2,3

Leaves Hair pH Balanced for Over-Processed, Environmentally Stressed Hair, Sulfate Free, No Parabens, Color Safe, Gallon Size (Pack of 3)","I liked the shampoo, however one of the bottles leaked about 2/3 of contents inside box. It was a mess!! Of course, we all have different hair, scalp, diet, and health which all makes a difference in what will work for you.  For me, this product is amazing.I'm almost 40 and have no health problems.  My hair is baby fine, mostly straight and fairly long and I have a decent diet.  I also do not dye my hair.I used to have crunchy ends and my roots tend to get oily if not washed every 2-3 days.  Just a little dab of this shampoo and it lathers lightly and rinses out as if I've conditioned my hair.  After years of use and trimming off the crunchy ends, my hair remains soft and silky. No tangles.Most times, I do not use a conditioner after using this shampoo.  After every other shower, or if I use any hot tools, I use in a pea sized drop of leave-in conditioner ( I have fine, wavy hair and I like this shampoo because it makes my hair soft and is gentle yet still cleanses. I've tried several sulfate-free shampoos, and had to go back this one. There is a noticeable difference in softness and curl definition even after one use. I find the lather comparable to sulfate shampoos. I prefer nonscented products and hate sweet or strong smelling shampoo; this one does have a fragrance but it is very mild and more herbal than fruity or sweet, so it doesn't bother me. When I had bought this shampoo locally, it was clear. As you see in the picture here, the product I received from Amazon is more honey-colored. I was worried it was a different formulation or the product was past its prime, but after trying it, it seems to work the same as what I bought in the store. My only change would be with the bottle. The narrow flip top is a bit awkward. My family really loves this shampoo. Since going sulfate free my daughters curly hair is much healthier, my scalp isn't itchy or as flaky, and my hubby likes it as well. I have dyed hair and since switching to this my color isn't fading or stripping. I've tried other sulfate free formulas but they always left my hair feeling greasy after a day. With this im back to shampooing only every three to four days. The bottle sucks, it isn't user friendly, and it's smaller than a normal shampoo bottle. Shampooing with this takes a little practice, make sure hair is super wet and really massage the scalp. You aren't going to get the suds you are used to, but you will see a notable difference after a couple of uses. I only wish I could find a local place to buy:( Wonderful shampoo! This shampoo is great for clarifying, but it also does not strip the hair. It leaves it feeling soft, healthy and clean. Because it doesn't contain any SLS's it doesn't get very sudsy but once you get used to it you hardly notice. I wonder why they really need to put that stuff into the other shampoos at all. It has a very light and pleasant fragrance, but it def. doesn't overwhelm. It smells a tad like apples or something. If you are like me then you will go through one bottle very quickly. I use about 1 every 3 weeks. So you might want to stock up. I think I bought 3 bottles for about $17.50. That's a great deal considering that in most healthfood stores and even at Target, one bottle will cost you upwards of $8. I have been using this shampoo for a few years, and it is great for my curly hair!  My husband recently ran out of his shampoo, and once he tried mine, he started using it too.  It has a nice, light smell and lathers well with a small amount of product.  I often use various other products (mousse, gel, frizz serum), and this shampoo really removes the residue without over-drying my hair.  There are times when I wash my hair multiple times in a day (because of going to the gym or swimming), and I never have had a problem using this gentle product.The value is comparable to buying it at my local organic store, but the subscribe and save discount gives the edge to buying it online. My hair felt softer and looked nicer, shinier and healthier, with less frizzing, from the very first wash. Paired it with my usual conditioner (not the same brand, though I'd be curious to try theirs), and the difference from other shampoos I tried was visible and tangible both before applying conditioner and after (with or without blow drying). Noticed by myself and others. Very pleased with this purchase and would buy again if possible once my stash runs out. I bought this shampoo after reading some positive reviews on Amazon.  I do not regret it.  I wear my hair as a short to moderate length afro, and this shampoo is ideal to wash the hair products out of my hair, so I can get it clean without drying it out.  I pair it with Giovanni's leave in conditioner, and find my hair looks the best it ever has daily.  No need to shampoo and rinse twice either.  This is a great shampoo for all kinds of hair.  My multiracial daughter uses it for her long straight hair, and she loves it too!.  Try it!",1,3,-2

Now that I have natural generational white hair, it's purpose is to keep that white hair from yellowing!!!  This is the most effective lightener that I have found!!!  I will definitely buy this product again and urge others who have the yellowing problem to consider also!!!  With the high cost of salon services, this is very cost effective as one bottle renders several treatments!  This 70 year old head unequivocally recommends this product!!!!! I had severe bassinets from bad haircolor. This removes it temporarily BUT immediately I couldn't really tell a difference in my hair, and I applied it liberally.  My hair is dark with a lot of gray, but saw zero difference in it. I love that this tones the yellow out of my hair. It also makes it softer because my hair is coarse. Ultra White Minx: this stuff is great. In agreement with another reviewer that if your hair is very porous from bleaching and purpley/lavender hair isn’t your bag, try this rinse. Yes, the application seemed weird to me at first: you shampoo your hair and towel it dry, no conditioner (yikes), then saturate your hair with this and blow dry/style as usual. My hair is way bleached.. I was not at all sure that this rinse could possibly condition/add enough to my hair to make up for the absence of conditioner, but it did. There’s evidently a bit of styling lotion in it too, and I do believe the bottle speaks the truth. No lie: my hair was a soft and very bright white after blowing it dry. Texture-wise, it was smooth, thickened, and had a little bit of grip from the styling lotion; it held the wave thing I make in the front very easily. And it was shiny. Very pleased with this product. It helps with color a bit after shampoo no conditioner per instructions but makes easier to comb long hair before blow drying it. Less frizzy hair after blow drying with it in after shampoo washed. Now I use deep conditioner after about two weeks and still have soft hair. I have Blonde Highlights only rest is natural dark hair. I love using the product I live up in the mountains. The closest store that I could buy this from is 4 hours one way.So, when I tried to highlight my own hair, before going home for Christmas, I turned it orange! This was 4 days from my flight!I panicked. Thank goodness I received it in only 2 days!I love this product ! I need to stock up.Don't be afraid to use a lot of it. I have found the more the better and it takes away my tangles, which says a lot. Most no tangle products don't even do that, and makes my hair shiny.",4,5,-1

I like the product, but the seller sent the product yesterday in an envelope with no plastic cap on the pump bottle.  I'll buy from another source next time. This is a great product Not as good as ""Kenra Rough Paste"", but an excellent substitute when you're out of Kenra. A little goes a long way. Don't use too much or your hair will look oily. Use a pea size amount, rub between hands and through the hair avoiding the root. It sets your style and adds separation and all day hold. The container was missing the cap! Holds my hair up and let’s me style it and stays in for hours. Especially with my thick hair I need something with a little more structure and this works just perfectly. I liked this product,  I've using for a while now,  it's keeps the hair in place and after a while your hair gets nice and soft. This hair product is among the best on the market. It really works with my hair, and styling.The first time I ordered this it was great, no shipping issues at all. However, when I went to buy a replacement bottle, I received the bottle on the right. As you can see from the picture the bottle is completely destroyed and all crinkled. I then started the return process and chose for them to send me a replacement thinking this was a one-time fluke and that the replacement would be perfect. However I was disappointed when the package arrived and there was no lid for the second bottle. Not a big problem because I have a spare lid from my old bottle but the quality control on this has really gone downhill from when I purchased it first about four months ago. Something to keep an eye on in the future.I would highly recommend this hair product to anyone with thick hair but just be careful on the quality control, as you may have to do some returns.",1,4,-3

The second time I ordered, I got the Color Protection Shampoo with ""ProQuinoa Complex with Coconut and sage"". Both times, I ordered from this very same page from Amazon LLC. So I'm not sure if there is any way to control which you get.As soon as I opened my second bottle, I knew it was different from the scent. The old one (Aloe & rosa canina) smells like fruity rosy cherries. The new one (coconut & sage) smells like very sweet vanilla'd coconut. Scent-wise I prefer the coconut as I tend to dislike fruity scents. The scent does err on the strong side, but it doesn't linger once you rinse it out. Other than the fragrance, I don't notice any big differences. But YMMV as I am not picky about shampoo.On the actual product- I do like both shampoos. Both lather well for a sulfate-free shampoo, much more than my previous DermOrganic (I know lather isn't correlated with cleanliness, I just can't get over the lather-need society has conditioned in me); clean hair well WITHOUT drying or further damaging my damaged, colored hair at all; both have pleasant fragrance that rinse out and do not linger in hair. Color still bleeds and fades from my hair, but that is inevitable with my combination of damaged/overprocessed hair + red dye (which I'm sure you know fades very fast!). My overall color still lasts quite a while before needing a refresher, actually quite long considering how damaged my hair is.Again I am not picky about shampoo, it just has to be gentle, yet clean well, have some lather, be sulfate free, have no terrible ingredients or overwhelming fragrance, affordable and cruelty free. For some reason a shampoo that fulfills all of those is hard to find, but ABBA fits my basic needs well. So I would consider this shampoo a success and will continue to repurchase whichever version of ABBA Color Protect Amazon decides to throw at me. A few folks on a haircare forum recommended this to me when I was asking about moisturizing shampoos.  I've only used this twice so far, but I love how rich it is and how healthy my hair feels after using it. It has a lovely, rose-like scent, and you need just the smallest amount to clean your hair.  It's also sulfate- and silicone-free for those following the Curly Girl routine.I have red tones in my hair and red is notorious for fading very quickly, so I'm hoping that this extends the vibrancy of my color.  Since I haven't used it for too long, I can't yet comment on its color-protecting abilities, but I will update my review as I use this more. For now, I love it!UPDATE ON 3/28/13:  I've been using this since last August, and it really does make your color last a lot longer.  In fact, I've noticed that it takes a good four weeks for my base color to fade enough to see my highlights since this does such a good job of keeping the color on your hair.  It's a great product! Bought this to take on vacation. I’ve used this product for years. What was in the bottle was NOT the shampoo I have been using. It did not smell like it and it did not lather. It was in the white bottle so don’t know if the it old and deactivated or something else was out on there. What a waste of money! I have been using this shampoo and hair conditioner for years.  I don't color my hair any more, but continue to use it because it is gentle, low scent, and very moisturizing. It gives a nice body to the hair. I absolutely love ABBA hair shampoo and conditioner.  This is a vegan product. There are no harsh chemicals.  For my hair, used to resemble straw until my hairstylist recommended this product. With in 3 shampoo and conditioner,  my hair is soft to the touch. And no more straw. Btw. I am 62 and you could never guess my age by my hair.  Thanks ABBA  and Amazon for carrying such a great product at a great price! Previously I had been using kerastase, which I loved. However, I figured another sulfate-free shampoo would have the same effect and this was cheaper. It left my hair feeling unclean ang greasy at the crown after just 12 hours or so. The scent was not appealing at all, either. I generally do not leave bad reviews, but I felt compelled to share as buying a shampoo without being able to smell it first can be iffy. Perhaps because it is vegan it has a stale smell instead of the typically bright smells associated with good shampoo.  I will just find a better smelling sulfate-free shampoo or go back to Kerastase. The scent is better and the formula is still great. Not sure if this is an old formula, but the shampoo I received is nothing like the bottle of the same shampoo I just finished using, and had purchased from a chain drugstore. It has absolutely no lather, and the scent is nothing like the Abba Color Protect shampoo I had before this one. Also, the cap on the bottle was shattered when I received it, which wasn't s huge deal because I just replaced it with the cap from my old bottle.I was really happy to find this shampoo on Amazon as my local drugstore no longer carries it. The ""real"" formula, or maybe just a more current one, is great, definitely the best shampoo I've used in a long time. The trouble is that the shampoo I got from this seller on Amazon is not the same shampoo. It is so bad that I will have to just throw it away and find another source. So bummed!Edit 2/14/13Thought it was only fair to edit this review as I've come to realize that the NEW formula may be the one that I don't like. Can't blame the seller for this. I still give it one star though because this shampoo went from the best ever to the worst ever!",1,2,-1

The comb works for my straight hair and feels pretty durable I love this comb. My hair is thick and long(think Rapunzel) ... yes, that long.  This is awhopper of a comb - large! And sturdy!  Justwhat I wanted for the shower after conditioner.IF there are any seams, I can't find them.This is not a LOVE YOUR scalp comb... it's notfor massage or anything - but if you have seriouslylong (white chick) hair - this comb is for you.Goody combs seem small to me and too flexible.I've even had a Goody comb break on me. ""snap!"" -NOT this comb.  Okay HATE HATE HATE the color thisawful rusty/orangey/faded almost tan but tooorange to be tan color - but who cares (that much).It's a great comb that feels very verysubstantial in the hand.  It's too big to loseand I love that part the most!  I'm trying togrow my hair even longer and with this combI notice at least 70% less hair wrapped around thecomb after a comb-thru after conditioner (youknow what I mean).  So buy it and don't say Inever did you a favor.People with shoulder length or shorter hair -or very fine/thin hair have no need for sucha hefty comb.  BUT I DO!Thanks DIANE COMB!!!! I love using this in the shower. It’s perfect when applying my hair mask. This comb is extremely sturdy, and a fantastic price. It’s a definite must have. I'm completely infatuated with this comb. Firstly, you do get 12 - which is more than one person could ever need. A salon brand, so I suppose they're probably packaged for that purpose.  I don't care. It just makes them an amazing value, per comb.  I'll be well stocked for combs for myself and whomever wants one for a while now ^_^If you have very long, very thick, and/or wavy-to-curly hair - this is the absolute perfect comb for detangling. My boyfriend doesn't even need a wide-toothed comb, but he says he likes this one because the teeth don't scratch his head.What's more, they're quite sturdy combs. Mine stays loose in my purse and I'm not the slightest bit concerned about teeth breaking.I'd recommend this not only for people who want to comb their own hair, but if you're combing a child's hair too.  Much gentler than another comb or brush.  This and detangling spray should make for painless work :]I will note that the ""bone"" color isn't what a I pictured at all. I pictured off-white, but it's kind of an orangey-brown, and I don't really like it - but it's not worth taking a star off. The color's growing on me anyway. It’s a comb.",4,4,0

I use this product after I cleanse my hair to add extra volume for styling. I like this as it does seem to smooth my naturally curly, Chelsea-in-the-White-House-Days or Carole-King-like frizzy hair. However, I was hoping that it would be effective enough to replace the Curls Rock curls amplifier I was using to control the frizz. Unfortunately, it isn't. I have been using it somewhat successfully in combination with the Curls Rock, but it is not effective enough to use by itself as a leave-in condition. And for all those who will immediately ask if I tried the Fig Wen cleanser, yes I did. Read my separate review on that. I added this product to the trial package (no subscription) I ordered here on Amazon. I wanted to use the same hair care routine I normally use when I experimented to see if WEN was a good product for me.  I normally use a volumizer on my roots and bangs as well as a leave-in product. This styling creme is very similar to the WEN cleansing conditioner, but not as heavy or thick. And you don't use as much. It smells great. And doesn't leave a ""sticky"" feel to my hands after using like the volumizer does. My hair doesn't feel weighed down or get extra dirty between washings. I french braid all or part of my hair a couple of times a week. So I was surprised to see that when I undo the braids, the styling creme has helped to ""set"" that wavy look hair gets after hours of being braided. I put my hair in a bun when I sleep and the next day, the waves are still strong enough to wear with my hair either down or in a double ponytail. After several uses, I'm pleased with the WEN styling creme and how it performs on my hair. I'm trying all the products I ordered for three months. I'll update my review shortly after that and let you know if I'm still wildly impressed and a true believer convert! I have recently become a fan of wen products cleansing products. Unfortunately, this styling creme was not a part of that adoration. I have tried this 3 times and each time, it leaves my hair feeling hard.  I have tried it with wet hair and with dry and it just is not for me. I will continue to use the cleansing fig, and sweet almond as they have had my hair looking a lot healthier and much less shedding. I am still testing this product and so far so good. I like it but don't love it. My hair is really frizzy and curly. I am thinking maybe the combination I am using is not enough to tame my curls. But the product is pretty thick (which I need) and creamy. But, I am thinking I need more juicy instead lol. We will see I am still testing the product as I mention in the title. I purchased WEN Fig and Pomegranate cleansing conditioners and styling crèmes, and as I write this review I am combing my own hair myself, (a whole section of hair is in a decent braid out) which I never could do myself before using WEN. Instead, my mother and hairdressers had to contend with this coarse 4b/c hair of mine. In short, these are miracle products, answered prayers. If you are of African descent with similar coarse kinky hair then this product I assure you will say bye-bye to your hair woes and product junkie lifestyle.The only beef is as a natural-conscious product user (I'm an avid user of Burt's Bees products), I hope any future improvements that may be made to WEN Fig Styling Crème specifically includes also removing propylene glycol from it. :-) I have extremely dry brittle hair from years of coloring and highlighting. I decided to use the WEN line since I've pretty much tried everything else out there. I think the Sweet Almont Mint conditioner is probably the best out of all of the products for dry hair. I was not impressed by the results after using the Fig Styling Creme. It smells great but it didn't do much for quenching my dry locks.",1,4,-3

My son has spent months trying different hair products, and not liking any of them. I finally convinced him to let me use my Osis products to style his hair, and sure enough, he fell in love! I purchased this matte hair paste to try as an alternative to the texturing powder we already had. My son absolutely loves it! Holds his style all day without looking shiny or wet. Like the consistency and it adds body. Buen producto permite moldear el cabello fácil, no deja grasoso el cabello Good stuff shipped fast Excelente!! Osis is my go to paste for styling my hair. It is not sticky like other waxes and holds just as well. I've tried Gatsby, American Crew, Bed Head, etc. and always find myself coming back to Osis. As an Asian with thick hair, it can be difficult to style with other brands. Osis paste works the best. Here's my routine:For a slicker look (more control, but heavier)1. towel dry my hair so that it is damp - not wet.2. add about a dime sized amount of paste and work it into my hair.3. blow dry hair ALWAYS going in the direction you're trying to style.4. add another dime sized amount for extra hold.For a more matte look (less control, but airy)1. towel and blow dry hair until completely try2. add dime sized amount of paste and work into hair3. add small amounts when needed for stubborn parts of your hair I think this hair product has mixed reviews because it all depends on the type of hair a person has. I have straight and thick hair, so when it is on the longer side, I feel that it works much better it maintaining the style than when I have a shorter cut/ style. It was pretty gooey and I am not sure what to make of the smell, its scent is industrial, that is the word that comes to mind, its scent is definitely different from products such as FIBER from American Crew which I like and is the most versatile for me. I probably would not buy this product again considering the scent and the limited use because it depends on the length and style my hair has to be in order to use this product effectively. Other products to consider depending on your help type would be MOP, American Crew Pomade, FIBER, forming cream or molding clay, and a good favorite of mine Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Shaping Cream, it has a great scent. to hold your style in place I would recommend MOP's C system eco friendly hair spray, just a little bit of spray goes a long way and it smells great that the ladies will notice and it doesn't make your hair stiff.",1,5,-4

It cost a little more, but I like the way it works on my hair. But the last bottle of Enjoy shampoo I ordered from Amazon was very watery compared to what I have had in the past. Usually, it's very thick, the shampoo and conditioner. It was too late to return.The conditioner was fine. My purchase history shows that I have bought this shampoo and conditioner 19 times. Well, the last time I bought it, the shampoo was very watery. I’m really hesitant to buy it again. :-/ Okay, I've never written a review on any shampoo/conditioner before.  Probably because I've never been impressed, or even excited by any shampoo/conditioner before.  I have fine, color treated, blonde hair that has always been somewhat dry, and lacking of body.  I've tried most every brand name of shampoo/conditioner on the market, from the expensive salon brands to cheaper 'Just Like' brands.  So, I was shopping for shampoo/conditioner on Amazon the other day, and after filtering my search, came across the Enjoy Luxury Duo.  I read the reviews, and thought...  Yeah, yeah, yeah...  these people probably have beautiful hair to begin with, and this is just another product that promises to make my dull lifeless hair come to life again.  I've tried everything else, so why not try this brand, too?  I ordered the Enjoy Luxury Duo, and it arrived as promised.  This is where my story gets interesting...  After one use, my hair had more bounce.  After two applications, my hair had a noticable shine.  And, after day 3, I'm in love with my hair!  I really didn't think a shampoo/conditioner duo could make a difference with my hair, but I'm happily wrong!  It may appear to be spendy, but I have shoulder length hair, and only need the size of a quarter to do the job.  It smells wonderful, and rinses without a problem.  (Yes, I have soft water.)  I'm so glad I found the Enjoy line of hair care products.  I'm going to try the hairspray next.  This reviewer highly recommends you give it a try. I’ve purchased this product 13 times over the last 6-7 yrs and LOVE it. The last time I purchased the shampoo it was very watered down and isn’t cleansing my hair.  Unfortunately, I’m past the return window. Great moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Smells great I am so disappointed in this company! This is the second time I've ordered this product. The first time I ordered it, I was blown away at how well it worked that I told everyone I know about it. The first bottles that I ordered lasted almost an entire year, because they were so concentrated. When it came time to reorder, I did it without hesitation. I was deeply disappointed when the new bottles came in the mail. The shampoo, in particular, is so runny that it doesn't even lather up! It is so different from the first time I ordered it, I could not believe it! Talk about shrinkflation! This company should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass this formula off as the same. The conditioner was fine but the shampoo is watered down. It used to be viscous and very concentrated. You didn’t need much to wash my long hair. This last bottle was so watery. It ran off the sides of my hand and I had to use much much more to actually clean my hair. Very disappointed. I've used this for over 3+ years now.  I have super long thick wavy/curly hair, many thanks to this Enjoy Luxury duo. My hair is half white, and those ""grey"" hairs are even more delicate than the blonde hair of my youth. I no longer color my hair, it's already a party of colors, but the white hairs are so delicate, I find this product takes care of it best. I have successfully grown out my hair, starting at barely past my shoulders, it's now down to my waist!  I have soft water in my house, and I only use a small amount to wash and condition, I have no problems rinsing in soft water. Feels clean, smells clean. A wide thick pump is a necessity, the liter size bottles are too heavy to squeeze out this thick product. This liter sized duo lasts me about a year, coming out to about $7 per month. It's SO WORTH IT.  I ride horses and get pretty dusty and stinky, but I can wash my hair twice in one day without worrying that I'm over-washing it. I use the Enjoy hair and body oil to control the frizzies on humid days. I will always use this shampoo and conditioner, best price is found here online.  This Enjoy Luxury duo hasn't caused a build-up, and works as awesome today as it did the first use 3+ years ago.Great shampoo n conditioner!",1,3,-2

So I was searching for a good organic shampoo & conditioner when I got pregnant, and chose this shampoo due to good reviews.  Now I can't live without it!  It cleans my hair great, smells wonderful, and is light but not drying.  I also like that it is safe for color-treated hair.  I've been using it on my strawberry-blonde locks and haven't lost a hint of color.PLUS- I have also been dealing with a really embarrassing new [for me] issue - scalp psoriasis, and once I got pregnant I couldn't use the topical steroids that had been prescribed to treat it.  Once I started using this shampoo, the psoriasis went away!  I couldn't believe it, but told my dermatologist and she said it is very believable, as the chemicals in most shampoos can aggravate skin problems.  She now recommends this shampoo to all of her patients. I know it is the shampoo that stopped it, because a couple of times I ran out and had to use another shampoo, and each time my psoriasis came back.My one gripe is that I have long, thick hair, and this doesn't lather like ""regular"" shampoos - but neither do any organic ones (it's the sulfates that cause the lather, but they also strip your scalp and fade color-treated hair).  Due to this, I go through a lot of it, so I wish they sold it in larger bottles! The price is also more than I usually spend, but sooo worth it.P.S. The conditioner I chose is John Masters Organics Lavender & Avocado Intensive Conditioner, and I love it just as much! This smells amazing and is definitely not too strong. I have medium thick, dark blonde hair which has only been silkier since using this. It's very gentle and cleans without stripping, which is good for my highlights. My hair does get a little greasy towards the end of the day, but then again it does no matter what I use. If you feel like it doesn't clean as well as your old shampoo, it's because you're used to the squeaky feeling of stripping your hair with chemicals!Some advice: read the directions. Shake the bottle before using it, because it really helps it to lather. I only use a little bit, rinse it out, and then wash my hair again. This also helps it lather more. It is more on the pricey side, and I do feel like I have to use a little more of it than my old shampoo, but look at the bright side: you're doing wonders for your hair and skin. The acne on my forehead has cleared up since using this- no more sulfates and chemicals! I have recently been switching all my hair products to organic or all natural.  It's hard finding something natural that can replace what chemicals can do for your hair.  Unfortunately, those chemicals do a lot more than make your hair feel smooth and silky.  After looking at ingredients and seeing all the toxic things companies use, I've said enough.  So on to my search for good all natural or organic products.  John Masters makes great products.  My hair is fine and very tempermental.  This shampoo works, but it does make my hair tangly and a little too squeaky clean.  But most shampoos do that to my hair and the conditioners more than make up for that.  So I give it four stars, for being made from awesome ingredients and doing it's job.  Just make sure you get a good conditioner too. This shampoo is a dark brownish color. I had never seen a shampoo this color before and it did not occur to me to check on the color before buying it. I do not want to put a dark color shampoo on my hair so I have not used this shampoo. It has a nice scent. I was given a trial size gift pack of John Masters Organics products and then ordered this shampoo in a larger package.  If it had been possible to have rated this product as a ""4.75"", I would have done so.  The one negative is the color and appearance.  The shampoo is a clear liquid, dark brown in color.  The 'dark brown' gave me a moment's pause.  But the positive attributes of the product clearly outweigh the appearance.  This shampoo is not one that produces suds and bubbles....in fact, almost none.  What it does is leave one's hair squeaky clean and very shiny.  Personally, I could not be less concerned with its bubbleless lack of suds.  What I do love is the way it leaves my hair.....and then there's it's exquisitely clean aroma......lavender rosemary - which is a mood lifter in itself.  I've now used 3/4 of my bottle of this shampoo and am ready to re-order it!  I love it! I am in the process of No-Pooing and I bought this to supplement on days I really need a good clean.First of all, it smells great! It lathers much better than I expected and it totally gets the job done. One of the main reasons a shampoo lathers well, are chemicals. If you go organic, you should always expect less lather. This is a given. The way I work around this is to only put a small amount in my palm and work each section individually. That way I don't waist the product by having too much in one area and not enough in another.If you are interested in ""no-poo"" (not using shampoo anymore) take a look at my blog. My hair has NEVER felt better and I have eliminated countless chemicals and 4 products I used to use every day!Only issue I have with this product is the price. It's pretty high.[...] Great product. Very clean. I was formerly an Aveda addict. Had to buy this when I ran out of Aveda and was traveling where there were no Aveda shops. That was a year ago, and I've been on John Masters' products ever since.My scalp feels much healthier. Aveda Scalp Benefits was good for that, but it was recently discontinued and this product is much better. It cleans my scalp & hair without stripping them, but does not leave a greasy residue like other organic shampoos can.I have both a dry, itchy scalp AND greasy hair. This addresses both issues. Would highly recommend it.",2,5,-3

I really love Bed Head products especially the moisturizing shampoos, rinse and Control Freak.  I also loved Shine Junkie too but I can't find that anywhere. If you have thick, curly/frizzy hair it really helps calm it down with no greasy feeling or heaviness :) !! Great  product . I thought that this was going to leave my hair silky and smooth and it did that but my hair feels gross to touch and I feel like there’s gel and oil dried to my hair. This is likely for more curly hair you are trying to straighten. My hair is straight I just use serums on my hair to make it silky and soft to touch and bouncy and it does not really do much for my hair type. I’m not saying it wouldn’t be awesome for others as some people’s hair handles product much better it just wasn’t for me.*****UPDATE****** after my hair settled after styling it, it’s much more smooth to the touch and silky and I love it. Just don’t like how it feels shortly after doing my hair. It feels like gel that’s got a different feel to it. It’s not staticky at all and I do like it. This is the best product that I have used. I have fine hair and this adds volume without weighing it down. This product works great.  I have frizzy curly hair and this product really helps control this!  I have tried many, many products and this works the best for me by far. Love Bed Head productWhen I cut my hair short, I wanted a serum to help with flyaways and this product was recommended by hairstylist.Im a no nonsense woman, no makeup or anything.This serum is great and non sticky. Upon moving to Florida, my hair frizzed out like nothing I've ever experienced before. I've used other anti-frizz products, but they were no match for the humidity down here. I bought this because I've used other TIGI products before and had good experiences. This did not disappoint.First, and most importantly, it ACTUALLY WORKS. I'm not going to say I don't have any frizz whatsoever since using this, but it's barely noticeable and lasts ALL DAY. Whether my hair is up or down, whether I'm out and about running errands or hanging around outside in the yard, it works. You can use it on dry hair or wet hair, and I've tried both with favorable results. I have noticed it seems to work better on dry hair.It also smells great. Other reviews complained about the smell being ""chemical,"" but to me it smells great, almost fruity. It has a shiny sheen to it when you squirt it out onto your hand, but it doesn't translate to your hair. On top of that, my hair feels extremely soft after using it. I find myself running my fingers through it after applying the serum just to enjoy the silkiness. I would definitely buy this again and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, effective anti-frizz product.",5,5,0

Using this helps for about 2 days most, when I'm sweating a lot. If I have days that I'm not so actively sweating. It lasted about a week and then back at it again. To me, it had a menthol smell that can be loud at first then it settles down, after about 24 hours. I will definitely buy this again. I wish it was a little more inexpensive. I saw a TikTok and tried to use this product to take the glue off my wig. It did not work for me. No time to wash your hair? Use this!

I have to curl my hair the night before or hours before I'm going somewhere with this because it makes tight curls.  I like the curls to relax before going somewhere. Then they are beautiful beach curls after waiting. This is my second buy. I bought my first one years ago but after we moved, I couldn’t find it so I bought another. I cut my hair shorter and needed the tighter curl and this iron gives the perfect, smaller curls. Still a great buy. Great curling iron My hair is too short for this tool. I’m sure if it were quite long it would work much better. I purchased this as a replacement to the bedhead spiral iron that I had. I like this one more than that because the temperature adjustment does not move while you are using it, and the cord does not wrap up when you are twisting it.  My only gripe is that is came up when searching for an iron for long hair, and it is definitely not. My hair is shorter now that it has been in years ( Couple inches past shoulder length) and still have to curl each section piece twice, once for the top half of the hair and once for the bottom.  It does pinch the hair too much to be able to start and the top and just twist/spin it all the way though. ( Maybe this can be solved by using a heatproof glove and avoiding the clip).Overall this is a good iron, it would just be nice if they made them for longer hair.  I've had a spiral curler since I was a little girl and always loved it so when my finally broke and I had to find a new one the number of different choices and options is overwhelming I was pleased to find this one just like my last one if I had any complaint at all it would be the location of the on off button that gets accidentally push while still using other then that great product My wife uses it and she was happy",3,5,-2

Tried several other Aubrey shampoos, including Honeysuckle (too drying) and Rose Mosqueta (ditto, only less so). Running out of ideas, I noted that Blue Chamomile made claims to be 'moisturizing'.. and guess what, it is! My hair is dry and damaged in places through years of using heated appliances and hair lightener (Revlon Colorsilk- cheap and recommended!) Aubrey Blue Chamomile addresses the issue better than any other shampoo I've used, and I have a strong preference to stay with Aubrey because of their quality formulations. It was just a matter of finding the right one- and now with this one, I think I have my hair on the right track to being in better condition. Still use Aubrey GPB conditioner for alternate shampoos, and entirely pleased with the result. So I can recommend this product without reservation. (Would have given it five stars but for the fact that my hair remains a bit dry in the worst spots, so I can truly say I like this product very much, but stop just short of loving it!)UPDATE 3/20/2014: After using this moisturizing shampoo for over a year now, there seems to have been a formulation change. It dries my hair! I was using Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle as a clarifying shampoo every 4-5 times, as recommended by a reviewer, but now have reversed it so that this is my 'clarifying' or alternative shampoo and Trader Joe's the primary! My hair seems more moisturized with the Tea Tree Tingle. Figure that out! Still recommend this product for its non-chemicalized ingredients- we need as many options as possible- but with the caveat that it may not moisturize as well as expected- or as well as previously! Where to start... I really liked the original Blue Chamomile shampoo product, and on my second (or third?) purchase discovered that unfortunately it's not the same product anymore. The color is different, the texture is much more watery, it has an entirely different smell... it's like a different product completely. I am dumbfounded, and don't understand why a company like Aubrey Organics felt the need to make several changes to a product that was already great to start with (as you can see by all earlier Amazon reviews). Why make so many changes to the formula of a product that was averaging 4.5 (or 4) stars out of 5.0 stars?Hopefully Aubrey Organics will listen to its customers regarding this important issue and rethink its approach to 'fixing' great products. I think Aubrey Organics is still a good company and they're certainly doing customers (and themselves) a favor by staying GMO-free and believing in transparency, but returning (and new) customers also need to be aware of how much the ingredients have changed in a once great product. Even the order (which denotes quantity used from most to least) of ingredients has changed. For example, aloe barbadensis leaf juice* used to be the third in quantity used, now it's the fifth in quantity used. Here goes:Blue Camomile Hydrating ShampooINGREDIENTS (OLD PRODUCT):  (I would've rated this 4 stars, one star removed due to alcohol and what appears to be non-organic soybean being used. Soybean is the most common gmo out there. Aubrey Organics should make clear that its soybean is organic or non-gmo given this consideration)Aqua, decyl glucoside, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, sodium cocoyl hydrolyzed soy protein, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter)*, oryza sativa (rice) extract*, glycerin, citrus grandis (grapefruit) extract, tanacetum annuum (Moroccan blue camomile) oil*, glyceryl linolenate, alcohol denat. (38b, lavendar*), tocopheryl acetate, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, equisetum hyemale (horsetail) extract, tussilago farfara (coltsfoot) leaf extract, ascorbic acid, glycine soja (soybean) oil, daucus carota sativa (carrot) root extract, beta-carotene.*OrganicINGREDIENTS (NEW PRODUCT):Aqua, lauryl glucoside, decyl glucoside, sodium lauroyl lactylate, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, glycerin, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, citrus grandis (grapefruit) extract, oryza sativa (rice) extract*, sodium phytate, tanacetum annuum oil*, sodium cocoyl hydrolinoleic acid, tocopherol, alcohol, equisetum hyemale extract, tussilago farfara (coltsfoot) leaf extract, linolenic acid, citric acid.*Organic It takes a lot getting used to without all the bubble or foam making that many other sulfate shampoo products have. The smell isn't the tropical or apple or ocean breeze scent that you normally would get from other everyday shampoo. It has a unique and herby smell to it. It took a while getting used to too. A greenish funky gel looking color comes out of the bottle and that was something I wasn't used to. That was because many of the the shampoo sold in stores are of a bright and shiny color, which tends to disguise themselves as clean and safe when really it's just our consumer perception. Sulfate is found in much of the shampoo and soap we use everyday. It'll dehydrate your skin and damage it. Because of that, I have decided to try this Aubrey shampoo product. It's been working out for me so far and I just absolutely love the concept. Their packaging is biodegradable, which I'm kind of skeptical about and don't even know how that works, but I thought that was cool. It's sulfate-free and cruelty-free! Not only that it's priced at a reasonable price. Shampoo is always a challenge for me. I am allergic to yellow dye which is in so many shampoos, conditioners, soaps, lotions, cosmetics. I think I have developed an allergy or sensitivity to sulfates too because even shampoo without yellow dye was beginning to irritate my scalp and leave it dry, itchy and flakey - yuk! I saw this shampoo, read the wonderful reviews and ordered this shampoo along with some Aubrey Natural Conditioner and VOILA - No more dry itchy scalp! I also have very fine and very long hair (past my butt) and I live in humid Florida where frizz and flyaways are commonplace. This shampoo  leaves my hair smooth and soft without weighing it down. If I comb my hair before I shampoo, I can comb it out without a lot of tangles after shampoo. I've never even attempted to do it without also using conditioner though. I was pleasantly surprised at how little shampoo I needed to get a good lather even with my long hair. It has a light clean scent. My granddaughter loves to bury her face in my hair. She said it smells clean. I really love that it's organic and I highly recommend. I will definitely reorder!",1,2,-1

I will not buy this again as I feel the quality is not what it used to be after the company was sold.I am a long long time Aubrey fan and still use the face moisturizer and skin lotion.  I never thought I would be writing a review like this for an Aubrey product.  Hey we vote with our dollar and this company hopefully will listen and change the ingredients. The only reason I'm giving this one 4 stars instead of 5 is just personal scent preference. It smells a bit likeOld Spice - which is a little more masculine than I usually prefer. Also - it would be great if it came in a larger size, because I go through it quite quickly. But apart from that - this is a fantastic conditioner - unlike most ""organic"" and ""natural"" hair and skin care products - Aubrey Organics really is completely natural - no chemicals or icky additives snuck in - even their preservatives are chemical free - managing to find things in nature to do the trick.I've been going back and forth for a few years trying to find the perfect hair care line for my hair (Its hip length, and I plan to continue growing it out). Of all the shampoos and conditioners I've ever used, Aubrey's has been the asbolute best - health wise as well as results wise...This type of conditioner is absolutely great for dry hair - and if the scent had been a tad bit less masculine it would have easily gotten 5+ stars! :-) I actually love this brand, and I have purchased Island Naturals conditioner from them for years, but they changed the formulation and kept the same name! So disappointing. The conditioner works fine, so I gave it a second star, but it's HIGHLY scented. The old formulation had a fairly strong scent as well, I admit, but it was more herbal. This is very fruity. I'm using it, but I'm not loving it. I have been using this shampoo & conditioner for several months now and I will probably look for another when they run out. My hair is very dry and there seems to be a lot of chlorine in our water. I wash it about once a week with just conditioner ""washes"" in between. My hair does seem healthier and it's chemical free. I do like the conditioner better than the shampoo. This is my first natural hair care so it's competing with chemical shampoos & conditioners I have grown up using. I would come back if I did not find something natural that worked better. A bit of a strong scent - reminds me of the smell when my wife gets her hair colored.But it is truly organic! I've not met the hair cutter yet, who can put their shears in my hair without saying, ""My gosh, you've got the thickest head of hair I have ever seen."" From there, they go on to say things like, ""You've got enough hair for six people,"" or my number one favorite hair-cutter comment, ""You've got the hairiest neck I've ever seen on a woman.""But I digress.It's tough for people like me to find hair-care products that really work. Heck, it's hard to find hairbrushes that don't break. I can't tell you how many hairbrushes I've broken. Usually the darn handle breaks right off.For 35 years, I've been looking for a conditioner that will work with my wild brunette locks, and Aubrey Organics is it. Funny thing is, I don't like the shampoo product offered in this same line, but the conditioner is fantastic. It only takes a little dab and it smooths out the angriest of tangles (and I have some pretty angry tangles).Perhaps we've all become accustomed to the sugary sweet scents of the mainstream products, but I found the unique smell of this conditioner to be quite pleasant. Different people like different things, but I do not like the heavy sweetness of contemporary shampoo products.In short, I've become a faithful customer of this product since first discovering it at a health food store about two years ago. Unfortunately, I can no longer find it locally and have to buy it here at Amazon every two or three months. However, it's a good price and shipping isn't too bad. This conditioner was thick and had a nice scent, but made my hair dry and brittle after washing it out. I even added a little olive oil for extra moisturizing and it did not make a difference. It also felt heavy while rinsing out of my hair almost as if there was some kind of film left on my hair. Perhaps I used too much (1/4 of the bottle) on my thick hair. I'm too scared to try it again. It took me two weeks to get my hair almost back to normal. Detangles my very tangle-prone, curly 3b/c hair quickly and easily. I love the smell. I have severe allergies and asthma, yet the smell does not bother me at all. It is less spicy smelling than I remember from before they changed the formula, but it still works. I just wish it was not so expensive, or I would use this regularly. I have to use a lot of conditioner at a time, so this is more of a treat than a staple I use every wash. That's the only reason it loses a star.",2,4,-2

Made in England","I collected antique combs for years. Nothing new is better made than a Kent comb. In my collection I have only two antique combs both made of ivory and sterling that are a shade better still there is nothing made today that equals the quality and styles of a Kent Comb. You challenge will be selecting the right style of comb for you. Over the last 30 years I have had 3 different styles as my hair has thinned and become less strong. Glides through your hair Love them and they almost look and feel like the real thing No complaints about this comb. It will likely last longer than I do. Nice finish on the Kent combs. They don't pull or snag on your whiskers and glide through your beard. Great to use on medium to long beards. I will definitely be getting a couple more for my beard care. I highly recommend them. I love the weight and feeling of the comb.  I have always bought cheap dime store combs and never realized what a difference a good comb can make. I have used ACE combs for years I mean they're like $2-$3 and always get the job done. Well I found myself in need of a new comb and had a good deal more disposable income than in the past so I decided to splurge. Little did I realize what it was I was missing out on. It may be such a mundane task combing ones hair, but this one does it in such a way that my scalp notices. No more scratches no more feeling dry. I actually look forward to doing my hair now. I have a straight hair on my beard and its very dense, however after my beard has grown 5.5 inches long, the bottom of the beard under the chin started to curl and was looking messy. Everyday morning when i get ready for the office it was a struggle to set right my beard as i wanted to make it look straight by combing it in downward direction. The situation was very tricky as i started to comb more vigorously with cheap plastic comb (the teeth of such combs are generally very sharp) it started to damage the skin under my beard.  For many weeks i felt the pain near the chin and never realized that it was the plastic comb which was creating the issue and finally i did. These plastic combs  will  have small ridges on each tooth that can easily damage hair and cause breakage to your beard or scalp.If you ask the beards-men he can explain the pains of growing a beard as you gothrough phases like itches, scruff, dandruff,curls etc. Therefore its very important to use a hand made comb which doesn't cause any damage to your cuticles.At one point of time i wanted to hack down the beard as the situation was really getting out of hands.  This was the time i visited my friend who came from UK and i happen to see variety of kent combs and brushes on his toiletry kit(almost 3-4). I took this Kent saw cut 6T and combed my beard and was amazed to see that it was gliding through my beard effortlessly and felt a massaging effect on my beard.I decided to give it a shot and within 1 hour i placed the order with Amazon and which was delivered within 5 days by Amazon's amazing service.This has both wider and coarser teeth. I use wider for my beard and coarser for my mustache.These kinds are seamless and tend to have rounded tips that are great for massaging without the damaging little jagged edges that plastic combs have. They’re made from cellulose acetate, which is a plant-based ingredient rather than a petroleum (plastic) based material. They are also impact resistant and more durable than plastic (although some people do refer to it as ‘nature’s plastic’).

I've been using this for the last 18 years. Absolutely works. Hands down the best! An absolute must for hair, skin, lips, anywhere that need healthy, natural moisturizing. HAIR I use this product to soften and moisturize my natural hair. It works well in calming my itchy scalp. In the past buying hair grease I realized it was inevitable that I'd break out with acne but not with this one. I'm really happy with this product to date. I've use it for about 2 to 3 years now and it is my go to. It is the only one I use. I tried others and instant acne. But not with this one. Glad I found Nature's Blessings. Thank you.. Arrived unsealed and appears to have been sampled! Exchanging for another jar. Will post update when the replacement arrives!UPDATE!!! I received my replacement and everything looks great!!! I was sent this when I first went natural in the early 2000's.  Back when the original recipe actually had bits of herbs in it! We would order by the case, it was so good. They have since change the recipe but it still works good.  However, my hair really grew and was super healthy when using it with the original recipe.  I'm still a fan though! The smell is perfect, not too strong but very pleasant.  Try it! Makes my hair shiny and soft. Can be used on wet natural hair for a twist out of on dry hair. Will reorder for sure!",1,5,-4

This one seems hotter, but maybe it's just because my other one is old. This one lost a start because it has a loud whine to it that the other one never had. Otherwise, seems solid, light, and compact. I'm sure there are dryers that have more specialized features, but for me this is all I need. It's light weight, has 2 settings (high and low), great for traveling and storage since it is small. Very cost effective. This is the second one I've owned in several years. I'm sold. Perfect for travelingUsed it in France this summer I really like the compact size and that it folds into an even smaller shape. However, I don't like that you are bot supposed to wrap the cord around the dryer which leaves a long cord to contend with! Yes, you can put it in a loop with a twisty but it would be nice to have the cord retract into the dryer or provide an easy way to store it. I needed a travel dryer and read reviews for many online. I chose this one because people said it wasn't too loud. It dries my hair quickly and is actually quieter than my home dryer that is touted to be extra quiet. It even dried my poodle faster than my full size hair dryer! Great for travel , small and lightweight.",4,4,0

reviewer's comments you'll find the actual ingredients are chocked full of chemicals; ""Naturals"" seems to be a misnomer. I must admit I like this product anyway. It is an economical multi-purpose item. It smells great and is:+ an excellent shaving lotion, cheaper than most shaving gels.+ a good light conditioner+ a curl reviving mist when mixed with water in a spritzer: 1 part conditioner to 2 parts water and scrunching works for me+ a deep conditioner when mixed with your preferred oil (jojoba, almond, olive, coconut...), apply and wrap hair in warm towel TWICE or about 15 minutes+ a leave-in conditioner for ends only!+ a decent valueDownside of the product:- it's prone to build up and requires periodic use of clarifying shampoo.- needs to be alternated with another conditioner, I use Mane & Tail as well as Aussie 3 Minute Miracle.It's only 4 STARS because it's slight residue doesn't do well for me on hot humid Texas days; mixed with my scalp perspiration  it gives me the ""cooties"". Does better for me in the cooler weather.FYI: When co-washing a la the Wen System way make sure you wet your hair and scalp for about TWO minutes BEFORE you apply the conditioner. The water dissolves/removes other products and allows this to both work and rinse better. Definitely not the best quality but it is what was expected for the price. I did the whole no shampooing thing and tried this conditioner and it worked pretty well. The only thing I didn't like is that it didn't seem to be made for people with dandruff. My head started itching after a while. Overall though, great for people with normal hair. I just have a sensitive scalp. The ONLY conditioner I can use to get my hair manageable and easy to comb! It's a dream come true that this product works and it's less than $5!!  I have found it cheaper in the grocery stores, but when I need a bunch quickly and am working a lot, it's nice to buy on amazon and have it delivered. I'd have shaved my head by now if it weren't for this conditioner. Who would have guessed??? I am usually very picky about my shampoos and conditioners. I use Herbal Essence as my shampoo of choice, but I didn't really like their conditioners. I have tried many others, but I keep coming back to the Suave Coconut. I'm very sensitive to strong scents, but this coconut scent is light enough that it doesn't bother me, but heavy enough to remind me of the beach. I can't find this in the store very often anymore, so I'm glad i was able to find it on Amazon! Really makes my hair feel thick and beauiful Although I live in Australia, I just had to have this product.  After using it while holidaying in the US, I took some home with me.  When I ran out, I tried to find a comparable product locally but nothing was good enough.  In the end, I went online, thinking I might be able to order it from Walmart, but alas ... amazon.com to the rescue!I bought cases ... enough to last me for 5-10 years.Says it all I s'pose. I use this as a shaving cream, not as a hair conditioner. I've tried it on my hair and it left it sticky waxy rough and dry all at the same time. On my skin, however, for shaving, its divine. Smells SO good and I never nick myself when I use it. Doesn't clog up my razor either. Its much cheaper than the fancy shaving ""cremes"" out there and I think it works even better. Afterwards my legs feel super smooth and smell great. Definitely buy this in a drugstore if posisble, because it can usually be found for a few bucks. I love this conditioner and use it as a co-wash and conditioner for my thick, wavy hair. It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. You can't beat it for the price. I don't feel guilty about using massive quantities of it, which is the best part.",2,4,-2

I am one of those people who product hops constantly only using quarters of products then deciding I don't like it and buying something else (a huge waste of money), that is until I found this! I am currently purchasing my THIRD jar!I am mixed: black, white and native american, with very tight curls that turn into frizz if not properly taken care of, and I had done so much damage to my hair by over-straightening and over heating I lost my curls and ended up with 4 different curl patterns (it looked crazy). I just died my hair blonde-ish, did the big chop and have been working my way back from scratch. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It gives me so much moisture and leaves my hair soft and shiny and my curls springy. I use it as a conditioner almost on a daily basis (I use the silicon mix perla shampoo once or twice a week) and as an overnight leave in deep conditioner at least one to two times a week as well. My curls have come back in full force and my hair has grown at least 3 inches since this past November. I also really like the smell, it's very similar to rose water.I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any one with very curly hair, looking to somewhat tame and define it; as well as anyone looking to repair and regrow their hair. This gives my hair so much life and I can officially say it has made me a very happy and dedicated costumer :) Excellent as a regular conditioner and also as a leave in. Price is much better than what I’ve paid in discount stores. A must I'd have toSay I didint expect it to work as well as it did so I'm impressed but I'll also say I've had better working products like it's a ten it's the best for fortifying if that's what UR looking for but if not and u only have minimal hair damage not major likeMe than this would be a great product for u this product is very moisturizing and made my hair glossy it's usually kinda dry and we all kno dry hair isint easy to get glossy anywyz so after using this product for only a couple times (which by itself alone is impressive that it worked that quickly)it def helped my hair and there that's my review take with it what u want:) (btw I only gave this four stars cuz it wasn't as fortifying as id liked it to be since that's this products primary claim ...:P ...:) First things first, my hair type. I have straight mid back hair that is full and thin and a bit damaged. I first started using the fortifying hair treatment after a suggestion from a family friend. I love how it makes my hair super soft and it prevented my hair from frying at the tips. The smell is a bit strong but I like it so I don't mind it.This is a lot of product, so it will last you a while. I always leave it on for 15 minutes before washing it off. I also suggest buying the Leave in conditioner of the Silicon Mix Perla because it will help your hair feel smoother and softer. Upon opening the lid I was repulsed by the strong perfumie smell, but decided that I would try it nontheless. When I mixed this with Kanechom Goat Milk in a smaller bowl the scent was much less pungent and more soothing. I piled it on my head after shampooimg and when I rinsed it out I was met with unbelievably soft supple hair! I thought my hair could only feel this soft when moisture overloaded, but I was wrong. It feels soft but nice and supple, it isn't breaking at all. After I rollerset my hair it felt softer and silkier than ever before. I will say however that the smell does linger, so if you don't like that, just giving you a heads up, but I love it. It's very light and pleasant. Same formula that I has grown to become a staple in my haircare cabinet. Gentle, and effective.",4,5,-1

I used this on my synthetic wigs and it brought them all back to life! This stuff is a game changer! I won’t use another type again This is an okay wig spray. It smells good, but it doesn't untangle my wigs, which is why I purchased this. I can take it or leave it. I LOVE DEMERT'S Wig Luster Conditioning Spray. It gives me the light shine and movement that I need and want. The spray is not a heavy oil which is great. Plus the #1 thing is it's ability to detangle the hair right on the spot. It keeps it detangled and SUPER soft. You can run your fingers right thought it and it moves. That's EXTREMELY important. Test it after a couple days and the hair is still soft and manageable. Thank you to the owners and seller(s) of DEMERT'S Wig Luster Conditioning spray.  Sincerely,  Kimberly D. Ivy This product keeps my wigs looking great.Really helps get the tangles out of my longer wigs. I've been using this conditioning spray on my synthetic wigs for years and it works great.  What I like about this spray is that it is not heavy so it doesn't weigh the hair down.  I also like the coverage aerosol spray provides.  The aerosol allows for long sweeps across the hair making even coats.  Best of all, this spray makes the hair feel softer and gives it a beautiful natural shine and luster. Ive tried a few other ""conditioning"" sprays and they make the hair look oily and fake.I generally apply Demert every other day or as needed.  I also apply it after the hair has been shampooed and still slightly damp.  You really don't need to spray a lot to give your  but its great for bringing old units back to life.There's not really anything negative I can say that I've experienced with Demert wig luster conditioner.  I have not used it on human hair, so I can not attest to how it works in that scenario and as far as synthetics are concerned, it works great! This product works wonders! I use it for all my cosplay wigs and been using this since 2015. Makes it soft and have natural shine. Make sure to get the shampoo as well. First off, I tried this on a long, tangled Kanekalon wig and a long Halloween wig. I also tried it on an untangled Kanekalon wig and a Hannah Montana wig ($7 at wal-mart).PROS:It instantly made the hair easier to comb. The hair was softer and straighter afterwards. It smelled better too.CONS:It won't get rid of any huge tangles (>2in diameter) at the bottom of the wig, especially if the tangles look more like tumbleweeds. It'll only get rid of the tangle if it's not too big.A confused bee kept coming over when I was spraying this.VERDICT = It's great if you don't have any gigantic tangles. It makes the wig smoother and prettier. My advice is that you spray it on the wig the moment you get it out of the bag. That way, you can avoid any big tangles.",5,5,0

I began purchasing this in the store and then I couldn't find it so I immediately turned to Amazon. I received both my bottles and used it today. It is the best conditioner I have ever used. It detangles my hair in the shower while rinsing it out.I'm starting to become more familiar with ingredients.If you adore smooth hair you will look for products containing Dimethiconol and Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine.A lot of expensive shine and anti-frizz elixirs you find at Ulta contain these ingredients as well.Way to go DOVE you rock my world! Scent was a little disappointing as it does not smell like the body wash and shampoo. Barely any scent, really.  I hope Dove improves the scent because Green Tea and Cucumber is my favorite. I'm a fan of Dove，I love all their product with great quality and affordable price. But，I love this shampoo and conditioner more，I have been using this shampoo for years，and will never and ever change.If Amazon have shampoo and conditioner .I will purchase from there all the Time.It's so hard to find in N Y C，if I found somewhere ,here will be far away from my apartment.So Heavy to carry it home I have been using this for a while now and I really love it. I have very thick curly hair and it’s course. Every morning I have to wet my head and I apply the conditioner and I just leave in all day and take out next day and put new. I love the smell and it seems to work for me. Makes my hair softer and keeps the curls in. Love this, I have extremely thin, damaged, corse, curly hair... This stuff smells good and definitely makes my hair softer than any other store bought conditioners I've tried I’ve always run out of conditioner so I bought this, I totally think this is a great buy it’s also a good deal Dove Cool Moisturizer conditioner has been my favorite since I discovered it may years ago. At times I have found it challenging to find in store and was very happy to find it on Amazon! This smells amazing, keeps my hair smooth, but not greasy! Works wonderfully, and will continue to purchase for as long as it is available! Smells beyond good, go for it",1,5,-4

I had started seeing some bald spots and my stylist recommended this product. I have been using it for the year and finding it only on Amazon.  It provides a deep cleaning that remove all the dirt, oil, and biildup and very moisterurizing. I just wash my hair and my curl pattern falls in place because my hair is so soft from using the product.It provided a fuller healthier hair no more bald spots.  It has expand my hair to produce fat, healthy and stronger hair that have been growing.  This is my go to product line. I love it. UPDATE:  Almost five months and no change either way.  I think I've reached my zenith.UPDATE:  It has been over two months now.  My hair is receding more around the crown than it did before I used this shampoo.  There is no way to prove it has had any positive or negative effect on my scalp.  I am giving it back to 3-stars, as everyone's chemistry is different.  I can only say that it was at most, a neutral product for hair loss.I shopped around a lot for a DHT blocker shampoo that had no chemicals - all natural.  This is the only one I found that wasn't crazy expensive.  For nine dollars and (8) eight ounces, I thought it wasn't too bad even if it didn't work.  But (8) eight ounces goes a long way, as I only need about a dime's worth to make it lather.It's been about a month and I only let it sit for about two minutes.  After completely rinsing, I add Right now am giving it a star because of the comments,  Am afraid to use it. it's not even in the original container an it doesn't smell the same.  Don't get me wrong this product has had done wonders to my hair.  When I get the nerve to use it, I will give a full review  To my surprise this stuff really works. So happy, no longer a skeptic. I have been using the entire Groganics hair system for about 3 weeks & I'm amazed!  My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding & not much at all!  My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, & I have a lot of new growth ( I haven't measured yet, I'm going to wait about 2 months).  The ""freeze"" shampoos & conditioner also works wonders & leaves your hair SOFT!  Using the Groganics system on a daily basis produces the best results!  I wash & deep condition my hair twice a week as some of the daily hair products are a bit oily, however they do show RESULTS!  I also use the vitamins, but I only take one a day as my hair does grow rapidly; it was just thin & I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out & have healthy ends, etc...  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics! I used it for two months until today. Hair obviously does not regrow instantly. However, Hair fall Stopped. I see some young hair sprouting out over some parts of my head, however, I will still have to see if it grows back in the part where I lost hair the most. As of today, it works satisfactorily. It has saw palmetto which really works well for hair growth<from various sources over internet>. Right after 3-4 usages, I noticed that hair fall reduced. I did not see any reaction over my head or hair. So, at least for me, it was totally safe to use. I also noticed thickening of hair- although not drastic, hair became thicker than previous. i was using the original Groganics it was ding good and decided to try the HDT growth formula i Love it my hair looks and feels fuller and more manageable My hair has been thinning and it is looking much better with the new formula i willuse again it’s awesome. The peppermint smell is a plus also ♥️Love itLinda Winters I love this product! From the first day I used it I've seen fantastic results. I have really thin hair and in conjunction with the other groganic products I'm using; I'm seeing great results. I use the shampoo and the feather light volumizing conditioner, which seems to really complement each other nicely. The only complaint I have to make about them is that both the conditioner and the shampoo bottles are really small, so if you have really long hair, you might want to buy two of each or else you will run out of it in a week. this product performs as promised. My sisterlockologist uses it on my hair and we're BOTH pleased!",1,5,-4

Same as the conditioner. I still got a good amount left though and it's pretty good and it smells pretty nice. I used the conditioner, for African American Natural Hair, by Just Natural on today. I was pleased with this conditioner,because it was  very moisturizing even after I rinsed it out. I used the conditioner, along with olive oil as a co-wash ,it had great slip to it. I was able to comb my hair out well with it. I have 4c hair with a mixture of 4b hair and it took no time to comb out my hair. I have tried Shea Moisture Deep Masque, but was not pleased with it as a deep Conditioner, I use it as a leave in conditioner. I will be using this conditioner for now and I may try some of there other products. The only problem I have with this product, is the price, its a little high. I will purchase again.******Update******* I had to stop using this conditioner, it was making my scalp itch sooooooooooooooo bad. At first I thought it was  the Shea moisture retension shampoo that I was using along with the conditioner. So I decided to do a co-wash  with the African American Conditioner for natural hair. And it happened again after one day my, scalp was itching sooooo bad I had to rewash it again. Once I shampoo my hair,the itching stop. I must be allergic to something in the conditioner. And it's a shame because it really does work well for my hair. When using the conditioner it didn't leave my hair as soft or replenished as it promised. I've used cheaper conditioners that worked better. This is not a terribly bad product it's just that the cost just isn't worth it. This along with the shampoo did wonders for my hair it made it solf and manageable. Which is always a struggle for us natural sistas lol. It okay. The reviews made it seem like this stuff was the best thing since sliced bread. It was ""ok"". I actually felt like I had to use other conditioners to supplement it. I have been using this Conditioner and the Shampoo since February of this year. At first, the price was a major issue, but when I came across some extra funds I decided to splurge.What I love most about this product is that it REALLY is all natural and works extremely well on my natural 4a/4b hair. I wash my hair at least twice a week (once with conditioner only) and I never have to worry about the ingredients in these products irritating my scalp or drying out my hair.After being natural for 5 years I am still experimenting with different products here and there, but I am pretty much settled on this conditioner as a part of my regular hair care routine.Oh and one last thing! A little goes a long way so although a little pricey, it does last for a few months. Great product, will definately repurchase I reviewed the shampoo first, and now I'm ready for the conditioner. I love it. My hair likes these products and has stopped fighting me now.  My hair and I are getting along well and we are in a very good place now thanks to these products.  It's been about six months or so and now I'm buying the detangler too. I was using the conditoner as a detangler but as my hair is growing I need a little more in that area.The shampoo and conditioner combo work very well together. Buy them.",1,4,-3

I bought this as a trial and was so thrilled with the results, I've ordered a bunch to have on hand.  I am a redhead, in fact 2 grandparents, both parents and all 3 of us kids are redheads, so WE KNOW REAL AUBURN COLOR.  As we redheads age it is difficult to find a dye to match the faded and/or white areas with the still auburn hair.  Most  dyes are so phony that I wouldn't use them.  I do use a product I like but I bought this just for the in-between times when the roots need a little something.  The product blended beautifully with the other dye I use and looks totally natural.  Now I can extend the time between complete dyes of my long hair and still not have to don a hat!HATS OFF to Clairol for this easy to use product that works better than any of my dreams. Quick, easy root cover up to get me through until my next hair appointment.  Although my hair is a unique color, this dye blends in nicely and no one can tell I completed my touch-ups on my own.  It only takes about ten minutes to apply and easily washes out in the shower.  This has been much easier to use than other DIY dyes I have used. This was an easy kit to use, and it covered my roots and gray in only 10 minutes! Matched up nicely. Great for a quick touch up so I don’t have to color as often. Extended my color an extra 3-4 weeks. I've tried many of these touch ups.  For me they only last about 3-4 days and then my hair needs to be colored the regular way.  It says 'permanent' but that isn't the case for me.  This is only good in a pinch but I'd prefer to just take the time out and color my hair as usual. I like this brand for root touch-ups mainly for the gray hair I get around my hairline. Great for in between salon visits, but these do seem to leave a reddish/gold tint in my blond hair. But I guess that's better than gray until I get to the salon. This product delivers what it claims, is easy to use and saves me a bundle.  I now only have to pay for 1/2 to 1/3 the number of salon colorings depending upon whether I use this product 1ce or 2ce between.  Lasts about 4-6 weeks (which is a really long time for my color - red, because red fades the most of any color I am told.)",2,2,0

The subtle fragrance is lovely. The Aveda scent brings back memories of the 90s. I was looking for a non drying volumizing shampoo and this brand popped into my mind. The shampoo works very well and does not appear to dry my hair out. I bought the smaller size - will probably purchase again. Hair feels and looks fuller without drying out your hair. Not as good as my WOW shampoo. I love the product. But it leaked everywhere inside the package :/ They need to tighten and tape top prior to mailing.

The tines don't catch on everything in your pocket since they are folded into the housing.I used to carry a regular comb for a while. The problem was that the tines would catch on everything. So I went looking for one that folded. I decided to get this one.The pocket clip works well enough when it's new, but that will fade when the rivet starts to wear in. Eventually you will need to use a little bit of CA glue to prevent it from turning. If you're careful it won't take away from the aesthetics much. (You may even want to do that before it becomes a problem.)The comb is a bit stiff to open and close at first, so it is easier to open two handed. Once it's worn in a bit it will get easier to open and close.I will say that this is not a comb that you will hand down to your children or grand children. It is also not a comb that is absolutely hassle-free. The rivet hinge is the main detriment.I liked it enough to buy a second one when I lost my first one though. This comb does what I need it to do. A lightweight and compact comb that I can slip in my pocket. It’s small and thin enough that it isn’t noticeable at all. Just the small pocket clip is all that can be seen. It is definitely suited more for shorter beards around an inch or two long. The teeth of the comb are not long enough to get deep into longer beards to comb them fully. Very nice, but not as fine tooth as I thought it would be Ive only had it for a short time, but so far I am very happy. If you have a shorter beard then this works great! At the time of purchase my beard was a bit longer than normal and I found the teeth on this to be too short to get through all of it. I have since trimmed it and this works great now. My husband really loves this comb. Absolutely love this. I keep one in my back pocket all the time - might need a second to keep in my work backpack as a backup I wasn’t aware a comb could be made at such a higher quality level above others!",2,3,-1

False advertising! Seems cheap. Bristles are wire with plastic on tips.Handle small for a small woman's hand. Would rate more for a travel brush due to size, will not use for everyday.  Somewhat disappointed in my purchase. Just received so durability remains to be determined. I have been using this hairbrush model for more than 8 years now, and it is now the only hairbrush I will ever buy.  Unlike many plastic bristle brushes that I have seen, this model's bristles are narrow and well-spaced, allowing for greater flexibility of the bristle during the stroke.  The cushioned pad that holds the bristles in place facilitates extra flexing from the base of the bristle.  The result is a hairbrush that is gentle yet effective on tangles, pulls out less hair, breaks fewer strands, and feels massage-like on the scalp.  My hair is very fine and particularly susceptible to being pulled out from the scalp, and this hairbrush has mitigated much angst.I find that these hairbrushes last 4 to 5 years if used at home.  Toting around in the purse puts pressure on the bristles so that they pop into the cushion earlier, shortening the effective lifespan of the brush to 1 to 3 years.  There is a related model, Light Touch #2, which is smaller for greater portability, but I have never purchased that model.Having not located this model in stores for the last 5 years or so, I have found it most economical to purchase 3 or 4 at a time from online retailers.  This way I can replace the one in my purse, the one at home, and still have extras on hand.To care for the hairbrush, use your hand to remove extraneous hair on a daily or weekly basis.  You may find that dust and lint collect at the base of the bristle where there is an extra little piece of bristle plastic to secure the bristle in place.  Fingernails can pluck out this lint on a monthly or semi-annual schedule.  I find it generally unnecessary to wash this model of brush (since I do not use hair products such as wax, foam, mousse, or gel), but it certainly doesn't hurt. This brush is imported from FranceMy niece sent my 1st one 30 years ago it's a brush for Angel's from from heaven  ! I have had this brush for 15 years, it's been my all time favorite. Over time I looked and looked for another just in case I lost it, but never have found another until I saw it here on Amazon. ThIs brush has held up for YEARS! The bristles still have all the little round tips, not a single one missing. A few bristles are bent but considering the thousands of times I've used it and thrown it into this bag or that purse, that's pretty amazing. It's gone through lots of abuse and the handle has not broken even though it's made of a type of solid hard plastic material. The rubber part the bristles are embedded in is still pliable and not cracked or broken which has happened to other brushes similar to this I've had in the past. The tips of the bristles are such that they do not scratch your head and they feel good! It's probably not recommended, but I wash it in the dishwasher every so often... This has not degraded the rubber or made the tips come off, obviously. I saw it here on Amazon and bought three more because I'm afraid they will stop making it someday plus was so thrilled to have found it again. The new ones are just the same as my original and don't appear to be made cheaper like so many others things end up being made these days. The only comparable brush I'd found in the mean time was the Wet Brush which is cheaper and comes in fun colors, but I don't know how that one will hold up over time. I have used the Touch 1 and 2 brushes for more than 20 years. The bristle tips are very easy on the scalp with thin hair. Good for dryer styling as well. I suppose they would be great for thick-haired people as well. Had my sights on a much pricier brush but bought this one in a moment of financial clarity...good brush and feels great in my all one length super thick almost waist length hair.  My hair is so thick I can only get a normal pony tail holder around it twice comfortably, three times if I'm willing to possibly break it trying.  This brush rarely catches or snags and feels great on my scalp. Works much better if you keep excess build up of loose hair and lint cleaned out of it.I carried it with me in my purse for awhile and some of the bristles bent and I can't get them straightened out so I wouldn't recommend doing that.The handle has a great grip that feels comfortable to hold.  Didn't give it 5 stars because I felt like the bristles shouldn't have bent so easily but that may be too high of an expectation for being in a purse with just sunglasses case and wallet? Wouldn't be an issue for someone who just leaves it at home on the vanity because the bristles don't show any wear or tear from just normal use and brushing. Good product and I'm very happy overall. A simple little hairbrush, but just read all of the glowing reviews.  I have had this brush for over 15 years, and it finally started to show it's age. My girlfriend laughed at me and my devotion to this old brush, until one day she couldn't find hers and used my Phillips. She understood immediately why I refused to replace it, and I ended up having to share my brush from that point on.I have curly hair, and she has long straight hair, but this brush, unlike every other brush I've ever tried, somehow can detangle both my curly hair and her straight hair with ease. It's not too stiff, not to soft, somehow just right. It brushes my hair and detangles it without pain and pulling.It really sounds like such a simple thing, but for me this brush is on the short list of little things in life that bring me pleasure and make my life easier. :)I finally broke down and hunted online for a new Phillips to replace my old one, and found them here on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Enough that I bought TWO of them. One for me, and one for my girlfriend. I still haven't had the heart to throw out my old Phillips (it works fine, even though rather worn at this point). And the new ones are just as good as the old one :)  If you need a good brush that can detangle, give this a shot :)",1,2,-1

It works well on baby hairs and doesn’t seem to pull my hair and applies very nicely. It lends itself to a bit of a wet look on me but I like that. My boyfriend has shoulder length 2A hair and it works very well on him, just on the temples, for keeping his hair out of his face and looking neat with just a light combing through. The product does not smell like lavender to me, it smells like and reminds me of glue. The first container I received had a missing plastic portion on the bottom so I returned it. I think it was used. The second one I received was intact. Yes, it is much cleaner than globbing gel on your hands to run through your hair, however this product just won’t give you the best slicked back look solely on its own. It’s best paired with the globbing of the gel. It is however good for fly aways or smaller pieces of hair that needs to be tucked away, but not for large amounts of hair on it’s own. ALSO — no one talks about how gross it gets, collects hair and you have to pull it off. + it falls out of the tube a lot for me!BASICALLY—I don’t think this product is absolutely necessary for you to achieve your slicked back looks This makes my life easier with how practical this is. Pretty much is gel on a stick, so far, my experience it does not leave white residue on hair and once applied it dries fast. It can be used for boy-girl hair and it fits in a handbag so great for any retouch. This is great for your hair, I have some wild chin hair and a few swipes of this and a comb hold my beard hair in place all day with a nice pleasant smell better than any beard balm out there and the best part you don’t have to get your hands sticky to use it! We used this for pulling back my daughters hair for softball. She has a lot of baby hairs. Works great just make sure you want to wear your hair pulled back because it does leave it feeling greasy. I felt like I was ahead of everyone as far as wild messy hair look back in 2002. I can still pull it off once in a while, it’s just nice to know that I can still have my bed head stick, if anything for nostalgia.  Haha This product is amazing! I am such a fan of a sleek slick back and this product not only holds everything in place but keep its shiny and glides evenly. You will not be disappointed! Like the product.  It really works!",5,4,1

(Packaging May Vary)","It works I like that it's not overly sudsy nice sent rinses out clean and quickly good price I will continue to use this product I like that it doesn't have conditioners or oils in the shampoo I have oily hair so I like that the shampoo doesn't contain oils just good shampoo I have been using these for a while and I like the result.So I thought to order some more. I was happy to order both the shampoo and the conditioner.The conditioner came wrapped in plastic but this order of shampoo came without the plastic protection.So one of the shampoo actually leaked. Very disappointing. (Conditioner package had air protection as well and so no leakage at all)Amazon hopefully will take the quality control more seriously from now on...as I am hoping to keep ordering this product. This and the matching conditioner really are fantastic products at any price. Bonus they’re reasonably priced and natural. My fine thin hair is noticeably thicker, softer, stronger. Very happy with these products and have shared with my mom, who’s the same but more at 70!I enjoyed the castor oil hair masque from Shea Moisture as a daily conditioner for several winters (in a very harsh MN climate) but I’ve come to prefer these products instead.They WORK! Jason is a great brand. I purchased this item because I was told it would help reduce hair loss.  I have used one container.  I like it and have ordered another bottle.  I also take product with Biotin in it.  I am not sure which one is doing it or maybe it is a combination of both but, I am not losing hair like it did before I started using these products. I had falling and brittle hair and tried many shampoos including Jason. But eventually I have come back to this SLS-free shampoo because it suits me the best. It has noticeably reduced my hair fall and leaves my hair moisturized, but not weighted down, after washing. I also like the fact that it has no scent and lathers up very nicely, proving how dispensible SLS really is! And a little goes a long way, so it is economical for me as well. For all these reasons I am giving it five stars. All with product all good , but with the delivery Very disappointed, everything was open, spilled full of shampoo in the package and out.I not get full shampo only half… Aloe Vera Shampoo and Conditioner - I am one of those people who research products obsessively before buying them. I have recently been on the hunt for a natural/non toxic shampoo and conditioner that doesnt cost a fortune. I landed on Jason's. Many ""natural"" or ""plant based"" shampoos still contain ingredients that harmful to your health or to the water supply and the few I found that dont see to cost $25+ dollars and that's just not in my budget. And as far as the products themselves go, my hair has literally not felt this good since I was a kid. The shampoo alone does leave it pretty dry, but it isnt like a damaged kind of dry, it just feels like it cleaned it super well. I definitely wouldnt use it without the conditioner though. But the conditioner is magnificent and leaves my hair incredibly soft and not weighed down at all. For real, my hair had so much more volume after using these and seems to get softer and fuller everytime I wash. I have big soft natural curls that usually look super dry and lifeless but since switching to these they are soft and shiny and bouncy and I couldnt be more pleased. The shampoo is a bit hard to lather in but as long as you wet it really well you can make a little go a long way. It doesnt have much of a scent to it at all which is fine by me. Will definitely be buying again. Bought as a gift for my thirteen year old niece. She likes it very much.",5,4,1

I have been using Alterna Caviar AntiAging Volume Shampoo with Seasilk for years. The product pictured as well as the description are misrepresentative as the product I received is a different version - I received Alterna Caviar AntiAging Bodybuilding Volume shampoo which gives completely different results.I scrutinized the picture and description before placing my order to be certain it was the correct formula. The product in the picture is the product I wanted, has a silver cap and lettering CAVIAR runs vertically on the bottle. Bottle is a light shade of purple/lilac.Fast forward: Product I received has cap the same lilac color as bottle, lettering runs horizontally, and the wording on the front is Caviar Bodybuilding Volume. Bottle color is also darker shade of purple/lilac.Bottom line: a different formula than what is described was sent. It does not moisturize nor overall perform at the level of the Caviar AntiAging Volume Shampoo with Seasilk.This can be tricky as at cursory glance, products look similar, but beware when you see the word BODYBUILDING, know it is not the same as the AntiAging Volume formula. The Bodybuilding formula, at least on my fine, tinted hair, does not moisturize nor deliver the overall benefits as AntiAging Volume Shampoo with Seasillk.I contacted Amazon and they understood the issue. Now, the vendor needs to make this right on the website.Link to: Alterna Caviar Antiaging Volume Shampoo with Seasilk Seriously, this is one of my favorite ""luxury"" products. I bought this on a whim at the recommendation of a Sephora employee and have been in love with it from day one. I found that my hair had become less porous in texture in the last couple of years and the amount of strands lost in the shower was drastically increasing. This shouldn't be a surprise to a male as one ages but as someone who has literally no baldness in his family I was a little worried. I wanted to start washing my hair with sulfate-free products only. This was my first sulfate-free shampoo splurge and I am so glad I went for it!This shampoo is amazing. It has definitely amped up the volume in my hair and has given my strands a little more life and density. I like that this literally volumizes on it's own. No other products are needed. I don't even need the conditioner (which I actually DO own and only use about once ever two weeks) to add volume. This shampoo moisturizes and strengthens my fine strands. I love the scent too. It smells amazing!! Now, I can't complain about the price since I only need to use a tiny dime size amount each wash but I can see how this bottle might be small for women with a ton of hair to work with but this seriously lathers up AMAZINGLY for a sulfate free product.I love this shampoo!!! I can't rave enough about it! I just bought the Caviar Moisture shampoo as well as the Bamboo Volumizing Shampoo and I love them both! This is my go-to though!! Definitely worth a try. I would at least go to your local sephora and request a sample! Alterna is fabulous!! I bought this product because of the other positive reviews on it, but am very disappointed at the very strong, perfumey scent it has.  I have only used it once and cannot tell if it has had any effect on my hair as it does not seem any different than when I have used other shampoos, but the smell is so strong and offensive to me (and my sinuses have been very uncomfortable) that I don't think I will be able to continue to use it.  I assumed that since it said it did not have so many chemicals in it that the scent would be a light, natural, not terribly noticeable one, but I was wrong.  It has an awful lot of ingredients in it and, although it says it has no Phthalates, it is my understanding that if it says it has fragrance in it and a fragrance this strong, it comes from Phthalates.  This might be a great shampoo if it were unscented or came in unscented or if they just toned the scent down and made it less perfumey smelling..  I definitely would not recommend it to anyone with the slightest sensitivity to scented products. The product's bottle is not the same as the picture one. The first time I ordered I thought I ordered the wrong product. But this is the second time I am ordering this product and I am not getting the same bottle as the picture. The one they sent is a plastic bottle without the silver top. I am not sure if they are the same. Not happy with my order. I really, really wanted this shampoo to work. I have short, fine, color-treated hair, and I try to keep the color lasting as long as possible. My styling routine is just letting my hair air-dry. I used this shampoo for about a month. The smell was nice, and a little bit would go a long way. However, my color did not last very well while using this shampoo, and it even seemed to dry my hair out. I've never had problems with tangles, but this seemed to encourage them!Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I won't be purchasing this again. My hair use to be dry and brittle- effects of pregnancy- and I tried Alterna from a sample given to me. I was hesitant at first, due to price and that Asian hair (texture) is different from the rest of the worlds' but I love how it works solo or with the conditioner as well. Smells great too! Leaves my hair silk soft and shinny. Tried lots of expensive shampoos in the market but this really moisturized my stressed out hair. Great shampoo!",2,1,1

These are light weight and don't hurt my fingers to use, and no more hair pulling for my husband. I like 'em, but I am not an expert. I was a little disappointed. They weren't as sharp as I had anticipated. Not a hair designer, just use for trimming in between professional cuts.  Very sharp and easy to use. These haircutting shears are far from sharp. It's like buying scissors from the Dollar store. These scissors are unbelievably precise and SHARP.  They are comfortable in your hand.  I had another pair of Fromm for the past 20 years and they still are not bad and I have never had anything done to them.  I cut my own hair which has ranged from middle of my back to shoulder length.  These are the best! Super sharp. Very light. Exceptional value for the money. Total mismatch between product photos and real items. Totally wrong specification. Returned to Amazon for a Refund. I bought these shears to clip my ends and they work very well. I trim my hair in small sections so I don't know how they would perform with a thick portion of hair but they work for me. Made in Germany.",2,3,-1

Work it through the hair, rinse and wrap your head in a towel for few minutes, then comb out wet hair with ease. I was worried that by going with the waterfall mist shampoo AND the waterfall mist conditioner I would be over-doing the waterfall and/or mist for my hair.WOW. I WAS WRONG.  If I could swear I would.  Between these guys and the shower head, it literally feels like I am in a waterfall when I shower.  Then, I'm thinking, okay, the waterfall branding exceeded my wildest dreams, but where is the mist?.  Then, you step out of the shower and BAM! mist. all over the place.  It's a delayed action type thing.Equal parts waterfall and mist, so if you are looking for a different combination, or you are looking for simultaneous waterfall and mist, look elsewhere, as the mist action is quite delayed in regards to the waterfall action. First of all i love the smell of this conditioner. My hair is way off my shoulders so can only speak to how it works on short hair which is great. I have been using this product for 2 years and could find it in my local stores anymore. Glad I found it on Amazon This conditioner makes my hair feels soft and it even makes my hair appear healthier. The shape of the bottle also is nice because it's easy to hold onto and the cap is easy to open when your hands are wet.The only negative thing that I would say is the scent is too weak. I like the scent, but it just needs to be stronger for me to 100% enjoy this product.Overall, good product for the price, but I would love a stronger scent. Got this 'cause I needed a sulfate free conditioner for my dreadlocks - rinses out with no residue and leaves hair feeling soft and more moisturized than before. Will order again. No complaints about the product at all, same stuff you can buy at the store.  I didn't realize this was such a small bottle, though.  I usually get the ""family size"" so I was surprised when I received a bottle about half that size.  Price is a little high compared to buying in store. It's conditioner, how bad could it be? It rinses clean with no residue. Sent is ok and lasts a fairly long time. Can't beat the great price, smell, and amount you get with each bottle. It states natural as well (don't know how natural) so it should be better.",5,4,1

The towel is good quality and soaks up water, but it's too short to hold all my hair. I would LOVE it if it were just longer, but it's very good quality.  I was gifted an Aquis towel over 30 years ago and I thought it was a weird thing... but then I tried it!  I have bought several more over the years (for myself and others) and I use them every time I wash my hair.  I bring one with me when I travel because I now hate using any other type of towel to dry my hair AND I still have the original towel that is over 30 years old - it has held up (although no longer bright white from going in the dryer countless times) and it still works.  I love the waffle weave even more than the original - but I still love my original towel.  I highly recommend!!! I have VERY THICK LONG HAIR.  I cannot wash my hair without a hair towel.  I have 3 very hyper active boys and zero time for myself.  Blow drying is a luxury I do not have.  So this is better than a regular towel. I wear my hair in this towel for 15 min after my shower.  In years past I drove to work with my hair wrapped up in a similar hair towel so my shirt didn’t get wet.I’d like this towel more if it was wider for longer hair.  My hair is to my but.  I’m 5’5”Again, I couldn’t wash my hair if I didn’t have a hair towel. I'm one of those nuts who likes to drive a clean car -- I wash my vehicles every 1-2 weeks. I had a car drying towel from Meguiar's which was supposed to be absorbent, but it was just OK. Someone reviewed that product and recommended using this towel instead, and all I can say is WOW, what an improvement. Sure it costs 3x as much, but I'm getting 4x the performance, so I'm coming out ahead. Well, not really. My wife saw I bought this for my car-washing habit, and she was a little put out that I bought this for drying cars and not for her, so I had to buy a second one for my wife. I bought it in a different color so that I wouldn't mix the two. She is happy with this to dry her hair. I'm happy with the way this works for drying cars. If you buy this, I can guarantee that you will be happy too. Why are you still reading this? Add it to your cart and buy it already. This is the third towel I've bought over the years - I left the last one behind where I stayed on vacation.  I don't like to be without one of these. Was given as a gift and they love it I used to use a version of this that had a little slot in the back to hook the tip after wrapping your hair. I was not sure about this b/c the prior ones i used were like a pocket style that stored the hair. This one is more like a normal towel shape.  I ended up liking this on much more. While it does NOT have a hook in the back, the wrapped end fits easily in the towel at the base of the scalp/neck and does in fact stay. My hair is to my waist so I did not think it would hold all of my hair but it DOES. it also works much better than the other brand I was using. it has a much better absorbency and dries quickly when hung back up on the hook for the next use.  love this.  I also think this would make good gift especially for one headed to college, etc.",5,3,2

magical brush that just takes out the tangles but it does help. I spray a little detangler in my daughter's hair and work from the bottom to the top. She loves it. Does not have as much pain brushing her hair with this. I have to go through her hair with a regular brush after because the prongs on this one are so far apart but that's not a big deal. Money well spent. No sele puede hacer fuerza para desenredar tenle pasiencia hay nudo que no van a desenredar usa un peine normal nota solo desenreda no peina por eso notarás algunos problemas para que tu pelo quede totalmente manejable pero funciona en un 85% My 5 year old granddaughter with shoulder blade length wavy hair gets terrible tangles several times a day, resulting at times In tears trying to brush it out. This device really works, smoothly and quickly with NO tears. Sent her home with it.. I’m on here ordering another to keep here.It would be an improvement to make this rechargeable. I have a feeling it will eat thru the two AA batteries fairly quickly. The product works well. I have used it for conditioned straight, long, and fine hair that can tangle easily. This has been working by just combing straight down. The screwdriver needed to put in the batteries is not one that a person usually would have on hand. It makes no sense to exclude one with the product if it is necessary to put in the batteries with it. I took the detangler to the hardware store to find and purchase the right screwdriver. I had a horde of old rechargeable Remington rechargeable detanglers that had more power than this one powered with small batteries, they were not always safe for kids, as it was not a good idea to recharge them in the bathroom lest they fall or get knocked over in the water. I have 4C (that means afro) hair.  This thing works!  It works on my tangled hair. I'm shocked.  I doubt it will untangle my hair if I let it get matted, but it works surprisingly well!  I'm going to get an extra one.  If you or your child are tender-headed, do yourself a favor and get one! While I can understand this working for people with coarse strands of hair, it doesn’t work for those with thin strands. I have a lot of hair but thin pieces of it so when I would use it, it would honestly just make it more tangled. We purchased this detangler because we had tried everything else on my toddler daughter.  She has very thin, dry, tangly hair and everything else I have tried ends up hurting.  This is so easy to use and helps make the detangling a lot easier.  It's not a magic tool but it is the best tool for the least amount of pain. I'm half black half white so after washing my hair,  and not brushing it for a couple of days.  My hair is tangled/nappy/hard to brush through.  I put the batteries in and Viola it works! IT WORKS!!! Slowly but surely. I LOVE IT!!!!",3,4,-1

Since bleaching my hair, this has been my go-to. I use this conditioner regularly, paired up with my purple toning shampoo. Definitely has an artificial fruity-pebbles smell, but not gross and doesn't linger after drying. Reminds me of the extra-rich conditioner tubes you get with box dyes, to help nourish your hair directly after you dye it at home. I always thought it would be nice to be able to just use that stuff all the time, and now, here's some wish-fulfillment. Would buy again, especially in a bargain two pack like this. So good! Really affordable protein conditioner for my fine, curly, highlighted hair. Would highly recommend for anyone with color treated (blonde) hair, particularly fine curly hair. This product really is a deeeeep conditioner. It is so THICK! I love this! The smell is heavenly. It almost smells like banana/coconut.. Something tropical anyway.. I love it! It makes my over processed hair so soft and lustrous again! If you are looking for pretty packaging though, the caps of each bottle come taped up, and when the taped comes off the text on the bottle comes off with the tape. I would imagine the same thing happening if it was left in a shower though. I purchased six bottles all at the same time and all of them were this way. I don't mind too much though because the product is great. I've been using this for at least 15 years, which is the same amount of time I've been bleaching my hair. I've always received compliments about how healthy and soft my hair is, despite bleaching it every couple of months for a decade and a half. I definitely think that using the Reconstructor 3 times per week (plus a specific conditioner the other days) has kept my hair from becoming dry and brittle over the years. Great as a deep conditioner or for everyday use. My hair was damaged from bleaching and not using the correct products and even though I still have split ends this makes it looks so much smoother and feel healthier. As soon as I get my hair cut I plan on continuing to use this conditioner and am confident that it will keep it in much better shape than my old regimen. Plus, it smells great and isn't too heavy on the hair. I'll keep this review simple. Right off the bat I noticed that this conditioner was the thickest consistency I had seen, not watered down at all. I don't dye my hair but I was on the lookout for a super rich deep conditioner to revive my dry summer straw hair. The smell is appealing, like bananas kind of? And within minutes it was like I had someone else's hair! I have tried tons of different conditioners but I will never look again because my hair has never been softer healthier or shinier than with this product! This is one of the best products I've ever used on my fine, chemically treated hair! I've tried many...Bed Head Dumb Blonde leaves my hair smooth, with less split ends developing. My hair looks and feels heathier between visits to the salon. This is the best price I've found, and it arrived much earlier than the estimated arrival. :-) I put some in my hair after washing, then rinse it out, then put a little more on and leave it in. Makes for easy combing.",1,4,-3

It leaves my hair so soft, clean, and very manageable.  I will definitely purchase it again, but it won't be for a long time because this bottle is huge!  I think this bottle will last me at least a year so it was worth the price to me.  Oh yeah, and the light fresh scent it leaves behind is great too!  I would recommend this product to anyone! This is a quality made hair conditioner made for dried out hair. The Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner comes in 1.3 litter / 44 Fl Oz large bottle with pump. The bottle size may be an issue if you don't have a proper shelf in your shower to place this on. Upon using this product for the first time, I was impressed with the salon-quality conditioner at the fraction of the cost. Yes, I do believe the this is not the orginal formula than it was years ago but I do not have an older bottle to compare it to either. This may not be a bad thing, since manufactures tend to upgrade their formulas to get away from harmful ingredients but I can not confirm this about this product, that's just my opinion. The smell is a bit different but again could be due to the ingredients used. The texture and feel of the hair conditioner is thick yet silky. You would only need a dime size to use in waist length hair, a little goes a long way! I don't use this myself basically because i do not like the smell. HOWEVER! My sister-in-law who lives in the Netherlands has me send her 5 bottles yearly. She has very tight curly beautiful hair and it is the only conditioner that keeps it in check. It is now easier than ever to send it overseas from the US, so I no longer have to have it send to my house and then package it up.  It was delivered within 2 days directly to her from the US. Very happy about that. Wife wrote:  Once again we as consumers are at the mercy of corporations.  This is the best conditioner out there.  The ultimate moisture brand, not the caviar brand.  I recently bought the caviar brand replenishing unknowingly.  As a long term user of ultimate moisture.  After a week, I noticed my hair became dry and first off a chemical odor  when using the caviar shampoo and conditioner.  I also noted I had a rash on my face and my scalp itched.  Odd I thought until I realized nexxus had changed the formula and discontinued ultimate moisture.  Did not notice a new and improved formula or anything on the bottle?  Shame on nexxus for giving in!!  They had developed a great product ""ultimate moisture"".  Caviar obviously does not have honey, coconut oil, or vitamin E only some chemical formula.  Cheap!  Very disappointed!  Now on a search for a similar ultimate moisture shampoo and conditioner as these will eventually be gone! This is an incredible hair product and the only conditioner that my family purchases.  The company produces an excellent shampoo as well.  Many shampoos on the market have a high ph content and are detergent and strip natural oils from hair.  Nexxus  Humectress works well for all types of hair, if you use it carefully, and do not overload your hair with it.  I apply a small amount  only to the ends of my hair as this is where hair can become dry from using a hair dryer and or curling iron.  Rinse hair well.  Enough remains in your hair to make your  hair feel well conditioned.  We most often buy this large size bottle and it lasts a long time, but it comes in smaller tubes that better fit in luggage  for a trip. After trying to purchase this product from other big names online- 4 times--I was ready to give up. Even though they advertised for"" ultimate moisturizing conditioner"" they always sent either the ""Cavier"" or the "" replenishing"" conditioner. I hate them both. So, I thought, ok, one more time. I ordered from Amazon and received my order in 2 days. ( so I paid an extra 3.50 to get in 2 days) I held my breath. FINALLY, I received the correct one. Naturally, I tried it right away to make sure it was as I remembered and loved so much. YES!!!! It IS the Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner. I absolutely love it. It makes your hair soft and manageable. Washes out easy. Would highly recommend!!! It's exactly the same as the one I used for many years before they stopped selling over the counter. I've been using Humectress products for over 20 years.  It's the go to for my long, coarse, wavy hair.  It calms my hair and leaves it healthier, shinier and so much softer.  In the summer, I'll usually keep a small container of the conditioner on hand for trips to the lake or beach.  I'll usually put a little product in my hair after a swim...comb thru it with a wide tooth comb (don't rinse)... and a few hours later I have wonderful soft beachy waves!Occasionally, I'll switch things up to see if any of the newer products do anything different.  Without fail... I always come back to Nexxus.  Btw, my kids all use it too.  They love it. Product quality differs between volume size and packaging styles, but overall good quality. Keep old bottles around to compare product ingredients. It's strange how they change so much. I do know the Therape shampoo in the grey bottle has always been my favorite, and at some time the Humectress conditioner changed formulas enough that I noticed it doesn't work quite as well, and the fragrance (if any is included) kinda stinks. But that smell is really associated with application, it doesn't stay in my hair to what I can detect. My hair is also down to my butt and I've been using these shampoos for almost 10 years.",5,5,0

It also smells great! Great for my short hair. Smell is wonderful. I have fine hair and was not overbearing. My husband has used this for years to control his short but naturally wavy (and somewhat unmanageable) hair. He likes the scent, which isn't overpowering. It isn't too greasy and doesn't give the hair stiffness; just control and definition.Recently, I discovered that it works very well for smoothing down flyaways for a sleek updo or ponytail. I also like it on those little hairs around my hairline that curl up on really humid days. It lasts all day, even in wind or high humidity, and keeps hair very soft (unlike hairspray, which feels crunchy in my hair). I even got rained on, and after my hair dried it was still smooth where I had applied the product. It's too greasy for me, with my fine hair, to use as an all-over product. His coarse hair holds up to it, but mine gets really greasy if I use more than the tiniest bit. I don't like the scent, personally, but for me that's true of all Aveda products. Still, it is a great, versatile product that lasts a really long time because you only need a tiny bit. I like the smell. I like the control it provides to my naturally curly hair. Very sleek. A little goes a long way. I first started using this product when my hairstylist, who worked for an Aveda salon, used it on my hair. Even though they closed and I go somewhere else, I buy this product via Amazon because I haven’t found anything that compares. I have a short, “boy” type hairstyle… clippers on the side, and longer pompadour-style on top. This product is pricey, but worth it. I like the scent of this product.  I don't have to use a lot for it to work.  I use it for the stray hairs that pop up on my head and around my edges.  Very satisfied with this product. Best control paste since they discontinued Magic Move, but there’s no comparison! If anyone knows where I can find it, I would be so grateful in addition to being a very happy girl.  My hair has never looked as fabulous as it did with Magic Move. I’d be so appreciative for any information.  Thank you in advance for your help!",5,5,0

Too bad it is extremely small. If you want to save money, I would look into Hunter shampoo if you want something without an aroma. I am now using SCENT AWAY, a shampoo and body wash for hunters. They do not want their smell giving them way. The request for my opinion of the pureness or thickness, I do not understand. What the heck are those qualities? I use many of the DHS products and like them all.  I use the Zinc shampoo about once a week or alternate with the SAL shampoo.  Both work really well.  I also use the DHS hair rinse if my hair feels too dry from any shampoo. It has eliminated the need for a conditioner and is light but adds enough body to eliminated fly away hair.Now I found DHS clear shampoo and I've been using it almost everyday.  Love it. Feels good , my hair isn't weighted down or irritated. .  DHS is a great company for treating issues with hair and scalp problems.  Highly recommend. I don't like that there is no smell on this product but I already knew that before I purchased it.  However; i do love the feel in my hair, soft , light and super clean.  Will highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a lightweight shampoo. recommended by my dermatologist as I can't use scented products and a lot of shampoos rinses irritate scalp - this does not This has few ingredients, almost no/no objectionable smell and generally rinses clean. Very sensitive scalp but I use this no more than once a month to clean oils from scalp and hair left behind by daily use of necessary gentler shampoo. It lathers well, strips oils out, and hair feels lighter after, but is not unduly drying. Depending upon your sensitivity this might work, despite SLS and CAPB as ingredients. My dermatologist told me to buy this because of allergies.  It actually cleans my hair really well.  No perfume so it’s great for sensitive skin.  Leaves hair nice and shiny. Great packaging- the shampoo did not leak at all. My dermatologist recommended this product and wanted to charge about double what I paid here. This stuff works great- no residue/film left on my face like normal shampoos in stores do and my face has cleared tremendously after only one use! It's clear in color and scent, so if I want my hair to have a nice scent I just use a little bit of conditioner (any kind I have on hand)- only on the ends of my hair. Not quite as great as I expected for the price.It’s not horrible, but I really couldn't tell any difference between this and the generic Walmart free and clear shampoo.",1,2,-1

Long, thick, greasy hair.  With this shampoo I can go longer without washing.  Without dry shampoo, I notice my hair starts to get greasy after 1-1.5 days.  With a bit of dry shampoo, I can add another day (or 2, or 3, pushing my luck).  Another big plus are the ingredients-- I know what all of them are!  I'm not freaky about organic food and I'm totally cool with GMO's, but I have noticed using gentler, more natural ingredients on my face and hair have really helped their condition.  For instance, when I switched to Aubrey Organics, I made sure that I wasn't switching any other part of my hair routine, in order to make a fair judgment on the product's effectiveness.  With such heavy hair, volume has always been a struggle.  I usually used shampoos geared toward adding volume, but greasiness was also starting to be more of a bother as I got busier with life (less time to dedicate towards daily hair washing, and the drying, etc. that goes with it).  Not only did this shampoo improve the condition of my scalpy greasy mess, I noticed within the first month my hair was shinier and noticeably more voluminous.Just thought I'd share for people who aren't complete grease balls: I've recently developed a thyroid condition, so my skin is getting drier (it's maybe more combination on the face, and my hair needs a bit more moisture than normal).  So my scalp is just very slightly itchy, and I know the clarifying shampoo doesn't help.  I'll probably add a less 'squeaky clean' shampoo to the mix.  But I won't let this shampoo go!  I can't find a clarifying shampoo with gentler ingredients, and I've looked at all price points.  Not saying one doesn't exist, but for this price, it'd be hard to get me to switch.The thin consistency does require some getting used to, but if you keep at it for a handful of washes, it's not a bother.  I actually forgot I had that problem when I first got this shampoo until I read the reviews just now.  So maybe the shampoo is 4.5 stars, but it's gooood. I am a young, adult male who has a naturally high hairline and VERY oily hair. These two factors combined can give the appearance of male AGA (balding)- even though I know I don't have it. I never use conditioner... because it just greases up my scalp even more, worsening the problem. Just one day after showering and using only shampoo, my hair would be as greasy as ever, and consequently become thin and brittle.I don't usually buy into ""miracle"" products. Unfortunately for me, the market for my little problem is flooded with them, thanks to masses of paranoid men with thinning hair- one of whom I was quickly becoming. After a little browsing, I decided to buy this stuff because: A- It's organic.  B- It has good reviews.  And C: It doesn't claim to do anything amazing.I didn't like it at first. The consistency and color is more like maple syrup than shampoo, and, for a short while, it left a crusty feeling in my hair when I would rinse.However...Usually after a shower, I would brush my hair, only to reveal a comb PACKED full of hairs, despite what shampoo I was using, or whether I even shampooed. I tried to ignore this, because everyone told me that this amount of hair loss was normal. It wasn't. After only my second use of this shampoo, I have noticed far, far fewer hairs ensnared in the comb. Almost none, in fact. This stuff actually does ""strengthen"" your hair to some degree, I am shocked to say. Also, my hair now goes an astonishing two full days of being free of grease - nearly twice as long as before!I never really cared about my hair- or even brushed it- until fairly recently, so I never really bothered to look for the right shampoo for my type of hair. Finally, I've found it, and I can put my scalp worries behind me. This stuff is worth a shot for anyone, and it is a Godsend if your hair is anything like mine.Buy it now! Ive tried eight different volumizing natural shampoos and this is by far the most effective. The shampoo that comes in second is EO's volumizing shampoo. They BOTH are very effective though. I love EO's volumizing shampoo. The reason why I prefer this one is the shampoo keeps my hair less oily for just a day longer (not that big of a difference, but still its convenient). I also love how it smells and the fact it has matcha green tea and ginseng!! :) I drink matcha tra every day and simply love the idea I am  putting it on my scalp. So its purely a preference of esthetics. Also this shampoo lasts longer per ounce. I only have to use a little bit. That being said for shoulder length hair, use a quarter size amount (MAX) wipe it onto hair scalp THEN lather. It wont lather immediately but when it starts to lather, ITS SUUUPER lathery. I usually shampoo the top of head and to my ears first then rinse then shampoo again on the back side of my head wiping the shampoo on my hair under the rest of hair (if that makes sense) then start to scrub. Rinse and then shampoo my whole head one more timeIf necessary with a little less of amount of shampoo. ***ALSO i use apple cider vinegar (ACV) to rinse my hair after rinsing out the shampoo. I use ACV INSTEAD of conditioner. It makes a big difference for fine, oily hair and makes my hair bouncy. No conditioner necessary! I swear! The combo of this shampoo with ACV rinse is awesome! Also because i dont use conditioner anymore, i apend a little less and it justifies for me paying a little more for this product.",5,4,1

I use it 1-2 times per week and I’ve noticed a difference in health and shine! I will re-purchase! I have thick, coarse, wavy/ curly hair. My curl patterns really differ depending on the area of my head. I wanted to live this shampoo but i dont. However i dont hate it. It does the job removing buildup and really making your scalp feel better. However for curly girls with thicker hair- beware this will dry your hair out.  I even used my Amika deep conditioner treatment with it and it was a bit dry. Ill be keeping this but really only using it in emergencies. Best clarifying shampoo I've used Great clarifying shampoo. As someone with curly hair, the products I use on a regular basis can cause product buildup. This shampoo is thorough enough to remove all the product buildup but gentle enough not to leave my hair dry and brittle. Definitely worth the buy. Will buy again. I typically use Paul Mitchell's Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner...but, I'll be completely honest: I'm lazy, and Paul Mitchell is too expensive on Amazon (compared to in-store at Ulta). So, I decided to try this so I could have it shipped to me without driving 45 minutes to my nearest Ulta or salon. I absolutely love it! I do have very, very thick, frizzy, curly hair...but I've straightened my hair after using this several times and I have NO problem with any grease. In the shower, I wet my hair...use the Quidad clarifying shampoo....let it sit for the recommended 2 minutes...rinse...then I use my regular shampoo...and then my conditioner. That's my regimen. Love it! Will definitely buy again...certainly gets rid of all the build-up that develops after the gallons of hairspray I have to use to hold my hair when I wear it in an up-do! While I’m sure the product is great, half of it leaked into the packaging and— when shampoo costs this much— you don’t want to lose that much product. It works so well, hair looks healthy and I my curls are way more manageable and look great! Absolutely love this shampoo for a once a week clean up of product residue. It doesn’t strip my curly hair of much needed moisture either.",1,4,-3

I just received this dryer and tried it out, and I am super impressed!  It's very small, foldable, super lightweight, and very powerful.  This dried my hair faster than either of the two larger dryers I have (which I now will not need any longer).  Because it's so lightweight, my arm doesn't get tired while drying my long hair.  I am VERY impressed and happy with this purchase! I really only need to blow dry my bangs or else they will dry weird so this definitely serves that purpose when on vacation. I wouldn’t rely on this to blow dry my whole head but I have long hair so that may vary for some. Love that it folds and is very compact! This blow dryer is very portable, even more so when the handle is folded down. High speed is where the majority of drying power is, as the slow setting doesn’t put out much heat at all. Keep that in mind if you need multiple heat settings, as this also doesn’t have a cold setting. The only 2 it has, is slow and warm, and fast and hot. No in between settings or cold settings. I have long, thick hair so it's necessary to have some sort of hair dryer in tow when I travel.  I picked up this one as a replacement for my old foldable dual voltage Brookstone ultra compact travel dryer, which finally disintegrated after serving me well for many years.If you need something light and packable with enough power to allow you to get out of the bathroom and on your way in as little time as possible this one will definitely work for you.Pros:*  Small, light compact design that is surprisingly powerful.  Took around 5 minutes longer to dry my hair than with my full sized home dryer.*  Retractable handle makes packing it a breeze.*  Dual voltage setting makes it unnecessary to carry an additional voltage converter.*  Two settings - low and high, though I don't find much use for the slower cooler setting (low.)Cons:*  Be VERY careful about holding the dryer close to your head as loose hair will inevitably get sucked into the fan.  There is not a very substantial screen to prevent this.*  It runs quite loud and high pitched if you are sensitive to these things.*  The cord is not especially long making it necessary to be very close to a power outlet to use We bought this to include in a small medical kit. It is smaller but just as efficient. The only thing that would make it better would be a small travel bag to carry it in. It provides good flow of air. It is fairly wide, so the flow is large without way too much speed. The dual heat setting may be a bit of disappointment. The low heat is 1/4 of the high (regular) heat setting. That may be too low for some applications. On the other hand, those who like the low heat, will not be able to use the setting abroad, on 220-230 V systems. The switch to the higher voltage is a simple engineering gimmick. The voltage switch simply locks the high (regular) speed off and allows operation at the low setting, but on higher voltage, producing the regular output. The product information states:  Product Dimensions ‏ : ‎ 5 x 9.25 x 3.5 inches; 4 Ounces. The size is about right, but the weight is 16.8 Oz. This hairdryer is nice and compact for traveling. It is also lightweight. It performs just as well as you'd expect it to- there are no frills but it gets the job done!

I bought this online because the stores stopped carrying it. Aside from the fact that you must pay a shipping fee, I am quite satisfied with this product. I have fine wavy hair that needs a little help when I use heat on it to keep it straight, and this works better for me than anything else I have tried - even in comparison to salon products. I absolutely love this, it makes my hair feel wonderful, not heavy, smooth, and so great! I will not go a day without using this now, it has become my fav hair product, I am also using the nexxus frizz defy shampoo and conditioner,but I received this before those, and even using with my old shampoo, it worked great, and after using for a while, I can tell a difference in my hair, it is smother all the time, even if I skip a washing! this is a must have! I have straight hair, I use a straigtner most the time, if im short on time, I just blow dry, in the summer if short on time I sometimes just towel dry, and this stuff works great either way, and it does not weigh my hair down, it just makes it look so much better, and feel better, and it last! and it is so much easier to style, and yes it does what it says it will do, my hair stays the way I want it, and if I decide to put it up, it takes to it and holds that, until I change it again, and it holds whatever look I want, no problem!very highly recommended! I was hoping this product did exactly what others said it did but it didn't work for me.  I have natural curly hair that I straighten daily.  It seemed to make my hair more frizzy. I definitely recommend this product, no disappointments.I have a medium thick wavy hair, and I have tried about a few straightening and smoothing products before this.  But nothing seem to work consistently which would make me stick with a product forever.  With this product, I just towel dried, and sprayed over (about 9 times) all over my hair, blow-dried for about 2-3 minutes and started to use my flat iron at my usual temp of 370. However after a few runs, I felt that my hair was becoming too hot, and I had to turn it down to 340-350.  I am simply amazed as how straight my hair was becoming even at this lesser temperature.  Not sure whether anyone had the same experience.The product claims that it trains your hair to be straight so that maintenance over time gets lesser, which I am yet to test it out.  I will update the review on my findings after a few more uses. Not great at getting hair straight or smooth I always use heat protectants when I blow-dry or use a flat iron, which is almost daily.  All the Nexus products smell great and leave my hair shiny.  Straightening?  Not too sure, but it's a nice flat iron partner. This is an OK product for straightening your hair.  The only plus about this product is that it does not make your hair supper greasy.",5,5,0

I'd rather buy direct from Mastey than the resellers, I don't trust the products from them. Steven Mastey has done a fabulous job with Dermorganic!! Thank you for picking up where your Dad left off! I've trusted the Mastey family for decades and will continue to love your style. People, you can't go wrong with this product. Consistency in thickness per bottle can vary but there's nothing wrong with the product, shake it up! A couple of years ago my hair stylist gave my hair a keratin treatment. The keratin treatment opened a whole new world of manageable hair for me; no more bangs that do funky waves instead of just hanging down straight, no more frizzing, etc. But to maintain the effects of the keratin treatments (if the hair's cared for properly they last for a few months), I was told to use a sulfate-free shampoo.My stylist sold me a bottle of this shampoo, and I've used it ever since. It's not cheap, but it's truly sulfate-free. I've read the ingredients on shampoo bottles in stores and in online shopping site listings. This is one of the few shampoos on the market that is truly free of sodium laureth sulfate. Even so-called ""all natural"" shampoos contain that sulfate ingredient.I've been buying this shampoo in liter bottles here at Amazon. Sometimes consistency is a problem; I got one bottle that seemed half-watery, half-thickened. But usually a good occasional shake-and-stir resolves the problem. The shampoo in the bottle I've almost used up right now, got thick and hard to pump; I added some hot tap water to it, shook/stirred it, and solved that problem.My keratin treatments last nicely, and I like the way this shampoo isn't harsh on my hair. It lathers up, perhaps not as much as other shampoos, but generously enough to get the job done. I now have a short hairstyle and no dry hair or split ends issues to deal with, and haven't conditioned my hair in the year since I had it cut short. This shampoo is that kind to my hair.EDITED on March 18, 2013 to add: My latest liter sized pump bottle of this shampoo has been sitting on the shelf for a few weeks until I used up my earlier one. I got very efficient and tossed out the old liter bottle, and then it took a few days to use up the shampoo I'd kept in a small bottle I'd filled for a trip. So yesterday I grabbed the new pump bottle - and the pump doesn't work. No way; I tried everything, but it won't pop up to the open position. And of course the old liter pump bottle was long gone so I couldn't reuse the pump from it. But I stumbled on to this solution. I went to a Sally's Beauty Supply store thinking I'd buy a nice sized plastic bottle to put the shampoo in. But I found they sell the actual pump top thing for a couple of bucks. I eyeballed one that looked the right size, bought it, brought it home, and HOORAY! It fits, and it works. Much better to spend a couple of bucks for a replacement pump mechanism than hassle with trying to get a seller to ship me a new one. I love the product, but would be amazing to get the correct items I paid for This shampoo make my hair oft, shiny and tangle free.  I  love it! I really love DermOrganic products and have been ordering them from here for several months now. Until this last order. There must have been a bad batch sent out or something because the shampoo was watery. It was so bad I had problems getting it from the bottle to my hair, without it running like water out of my hands.Aside from this batch the shampoo and conditioning masque are absolutely wonderful. They have saved my over processed, sun damaged, color treated hair. 7 months ago I stopped heat styling, coloring, and damaging my hair. I wanted something gentle to cleanse without stripping or putting chemicals in my hair, so I picked up this product and loved it right away. Of course, it took some time of using this and other oils in my hair to keep it in the healthy state it is in now, but once the health came back to my hair it is wonderful.Recently I switched over to 100% Pure products and am using their shampoo/conditioner now because they are totally pure, no chemicals, & cruelty free. Again on my quest to find natural, gentle products that don't damage or strip my hair I am leaving DermOrganic.IF the manufacture would quit sending out watered down versions of their shampoo and keep business real by sending out what people spend their hard earned money for, and that is the real not watered down version of their products, then I would come back to DermOrganic.This worked great in my hair, i have naturally curly, medium thick hair down to the middle of my back. This does not weigh my hair down, leave it greasy at the end of the day, nor dry. It does not de-tangle at all. Also the shine I got when using these products was amazing. Everyone was complimenting on my hair. Great moisturizing! I have been using this shampoo for about six years now. It’s marvellous. The texture is luxurious. Using it is like being pampered in a spa.My hair is normal to dry, and it needs all the moisture it can get. This definitely helps. This shampoo cleans all the way down to the scalp thoroughly, completely and gently. It gets rid of the most stubborn build up. My hair is softer, stronger and more manageable than it has been in a long time. It stays cleaner longer. I can wash my hair every 4-7 days with this shampoo.A little goes a long way. I love ❤️ this stuff! That and it’s 70% organic. So, be kind to yourself and Earth 🌍 and get this! Their conditioner of the same type is also quite good.",4,5,-1

Conditioner, Liquid, Citrus Clove (Btl-Plastic) 11oz","Update: I was originally (March 2016) very disappointed with the changed formula.  However, after a few weeks of use, it's really starting to grow on me.  I've updated my rating back to 5 stars.Cons:- It's no longer all natural, but the only unnatural ingredient seems to be the sodium benzoate (a food-grade preservative) so it's not the end of the world (please correct me if you're a chemist or something and this is wrong)- There is definitely a transition period when you begin using the new formula after years of using the old.  For the first few weeks, your hair will be weird.  This is the reason for my original negative review.Pros:-  After a few weeks, it actually seems shinier and has a more defined curl pattern (probably due to the higher aloe content in the new formula).  The new formula is lighter so my curls are tighter, but I'm ok with this.- The new formula is cheaper (maybe because of a longer shelf life due to the sodium benzoate preservative?) Why I chose this product?I have very dry, sensitive skin. I have eczema and many allergies. I also have very thick, coarse hair that can be dry and frizzy. I was looking for a product that had jojoba oil and aloe because of their hydrating properties and because they don't aggravate my sensitive skin.Why is this product special?This product is the only product that I have tried that does not irritate my skin. I have even tried the ""Island Natural"" by the same company but it did not work well with my skin and hair. This product is thick and creamy and hydrates my hair without irritating my skin. It just takes some time to wash out. I would recommend using the J.A.Y Desert Herb shampoo along with this conditioner.Rating:I am giving this product a 5 out of 5 mainly because it's the only product that does not irritate my dry, sensitive skin. Hard to get,but well worth it.I am a man with long hair,and it is the perfect follow up to the Aubrey GPB shampoo,and I love the smell This was my favorite conditioner for my thick curly always dry hair. The company was sold to a company in the U.K. and there is no word on whether this product will be available again in the United States or anywhere. R.I.P. J.A.Y. This conditioner is excellent as far as smoothing and moisturizing frizzy hair; however, I'm having allergic reaction to it (my scalp and ears feel hot after washing my hair).  Am pretty sure the allergic reaction is from the conditioner, not the shampoo (also J.A.Y.).  I used the shampoo before with the Blue Green Algae mask by Aubrey and didn't have any problem.  Too bad.  I would have given it four stars. Love this conditioner, healthy, good for my hair! Not thick like other conditioners.  It actually feels as if too little spreads onto your hair at first, but it does a wonderful job leaving hair soft. I use this and the matching shampoo on my girls' very curly red hair.  Taming curly hair is a brutal operation.  This stuff is a big help.  Wash, rinse, add conditioner and comb it out.  Then let it sit a few minutes.  Really, Really great.",1,4,-3

I used it for YEARS and the compliments just kept coming - from complete strangers -  anybody.  Even my Doc made a complimentary remark.  Now for some reason a great product has been destroyed/discontinued by uncaring people.  They have a rinse that is said to be comparable.  But it is a complete MESS to use...it's drippy and runny...I have used in the bathroom shower and bathtub...It's that bad.  .  I contacted Revlon the parent company and got a wishy washie answer from them.... I am looking for an alternative.......I am really quite disappointed that the product has been pulled....Shame, shame  on Revlon, Shame... Not sure about package arriving in an envelope and top missing Makes my hair easier to handle and cuts down on frizz. One of the only places that I can find it is Amazon. Has gotten a little pricey but I really like it. I bought this product after much shopping for something to reduce the brassy red in my blonde streaked hair.  My beautician told me that the red in my hair in natural, and sun, chlorine and metals in the water bring it out in spite of her best efforts.  My allergies kick up with most toner products.  Surprisingly, although I do have an allergic response to Roux Fanci Full rinse, I do not have that response to this blue toner mousse.  It works well to reduce the red tones. [ I am 64+, and my hair is still mostly mouse brown naturally, some gray, a lot of blonde and red highlights.]  I do not use this everyday, just as needed, and a little goes a long way. I took off one star, because, as a mousse, it doesn't ""lift"" my crown hair as well as some.  It also doesn't foam high coming out of the bottle, so it is hard to judge the amount to use.  But it isn't sticky once it dries.  I know a lot of my friends with very fine grey hair could use this.  Overall, a good product and one I will order again.  I have not found it available in local stores. Similar mousses have ingredients which will cause me to itch on my scalp. It works, but leaves my gray hair more coarse than what it usually is. I like it far better than the white minx liquid leave in temporary color. The mouse isn't messy and if you have some yellow in your gray, as some people do, it will eliminate the yellowing. My hair is mostly silver and the white minx turns it more white, which I like. Also, a little does a lot, so don't over use. I have hair to my earlobes and it isn't thin. I use about the size of a half dollar and it is more than enough. Loved the original formula of White Minx....it was perfect.  It's still, even with the new formula, the best solution for keeping silver hair bright and non-brassy, but this new formula is watery, seems to have too much lavender color in it and the aeration in the can is not good.  I just had to toss a can that was at least 1/3 full but just would not come out of the nozzle...aeration all gone.  Anyway, Roux, please see what the problem is and what change was made from the original that makes this version far inferior! This does work. I feel you have to do use quite a lot of it, however. My fine hair seemed weighed down a bit by it. Simply because I used three applications to get the tonality I wanted. If you do not have much yellowing to cover I feel you could use less. I do feel that this is a great solution for someone who already uses a mousse or for someone who does not need a great deal of toning. For me, there was quite a bit of yellow in my bleached hair so I used more than what I would have liked. This product is terrific and easy to use.  50 years ago I used the liquid on my frosted hair-same white mink.  This mousse is an excellent improvement.  I just recently grew hair out from salon-colored red (with highlights) to my natural grey.  I don't have any yellowing, but this product makes my silver/grey shiny and the mousse gives me the hold I need-no other styling product necessary.  I have short hair.Although I still have product left, I'm going to reorder-just in case!",2,1,1

It works just the same! I finally had to buy a replacement for my wife after maybe 10 yrs of use and finally gave because I accidentally dropped it. 😬 Over the last several years, I always stuck w/ a cheaper flat iron, prob in the $25-$35 price bracket. I constantly would try different hair products, thinking that was the issue. My hair is naturally curly, and gets very big in humidity especially.  After the last trip to the salon, the hair dresser used her very fancy, expensive flat iron on my hair...and what a difference!!!!  Her's was super expensive, so there was not way I could afford it.  But she did say that investing in a good flat iron was worth it. She said the cheaper flat irons do get very hot, but do not give off the right kind of heat, which results in damage, and less than stellar results.  So w/ that said, the hunt was on to find a reasonably priced iron, w/ good reviews.  After reading the reviews of this one, it seemed that overall everyone was happy. Also, the only negative reviews were that some long time users felt the product was not as heavy duty as it once was. Still, the results seemed to be ok.  I looked up various lists on line for ""best flat irons,"" and this one made a couple lists. So after reading the reviews, and seeing the sale price, i went for it. I must say that i absolutely love it!!!  Whenever it would rain in the past, I would automatically just wear my hair up to not have to deal w/ my hair fighting the humidity. This past weekend, i wore it down w/ no issues!! lol (Keeping hair dry of course though).  I highly recommend and very pleased w/ this product! I've had a GHD flat iron for many many years and recently it broke probably because I wrapped the cord around the flat iron to store it (won't be doing that again). I wanted to replace my flat iron right away since I wear my hair straight everyday, but I didn't want to break the bank (GHDs are well over 100 dollars--at Sephora they're priced at 185). Luckily, I remembered my friend from high school had a HAI and it worked well for her and for me whenever I would borrow it. I had no idea how much the HAI cost until I looked it up on Amazon, and I was very happy to find out that it was much cheaper than the GHD iron. Long story short, for the price this flat iron works very well, perhaps just as well as my GHD iron. I have really thick and coarse hair so the fact that I can adjust the temperature to 400 is a great feature (the GHD is at a fixed temperature around 370 I believe). Also, a welcome difference is that the plate is 1/4 inch wider, which doesn't sound like a lot, but actually makes a big difference. So ultimately, I am able to compare this HAI iron to the top of the line GHD, which costs a lot more, and I can say that the HAI can compete. To be completely honest, I can tell the GHD is a tad bit better, but not THAT much better, so the fact that the HAI iron is comparable but 3 times cheaper is great! I believe this is the same iron that my hair stylist used on my hair and was pleasantly surprised to see it for an affordable amount, unlike at the salon (I think it was selling for $180 there).  The iron heats up quickly and I haven't had any issues with it yet, unlike some of the other users.  The dial allows you to select the proper temperature to use for your hair type, which is convenient.It seems that allowing my hair to dry fully and then running it through the iron allows it to straighten without having the frizzy ends.  So unlike some users that have used this product on wet hair, I get better results after drying my hair.I haven't plugged and unplugged the iron often and they send instructions to keep it plugged in if possible, using the on/off switch instead of fulling disconnecting from the plug to turn it off.  I'm not sure if this is due to issues they've had with the plug/cord or for our convenience, although the latter doesn't seem likely; as you are instructed to unplug most electrical appliances that are used in the restroom, when not in use.The decision maker for me was that it was a decently priced model for a ceramic flat iron.  I've read other flat iron complaints from melting ceramic plates, cords with shorts, to the ceramic plate falling off entirely from the iron.  I figured that if I'm going to dish out $$$ for a flat iron, might as well get a good ceramic iron for a decent price considering all the different problems that can occur with them. I've been using this iron for 25 years and in that time I've gone through 2. This is the 3rd one I've purchased and I will never go with another one. It never pulls my hair like some of the other brands. It is well made and durable. When I got this product I was sad because the temperature only went to 410 degrees because the straightener I use to use went to 440 degrees.  BUT let me tell you don't let that degree difference discourage you because after using this product my hair was so shiny and silky soft!! To also add my hair came more straight using this product compared to the one I use to use. I am blown away by the quality of this product and would definitely recommend!!!",1,5,-4

Leaves my hair shinny and moisturized. After washing my hair, I mix it with a deep mask and leave it for 1 hour then rinse. leaves my hair looking young and hydrated. Of course, next day getting up my hair are a big mess but since I use this they are much easier to maintain. I mist them with water place them under a bonnet for 1/2, while i get ready for work, coffee and all, then spray a leave in conditioner and revamp my hairdo. I notice a nice difference for the better since using this oil. I was concerned that the smell of this oil would be too strong but it's nothing compared to the Indian hair oil I was using.  My daughter (who is 17yoa)  has long, thick, bleached hair that breaks off easy and very damaged from bleaching.  I mix Amia Hair Oil with Coconut Oil  (1/4 Amia Hair Oil 3/4 Coconut oil).  Heat in microwave for about 1.5 minutes so it melts and is warm.  Then I apply to my daughter's hair with a children's  medicine dropper.  Start at the front of her head applying to the scalp massaging the scalp for about 5 minutes.  Then I apply more to the ends, working the oil all through her hair.  Leave's it in for at least an hour or sometime overnight.  It has worked wonders on her hair.  Washes out easy and does not leave hair oily.  We have her hair trimmed to cut off split ends every six weeks.  After 4 weeks of using the oil 2-3 times a week, she had no split ends.  Our hairdresser was amazed!  She excepted to have to trim at least 1/4"" but didn't even touch her hair with the scissors.  My daughter only washes her hair 2-3 times a week but uses heat every day to style it.  I have very fine, thin, straight,  shoulder length bleached hair I only use it 1 time every couple of weeks.  Both my daughter and I have noticed amazing repair of damage to hair along with faster growth.  For us the smell is not noticeable when mixed with coconut oil.  Even just by itself, it's NOTHING compared to the Indian Oil we were using and the results are far greater then anything else we've ever used. Great for when I have dry hair. Smell is kind of ""love it"" or ""hate it"". I don't mind the scent at all. Smells pretty natural to me. As a bonus, it helps disguise some of the grey hair if you still have other dark hair on your head (if that is important to you!) I absolutely love this product. I got it in yesterday and I have a special hair care routine that I do, but I was so anxious to try this product that I just had to try it anyway. I put the oil all over my head, massaged it into my scalp, and let it sit for 2 hours. Then I took a shower and washed it all out. When I was done taking a shower I let my hair air dry and it was so soft and silky. It felt like I blow dried my hair. Once my hair was completely dry I took a little bit, not too much, and put it on my ends and on my body of my hair (not the scalp). My hair was instantly shiny. Warning: don't put too much because your hair will look dirty and greasy. As for today, before school I put some on my ends again and I love how this makes my hair feel. I will absolutely order this again once I run out. I shower every 2nd day because it is not healthy to shower every day, and from now on I am going to put this in my hair for a couple hours before I shower. On other reviews I read about the smell, I personally don't mind it because it reminds me of being a little girl. Let me say that it is a little strong and may take some time to get use to. I think that getting this product is worth getting because you can just mask the smell with some leave in conditioner or something. I recommend this product for people with dry hair that needs some moisture. I ordered this bottle of Amla oil six months ago because I've been experiencing hair mild hair loss (feels worse than that, but I have to objectively say it's mild, mostly around my temples) for a little over a year now.  I'm a healthy 24 year old woman and I can't find a reason for the shedding.  I read that Amla oil helps grow hair, so I figured I'd give it a try.  For the first month I was just applying it directly to my scalp, but then I felt inspired and made an elixir, using 1/2 amla oil 1/2 jojoba oil as a base, plus about 10 drops each of tea tree, rosemary, and clary sage essential oils.  I rub a few drops onto my scalp after each shampoo.  It hasn't thickened my hair too much, but I have noticed that my hair is growing LONGER much faster.  If you're looking to increase the length of your hair, buy this stuff!The smell is mild, pretty earthy and herbal.  I think it's pleasant but it probably isn't too palatable to a lot of Americans.  The bottle is really big for the price, and will last me forever at this rate.  I I just received the Amla Oil in the mail today and was looking forward to trying it. I immediately looked at the ingredients listed on the bottle and they are,in this order:Natural sesasme seed oilAyurvedic emblica officinalis (Indian Gooseberry / Amla)Piper LongumTinospora CordifoliaNatural fragranceI was surprised by the sesame seed oil. I wasn't aware it's good for hair.  I Googled it and did find that sesame seed oil is, in fact, good for hair. I also learned that it has hair darkening capabilities.  I recall reading in some of the reviews for this product, that it has darkened the hair of some users.  I also Googled emblica officinalis and learned its the offinal name for Amla. Was happy to learned that.  Always good for Amla oil to contain Amla, right?  Then I Googled Piper Longum and Tinospora Cordifolia and I'm wondering why these two ingredients are included. I didn't find anything that suggested they are good for hair or helps hair grow. They are good for many  other things like Diarrhea, gonorrhea, syphllis, etc...things you woulndn't think would be synonymous with hair growth. Maybe Bazaar India (the importer of this product) could explain that.I'm going to give it a try and see if there's a difference in my hair by the time I finish the bottle.  If there's no difference, oh well.  Didn't cost much to try and I won't be buying again. For now, I give it three stars because of how it made my hair feel...very soft and moisturized.",1,2,-1

I have fine, wavy, and thick (meaning a ton of it) hair that also happens to get pretty oily, especially after working out or not washing it for a couple of days. Most conditioners I’ve found are too heavy/will make my hair soft in the morning after a wash but end up making it look greasy and attract dirt by the end of the day, especially on days when I just rinse/throw in some conditioner and wash it out.  I decided to give this conditioner a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised! It restores my hair’s natural volume, keeps it wavy, shiny, soft and best of all, does not make it greasy by the end of the day! I use a blueberry sized amount applied to my mid-lengths to ends, which seems to be enough for my shoulder length hair.  I would strongly recommend this for fine, oily hair types that need just a little hydration boost. This works well with the shampoo  I currently  use (NaturOli Soapnut Shampoo for Oily Hair) as well as on its own when I just rinse my hair with water. It doesn’t smell great  (I hate how most of the Jason products smell), but the  smell does go away  by the time my hair dries. If how it smells is a dealbreaker for you, though, I would probably avoid this. But for me, since it just makes my hair look and feel so great, I will probably keep putting up with how it smells.UPDATE:I’ve been using this for a couple of months now, and I still find it definitely worth the cost and putting up with the fragrance. I get the best results when I put a quarter size amount in my mid-lengths to ends, put my hair up in a shower cap, and leave it in for 3-5 minutes before rinsing it out with cold water. My hair is soft, detangled, and most importantly still has its wavy volume and is not weighed down, or greasy. I’ve switched shampoos (serial shampoo switcher here), but it still works well with my new one (OGX Hydrating Sunflower Blonde). did make my hair appear thicker. Really liked it. One of the reasons hair thins as we age is the harsh chemicals in most shampoos and conditioners. Sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates (SLS), used as sudsing agents, strip your hair of protective natural oils that keep your scalp healthy, and your hair shiny and full. Jason shampoos and conditioners contain no sulfates, petrolatum, parabens or phthalates. The Thin to Thick shampoo and conditioner is a volumizer that really works. Your hair looks and feels fuller and shinier. I recommended it to a client whose hair was thinning as she got older, and she swears by it. She showed me patches in her receding hairline where the hair is actually growing back! Even without SLS, it sudses up just fine and people tell me my hair looks healthy and think my hair is naturally thick. In fact, my hair stylist says my hair is very fine. The entire line of Jason shampoos and conditioners work on specific hair issues. We have a dayschool, and often recommend Tee Tree Oil shampoo to parents of school aged children to prevent or treat lice. And again, it contains natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. Jason products are never tested on animals. When you use it, you just know you are doing something really good for your hair! I bought the shampoo and conditioner for its mostly natural ingredients. Wasn't expecting a miracle for thickening my hair but it's been a couple of weeks and I don't see any difference whatsoever. I LOVE the smell of this conditioner. It makes my hair soft, but it doesn't have the best thickening effect. Switched from Dove Oxygen Moisture Shampoo and can tell that my hair does not appear as thick as it did when I used Dove. BUT it's more natural than Dove and does an okay job at thickening so I think I'll continue using it. Using with the shampoo.  I really like it so far.  A little goes a long way and it leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I have a decent amount of hair, but each hair is very fine.  I can't really say it gives extra volume (like in a styling product way) but it is not weighed down either.-i wash, condition & air dry.  if you want the type of volume associated with styling products this probably won't cut it (Davines Volu shampoo, conditioner and spray is what I use when I want really big hair.  That stuff is awesome but it makes your hair a bit wig-like and it builds up, so you can't use it everyday; more for going out etc.)  wanted a good everyday product, this fits the bill.",4,5,-1

oil,"Alberto VO5 Herbal Escapes Kiwi Lime Squeeze Clarifying Shampoo, 15 Ounce","I was dying my hair lighter (every 6 months) a few years ago. My hair is almost as fine as a babies, It couldn't take the harsh chemicals.I stopped dying it, and once a month I used a clarifying shampoo I found in a local store (not this brand it was more expensive). I've also been using 4 different, other kinds of shampoos, as I heard a long time ago, that's it's better for your hair not to get used to one. It took a while for my hair to look good again.It's been a couple of years now I wasn't using clarifying shampoo any more. When I saw this I thought I'd buy it, as my hair hasn't been looking as good lately, and the reviews were so good.I used it for the first time today, it lathered reasonably well, then I noticed it didn't feel good. As I lathered it into my hair, it didn't feel the same, my hair felt really dry like straw, I was very worried.After I rinsed it, I used 'Alberto V05 Moisture Milk Conditioner' which I was also using for the first time. The prices are so good for this shampoo and conditioner. This year, pre-teen daughter has gone head first into puberty and has been suffering many of the less then fun side effect, including terrible oily skin. Even with taking a shower every morning before school, and not using any conditioner at all in her hair, by the time she gets home her hair looks like she has washed it in a week. And on gym days, it's even worse. A hairdresser recommended she try using a clarifying shampoo since she had such a constant build up of oil.After about a week of using this VO5 Kiwi Lime Clarifying shampoo, I'm starting to see a bit of a difference. On days when she has gym, her hair is still a little rough by the time she gets home from school. But on days when she has music class instead of gym, she comes home without her hear looking oily and stringy. After running a brush through it, it even gets fluffy again. She likes the scent and says she likes how it makes her hair feel. I just with I had realized sooner that this shampoo would work so well for her! While for some people just using a clarifying every so often to remove product build up works best for them, this is a perfect daily solution for a teem pr pre-teen who suffers from constant daily oily hair. This product removes the built up hair products better than a more expensive brand.  I used this brand before and knew I needed to return to using it after trying another. The shampoo works wonders for softening and conditioning your hair without having to use a conditioner separately. I haven't used a clarifying shampoo in a very long time . My hair felt like it needed to be completely clear of all products . but hair felt off so i decided to try this shampoo since i had used it in the past . but now i remember why i stop using it . It is very drying even after applying deep conditioner . This is not a shampoo that should be used weekly ,maybe once a month . Smell is pleasant , gets very sudsy , had to make sure my hair was thoroughly rinsed because it still felt like i had alot more shampoo in my hair . A little bit goes a long way Found this suggested on curly hair subreddit for product buildup.  I use once a week and really like it. I will keep this in my routine for helping with product build up. The smell is nice and has a great lather I just tossed all my Deva Curl products after the hair loss news broke so I was looking for a quick replacement for a reset wash shampoo and this V05 one is amazing! As a curly girl who follows a natural hair/ curly girl method routine this product is awesome why spend $$$ on salon products when this works just as well if not better?!? It did what it was supposed to do, smells good. Suds up. It was ok.",1,3,-2

My hair became dry and brittle when I turned 60.  I have used Jason shampoo and conditioner with castor oil for 2 years.  My hair is now soft and healthy.  The scent is very nice!  I am not one to give reviews, but for this, I had too!  A definite product to try. This conditioner is pretty good. Has a light pleasant smell and makes my hair soft. The one thing I don't like is how hard you have to squeeze to get the conditioner out. I leave mine upside down because it makes the conditioner come out better since you don't have to squeeze as hard Good product, no complaints, except for the bottle it's in dash I have a hard time squeezing the conditioner out of the bottle - it's so difficult for me, that I might not order this conditioner again, however I like the conditioner itself very much. I really like the fresh smell, not to perfume smelling. Sadly, I didnt like the shampoo . But this conditioner is good.Safe for color treated hair also.Read my review on the shampoo Ive been using this conditioner for a few months now. Im ordering ny third bottle now. It makes my hair feel stronger and thicker. I like it. I have really been enjoying a lot of the Jason brand products. This is the only shampoo and conditioner on the market right now that doesn't cause me to break out in giant hives.  Excellent product.  So angry with Sprouts for discontinuing it I am discontinuing my shopping at Sprouts. I give this 5 stars because it honestly made my hair mad soft and even look healed after just one wash, definitely love the brand",4,4,0

My hair feels clean, looks shiny and healthy. I've used this shampoo for years now and though switching a few times always go back to this one.I'm allergic to fragrance , dyes and extra oils, etc. and this product is very gentle on my hair and scalp. I've been searching for an all-natural shampoo for years. Every product that sounded good at first turned out to have nasty chemicals hidden in the ingredients list. Tate's ingredient list, while very unusual, does not have anything scary in it. So I decided to order the shampoo and conditioner after reading so many great reviews.Well, I don't know how they do it but my hair looks and feels better than it has in years. And during those years I have spent a fortune on salon brands. I was born with thick, coarse, straight red hair but I have a lot of grey and white streaks these days and color my hair blonde. My hair is shoulder length and was getting ""fuzzy"", especially towards the ends. Every shampoo and conditioner I tried either didn't help the fuzzies or weighed my hair down and made it feel oily or dirty.After one shampoo I am absolutely thrilled. My hair feels sleek and silky right down to the ends again, full of body, shiny, and I didn't even have to blow-dry it for it to fall beautifully. I really didn't expect results this good. I've always gotten compliments on my hair but now it looks even better and all I had to do is wash and condition it. I'm hooked. I even love the almond scent. This really is a miracle product. Tate's is the absolute best ""pH"" balanced shampoo out there...many shampoos say they're pH balanced and they are not! And that's the absolute truth! This company is reliable for selling a quality product that is free of chemicals and that lasts long when used correctly...another important thing to note is that I have weak porous bones and when I use other shampoos...my bones begin to hurt! People think your hair is not connected to your bones but they mysteriously are...this shampoo does not strip or make my bones hurt...it is truly and honestly a pH balanced shampoo!!! Enough said...buy some! UPDATE! I just spent hours researching this and it turns out everything is FAKE! The ""owner"" of Tate's is located in Massachusetts. His real name is Steve something. He buys cheap gallons of shampoo and conditioner from Sally's for less that $4.50/gallon. Then he fills the Tate's bottle in the basement of his home. Go to the BBB website for more information. Please make complaints. AND STOP USING THIS PRODUCT!ORIGINAL POST-----------------------Over the past years, I have spent more money on this company's products than I care to admit. It wasn't until I saw the recent reviews today that I even considered there might be a problem. I just googled their location and it came up as a place called Dura-Bilt Drapery & Upholstery. Another reviewer said it is also the location for Kathy's Family. Sure enough! Tate's Natural Miracle claims to be a family business out of a home in Ohio? A home surrounded by nature and all the ingredients used in making this product? NOT! Something is very, VERY wrong here! In addition, the names are completely fictitious! No records can be found. I also googled the phone number and it came up on 800notes. There are comments on there from PAST EMPLOYEES! They say the ""owner"" is broke, a crook, and a slimeball. None of the ingredients are even natural!!! There is also an owner name given, but I couldn't find records. Many complaints have been made to the BBB. I will be adding mine to the others soon, however, I feel that something with greater ramification must be done! This is unexceptionable, immoral, and against the law! I'm terrified about what chemicals I have been putting on my body for the past 3 years!!! A lawsuit is hopefully in this guy's future. I can think of many, many charges he will be up against! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! DO NOT GIVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY!!! IT IS A FRAUD!!! I just opened my most recently purchased bottle of Tate’s shampoo and I am wondering if you changed your formula. It seemed way more watery than my last bottle and had a completely different fragrance. I was very happy with past purchases of this product but this time, not so much. It leaves me wondering if it’s a counterfeit or if you’ve changed your product drastically. I have used this product for 18 years .I can ONLY use this product, I am so sensitive to anything even all natural I have tryed from other makers  I use this for hand soap and body an shampoo. YOU MUST DELUTE THE PRODUCT WITH WATER!!!! IT IS A CONCENTRATED  PROD then it will not ""burn"" as one review states. (It makes alot when you delute. ) Reading the other review, I guess you should stay away from this shampoo if you are allergic to blackberries, apples or any of the other natural ingredients that this wonderful stuff is made from, but as I am not allergic to anything I have found it to be a true MIRACLE for my hair.  My only complaint is that the ingredients are not organic, and I do try to use all organic things in and on my body ... but I use this as a hair wash every few weeks or so, when my regular Aubrey Organics favorite shampoo no longer seems to work as well and I need to ""wake up"" my hair with something different.  This does the trick, and leaves my very thick and coarse blond hair shiny and soft.  I recommend it.",5,5,0

I am bi racial, and wear my hair in kinky curls 98% of the time. Hayashi 911 re constructor I leave this product in and let my hair air dry. I have found that it holds my curls in place and keeps them from frizzing out. Its also a great detangler. I originally bought it in Toronto, but the store there no longer carries it so I have had to resort to ordering it online. So I get the big bottle and always re order when I'm down to the last quarter. I highly recommend this product. I've been using this product for almost 15 years.  But, it's difficult to find in the stores.  I was so happy to find this online.  It's less expensive, and I don't have to drive around.  I'm not happy about the new bottle design.  This is a very thick product, and the extra long neck makes it difficult to get out of the bottle.  Apparently, the genius who designed this doesn't actually use the product.  Nevertheless - it's still a great product. If you buy the 911 Emergency in this bottle, it’s called reconstructor, it is thick, rich, and works wonders on damaged hair; it gets a five hands down. However, if you get the purple bottle, the formula has changed and it's no longer the same product. It is thin like a creme rinse and does not condition the hair at all like the old formula. I'd give it a one or two star rating. I understand from the seller that Hayashi changed the product as well as the packaging...too bad. Product makes hair nice soft yet strong at same time detangles . Smells good doesn't weight down hair after putting on a lot . Made my hair mor manageable especially after going through a natural hair transition from being relaxed. If you using on natural hair might use quite a bit & will go fast . Relax hair will use less . Have loved this product for years, but it is apparently not available to we Aussies for some inexplicable reason. Wish we could purchase it more readily here. The exchange rate and overseas postage are deterrents in purchasing from overseas. I have been using this conditioner for over 40 years... absolutely LOVE it! I do not like the bottle with this skinny neck, it makes it difficult to get the product out! great product, my hair is no longer frizzy.  the cream is thick, should come in a jar.  what's up with the long neck?  i have to make it upside down before squeeze it out. the old packaging is better, new one looks cheap. Terrible from what it used to be “System 911”. Don’t waste your money!!!",5,5,0

The fragrance is strawberry, but after I started using it, I started smelling pot everywhere I went. It was driving me crazy!!  I finally realized that it was this product.  I had all my friends smell it to confirm too!!  I haven't seen any reviews that mention this so I'm curious if any others have experienced it. I have medium length, chemically-treated, fine hair.  I was hoping this product would do what it is advertised to do...condition while creating volume.  It does neither of these things well.  It provides little if any volume and doesn't make my hair feel conditioned, but just greasy.  It does work well as a detangler, but it comes at the price of your hair feeling flat and greasy the rest of the day.As far as the smell....I don't mind the smell of this product when you are spraying it and while my hair is wet.  However, the smell seems to change when I dry my hair, and I swear it smells skunkish or something, similar to the smell of marijuana.  Sounds weird, but the first couple of days I used this, I thought people next to me at work and in stores must have been smoking weed.  Finally, I realized it was just my hair.  Not something I want to smell like. It's probably my fault I don't like this - I needed a detangler for my daughter.  You can't use this like a detangler - it smells too strong and if you put too much on it never dries and the hair is sticky, it actually makes the tangles worse by the end of the day.  I can tell you it does thicken because when I put her hair up in a ponytail I can't wrap it around as many times, it's like there is more hair. Absolutely amazing. No blow dryer required for added volume (horray). The smell is a bit strong, but smelling like strawberries all day is worth it for the results. I have very fine hair that gets oily easily. This conditioner does not turn my head into a slick mess, nor is my hair sticky or tacky. Not sure it is the greatest for detangling little heads, but my daughter still loves it because of the sent. Will definitely keep this product stocked from now on. Smells absolutely wonderful and really makes my hair feel soft.  My hair was so dry and flyaway before, but after using this product it was very soft.  Did not weigh it down either which I was worried about because my hair is so fine.  I love this stuff! Hands down the best leave in conditioner I've ever tried, and I have tried a lot.  I have long, thick, naturally curly hair and when I spray this in, the comb literally goes right through it.  If I could give this 100 stars I would.  The smell is great, doesn't leave my hair feeling heavy.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Thank you Bed Head! If you spray too much into your hair, it will get crunchy.. like hairspray.I noticed maybe a small hint of volumizing, if that.. but no effects of conditioning.It's not as effective of a product as other Tigi brand products that I've used. Not a bad product, not a home run product either. I don't plan to repurchase, but did use the whole bottle of this stuff. I've been using this product for several years. I've tried others, but still come back to this one. It gives my hair great volume and makes my hair soft without being stiff or sticky. I hope they keep on making it, as is forever.",1,5,-4

This resurrected my long shiny hair that was breaking off, because I use a store bought hair color on the roots, and sooner or later, it damages.  I have subsequently learned that I don't need to use it while the processing is going on, in other words, I wait now once I mix it, since my hair is already processed, (making it drier) and then put it on after 45 minutes, and yes it still colors my roots just fine.  I use both the hair color conditioner and this afterwards, rinsing it out but not to the point where the conditioner is gone.  My hair is thicker, it stopped breaking off, and I'm happy.  I use a lo of it, I mean a big pile in the palm of my hands at least four times per week when I wash it.  I do not use a lot of shampoo, I use a small squirt because hair doesn't really get too dirty or oily if you wash it every other day which I do..but I realized I do not need to over shampoo by using too much, that strips the hair.  I definitely recommend this! I discovered this line when my stylist recommended it to me. The price was so low (at Ulta or the grocery stores) I could hardly believe how great it was. L'Oreal discontinued it and I began to try other shampoos. My hair started to feel like cotton, instead of silky and strong. Even my BFF noticed the difference and thought I was losing my hair! The new line from L'Oreal is dreadful. I tried MUCH more expensive products, too, and my hair was weak and felt thin. Who knew shampoo and conditioner could make SUCH a difference, especially when they are only on your hair for a few minutes!Even though I had to pay about 3x what this USED to cost, I stocked up on a year's supply. Don't know what I'll do when the day comes that I can't find it anymore. I got this for my daughter (three years old) and I because we both have very fine and easy to tangle hair. It is a nice light conditioner, with a mild pleasant smell. I put it on my daughter after she is all clean and have her play in the tub while it stays in her hair for a few minutes. Each application keeps our hair softer and easier to brush out for a few days. Really obviously made my hair shine. Feels great. Loved both the shampoo and conditioner and feels that it works better together. I never get comments on my hair and recently have been complimented! It's gotta be the shampoo and conditioner! Just found out that they carry it at Target for less money and no shipping hassle. Just saying... Took a chance on ordering this with the shampoo.  Very nice for the after rinse.  My dry hair needs some nourishment or it will fly all over but this seems to work well.  Would receommend. expensive but leaves hair full and smelling awesome! I only use this when I plan on getting close to someone... makes you want to go right up to someone and smell their hair! LOL- need to drop the price alittle though I was tired of what I was finding at the dollar store and the drug stores and had to find another product to add to an order to get my free shipping so I chose this. I am so glad I did. I have horrid hair..dried out from decades of overprocessing and disdain..This stuff makes it feel like human hair. Nice. Alas, Loreal doesn't make this conditioner anymore! I use it as a leave in conditioner on my naturally curly African American hair. It adds shine and softness and really brings out the curl. I suspect it's the royal jelly in it.

Seller sold a item and described it well. My only tiny tiny issue is with the manufacturer. I was expecting a thicker oil and not one so thin. An I'm not so sure it's actually carrot oil. I received the product on Tuesday, the packaging was okay. There wasn't any visible leaks and the lid was tight. I purchased this product because I used to use it a couple of years ago when I was relaxing my hair. It was the only oil that I was using, bc I had stopped using hair grease. I started out with short thinning hair and in a few weeks my hair was getting thicker, and within a year my hair was down in the middle of my back. Now I am in transition to natural hair and wanted to try it out to see if it would have the same effect. So today I went to the stylist and had my hair washed and deep conditioned. When I got home I took a small amount and patted it onto my hair and took a bit and rubbed it onto my scalp. I didn't find the smell to be too unpleasant, but I did notice a slight oily smell. After applying my hair was still soft and shiny, it has been a few hrs and hair is still soft, shiny and moisturized. It is a bit oily and a small amount goes a long way, if you were to apply too much then it will run down your neck and face. I just started today so I'm gonna give it 3 stars for now, I will try to write another review soon. Been using this for years. It's a miracle in a bottle. Also so cheap. The only thing that tames my frizzy thick hair enough that I can make nice curls. For long hair, quarter size, apply on damp hair. If applied on dry hair, use a lot less. This size is very difficult to find in stores. Many stores carry two ounces. Many years ago a friend of mine whose dad was a barber swore by carrot oil and that was all my friend used to use and probably use until this day. I waited a while before giving this review to see how this would do on my hair. Carrot oil has made my hair much stronger and there is less shedding when I comb my hair. I will continue to order this product and use it as part of an everyday staple for my hair regimen.The smell was pleasant and not overbearing and I did not find this product to be greasy. It goes great if you decide to mix it with another oil such as olive oil and or whatever oil you may use. I love this stuff. I tell all my friends about it and how great it repairs stringy think hair. Takes a few weeks of conditioning, but it really heals your hair. This carrot oil is light and not scented.  It goes onto your hair nicely and creates a nice luster making the hair more manageable and less dry.  I have extremely dry hair and this oil helps me to keep it supple without weighing it down.  Will feel too greasy if you use too much - only a little pea sized dot will do your entire head - and I have a lot of hair.Great for dry skin too - prob not for your face but great for softening up the body - especially like the dry cracked heels, elbows and knees.Works nice for cuticles too!I found it to work as well as expensive hair treatments at a fraction of the cost.",5,5,0

I finally figured it out, since I have thin hair, the denmen could not get a grip (tension) on my hair.  This brush is great for my hair and I love the outcome.  Much quicker than finger coiling. So firstly let me start off with a little on myself. I'm 18, female, and big chopped my hair for the second time in a year. My hair is 3b/3c and I haven't washed my hair with anything other than conditioner in around 3 months. I ordered this brush despite some of the negative reviews because I'm trying to transition to a water only / sebum only hair care routine. Yesterday on 9/11/15 --my heart goes out to the families who lost a loved one on that horrific day, 14 years ago-- I received the brush 3 days earlier than expected which really got me so excited since it was part of a birthday gift I bought for myself. The brush didn't come wrapped in anything besides the bubble wrap delivery envelope which isn't a big deal in my opinion. I immediately inspected the bristles to make sure they aren't nylon. I clipped one off and held it with tweezers and burned it. It smelled like burnt hair so I am assuming it to be boar hair. I had a pure boar bristle brush when I was a kid and had it for 9 years before I broke it. I read a lot of the reviews and people were complaining about the gloss coming off. In my opinion I don't think it's a big deal , eventually all the gloss will come off and it will look uniform again the only down side is it will be dull :( oh well. Also a lot of people were complaining of the brush comeing missing a single complete bundle of boar hair and the nylon bristle however, I'm pretty sure that they might have not realized that is just the vent hole for the brush so the rubber can collapse and uncollapse as you brush your hair (so the bristles can confirm to your head better.Another comment on the flaking gloss, maybe it could be caused by using the brush in the shower? I think it would be a bad ide because of that reason and eventually the glue holding the rubber in place could possibly lose its hold and would eventually lead to it being ripped out (this has happened to me before with other brushes). Plus the brush might get moldy inside where the vent hole is (yuck!)Side note: the brush is smaller than expected... I didn't bother to try and process the demension pics included so whatever. Other than that it looks like it does in the pics besides the whole made in Germany thing... Maybe they changed the writing on the brush because technically it's not a 100% boar hair brush... Each bundle has a single nylon bristle.I'll be updating my experiences with the brush in maybe a week or two...Update:The brush word good at distributing natural hair oils and coconut oil. I've had it for almost 2 weeks and there has been NO loss to the brushes finish. I NEVER use it on wet hair nor do I use it in the shower. Also I don't store it in my hot steamy bathroom. So I think if you don't do that stuff either you won't have a problem concerning the finish.Once a week I clean the brush like this:1. I remove any hairs caught in the brush.2. I use a dry toothbrush to brush out dandruff from that have been caught in the bristles3. Then I wet the tooth brush with hot water and brush the comb the bristles to remove any left over dandruff. (Constantly rinsing the toothbrush)4. I mix warm water and a dollop of shampoo5. I dip the tooth brush in the water and combed the bristles to remove excess oil.6. Rinse with cool water7. Repeat steps 5 and 6. (Optional)8. Quickly dry the wood off getting the rim of the brush too.9. Lay the brush upside bristle side down on a rag in a well ventilated area over night. (Will include a pic)I will write one more update at the one month mark and again whenever the brush starts peeling.Update 10/9/15It will be a month of owning this brush in 2 days. It lost one bundle but I was able to put it back. It hasn't come out since. This brush works well in my hair and in my step sister's hair (unlike my hair, hers is thin and naturally straight). There has still been no peeling. I personally am choosing to no clean it with a wet tooth brush so often. I'll be cleaning it dry as best I can because I think maybe cleaning it so often made the bristles come loose. October 2013: The ""extra gentle"" boar-bristle-with-nylon air-pillow brush is holding up (this is the one with the plastic handle in stead of the wood), that is, the bristles aren't sinking in.  (I can't comment on the life span of the replacement wooden one they sent, since I haven't been using it.)  The plastic handled one still tears my greying hair if I'm not careful, but not as much.  Overall, it was a bit of a hassle, but I did appreciate how the company handled the problem.April 2013: Contacted the company, with my receipt and pictures, requesting my money back.  They did not refund me, but they did respond promptly, saying they had never been contacted about this problem before, and offered to send me a replacement brush for free.  In the end they sent me an extra free brush as well--slightly different style (plastic base instead of wooden)--maybe they thought it would be more appropriate for my hair type and not tear as much? It was listed as ""extra gentle"".  We'll see how it holds up.March 2013:  The brush is now completely flat, with the central rings of bristles being super short or missing altogether (I got tired of constantly trying to pull them back up).  Consequently the brush catches and tears my hair instead of detangling it--I now, unintentionally, have bangs, which I didn't want.  If I can figure out how to upload pictures, I will.9-18-12 (original review date, but I accidentally put the review on their mini-brush I also bought, instead of here): On the plus side, I love how this brush feels on my head.  It's one of few brushes that successfully gets through my wavey, tangle-prone hair.  And it does so without creating static. (It does pull the wave out though--'wish it didn't.)On the down side, it's a little larger than my last brush--unnecessarily so, and to me a little too heavy.  The bigger issue though is that apparently there is nothing holding the bristles in place, so their much touted ""pneumatic"" feature (air ""pillow"" under the pink bristle pad) is just a hole that the bristles slowly sink into.  If I work at it, I can grab a hold of individual tufts and pull them back up, but of course they don't all come up evenly, and some of the individual bristles get accidentally pulled out, so doing that regularly--apart from the fact that I shouldn't have to--will significantly shorten the life-span of the brush.  We'll see how long this brush actually stays functional.  I've only had it a few months at this point.Also, there's an empty bristle tuft hole in each brush.  I worry that when I wash my brush (which I do every time I wash my hair) there is water getting in there which won't dry easily, and will eventually either rot out the brush or create a mold problem. Just speculation, but of concern.Next time I think I'll pay a bit more and get the other brand. I had one of those for years before it started breaking down.",1,5,-4

It's naturally wavy and a bit frizzy if I don't add heat to it, yet I have to almost talk dirty to it to get it to actually curl.  So in short, my hair ""type"" is all over the freakin place. Which, as you can imagine, makes it a bit difficult to find regular shampoos, never mind organic ones.  Anyways, I just ordered the shampoo version of the White Camelia Shampoo (and not the conditioner) I've used it twice now and it looked lovely on my hair away from my scalp but was too heavy for the hair near my scalp. Almost looking like i hadn't washed that part of my hair in a few days.  ( I have to wash my hair everyday if I want it to look clean, hence even more drying and damaging to the hair away from my scalp) Like I said, I liked the way it looked in the rest of my hair so I was contemplating using this as a conditioner instead (like one of the other users suggested) and not putting it near my scalp. So just like the other user I guess I'll have to go with a sulfate filled shampoo and this as the conditioner.  The idea of using a shampoo as a conditioner is so against my nature that I'm having problems bringing myself to do it. :D But I'll try that today and report back. I have curly, 3a type of hair, which is very dry. I wanted to use a organic shampoo because I've experienced bad results with some Sulfate shampoos, which leave hair dried out.  I gave this Aubrey Organics White Camellia shampoo and conditioner a first try! I was so exited, but when I used the shampoo, it felt kind of weird, It was leaving my hair with a hard feeling to it, and very tangled!!! I switched to organic shampoos because they are all natural and supposed to leave hair better than a Sulfate shampoo, but really, the sulfate shampoo I was using( peter copola, EVO shampoo) leaves my hair 100% better than this one, that gives a very hard texture to my hair which is normally soft with my sulfate shampoo.... So I then used the conditioner..and Aleluyaa! I'll never stop using the White Camellia Conditioner!!!! I mean it, its is a miracle in a bottle! That thing really did what no other conditioner in my life had ever done! It slipped so fast in my hair, made disappear the horrible tangles that the White camellia shampoo did, and my hair was left soo silkyyy!!! It even felt like I had a lot less hair in my head, it left it soo soft I didn't even had to use a Treatment for dry hair that I was using before! So I am still in search for the best organic Shampoo...but I already found the best organic Conditioner! :) I recomend, don't buy this shampoo, but buy the Conditioner, its amazing for dry hair!! I can feel the difference- my hair doesn't feel 'stripped'. I used a good amount the first time I washed my hair only because it doesn't leave your hair the way a normal shampoo would leave your hair so I didn't know if my hair was 'clean' or not. But I used a lot so I figured it would be clean but I guess that's a feeling I have to get used to after using this shampoo. I think this is the big difference between sulfate-free shampoo and shampoo with a sulfate product in it. The only problem with this is that the smell is kinda weird. I thought ""white camelia"" would smell fresh or pretty but the smell from washing my hair smelled like plastic. I don't know if all sulfate-free shampoos smell like this but there's other oils I use after to fix the smell but that was one thing I noticed that isn't ideal. This shampoo is the best product i have ever purchased over several years of being a natural. I am african american with Esperanza Spaulding hair type. This product does not strip my hair of the moisture it needs. In fact this product is extremely gentle and does not have anything that you cannot pronounce so i know this is a good product. I also use the honey suckle conditioner to detangle my hair. If i could give the product 10 stars it wouldn't be enough. I use to mix my own hair products with stuff in my house, but for the product life of buying real food to add to my hair, aubreys does the same thing...so as a frugal woman, i say its a good penny watcher product especially buying it from amazon compared to if i go to the organic food stores to get something of great quality for less the pennies :-) This is the new/reformulated shampoo from Aubrey organics which doesn't work even close to the original formula.  It's such a shame that all of the products were reformulated after Aubrey, the owner died.  I used their original  products for decades because they were the cleanest product on the market. They were so clean that they didn't hurt the environment when going down the drain.  I no longer use anything in the line because the company reformulated the products using unnatural ingredients. If this shampoo was sold as ""lightweight conditioner"" instead of shampoo, then I may have given it five stars.  However, this did not work for me at all as a shampoo ... and I normally love Aubrey products.  In short, over the course of two weeks of using this product, my hair became increasingly oily, clumpy, and dirty looking ... ick.  Maybe it's my own fault for not initially checking the ingredients:  At least five of the 14 ingredients are oils.  No kidding, oils.  I agree with the other reviewer that reported that this makes hair feel crunchy, while in contrast, Aubrey's conditioner is awesome.  For now I have returned to using my good-old shampoo (with sulfates) and will use up this Aubrey shampoo by applying to only the ends of my hair, like a follow-up conditioning rinse. Been using for many years; however, they may have changed ingredients some..I might be having a slight allergic reaction to...Not sure, but haven't found another product yet. This product is only okay. It's a wee bit pricier than I would like and you need to use a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean. Some days it still seems to be flat, greasy and weighed down more than with most shampoos. I would love to find a natural product that works, but this one is too much for my fine hair. I like Aubrey Organics and I will likely try one of their other formulas next.",1,3,-2

thought you should see/know how it arrived. Thankfully it’s encapsulated, but this is a bit dangerous. Update May 2, 2013: used product for a month (April 5 - May 2 (Friday will be 4 weeks)) and have had an inch of hair growth, an a lot more new hair growth, soft manageable hair. I used the straightener the first time in a couple months on Monday (April 20), and the hair at the ends remained soft to the touch. I recommend this product and will continue to use and monitor the hair growth. Sorry such a long review but feel it can be helpful to others.I was going to wait for a month to leave this review, but feel have to do it now. I have been using this for 1.5 weeks. I purchased after watching you tube videos as I want my hair to grow long and strong. I have long hair and cut myself at home, wear clip in extensions, and color my hair. My hair is still healthy, but my scalp is itchy. It does not feel dry and I do not have dandruff, just an itchy scalp. I also use Garnier Fructis Moroccan oil. I understand the best stuff to use is 100% natural oil, but living on a budget opted for this product.Pluses: great for relieving dry scalp, leaves hair soft and manageable, can be used several days (unless using a lot), hair has grown some also, not much but has.Negatives: can leave hair greasy, hard to wash out (if use to much), certain shampoos do not wash it out, and said to dry hair (I did not have this issue). Please read on and will tell you how I use it and how to wash it out easily.I do not use it like the you tube videos state. I use during the week, because unemployed and go to school online and do not use over the weekend due to when I go out and shop.1. Start Sunday with it (morning if not going anywhere, if so Sunday night). I use a dime size amount and go through the ends first and then just use the rest and massage the scalp. Starting at the top (middle part and to the crown and underneath towards the back and sides, and then comb through, it can feel greasy and look like it it starting to get greasy. My hair does not look greasy, however does feel greasy at the roots and the ends.2. I then put a braid in hair until ready to go to bed, take out comb, and go to bed3. Monday I wash out, before doing this I will ad more using the method stated above, will braid hair and do my cleaning (however by this time it will feel greasy and look greasy). Before getting my bath/shower I will take braid out and comb hair.4. Washing the product out, I will put head underwater and massage scalp first. Get my shampoo and wash out, however if your shampoo looses its lather, you will need to wash a second time. If you have used way to much, it will take an extra day to get completely out and washing it 2X, although it does not look to greasy your can feel it and will be conscious of it.5. After washing and rinsing for the 2nd time, I add conditioner as usual, starting at my ends and then working through the scalp and the length of hair. Rinsing the conditioner out is the last thing I do before getting out of bath/shower.6. I comb hair wet after dressing and towel drying the ends. I know they say not to comb hair wet, I like to and use wide tooth comb and gentle if any knots. Although usually no knots and hair looks great, scalp feels good, hair is shiny and very soft.After hair is 90 percent dry I use the Garnier Fructis Moroccan oil starting at the ends and ad to scalp (should use just a small amount or this can make the hair look greasy). Comb and I am done, unless sometimes use straighter, because I have a tiny bit of wave.7. Repeat these steps on Tuesday and Thursday. Wash hair on Friday and then do nothing on the weekend with due to going out and shop. Sunday begins my routine. However you will have to adjust and work out your own routine or what is best for you. Forgot to mention my hair type is very fine, however told by several hair dressers in the past I have a lot for it being fine. Use to getting the bigger container I adore this oil! in just three weeks my hair has gone from frizzy, stringy and full of knots to soft and sleek. I can go all day with my hair down on a windy afternoon without brushing my hair and can finger through it without a single snarl. The only thing I dont like is that it hasnt seemed to add any thickness to my hair like some people have experienced so I dont know if I need to just wait longer or I dont get that benefit. This is how I use it:I wash my hair on Sunday morning and that night after its totally dry I apply it to my scalp and ends rubbing it in. I think hit it with a blow dryer on high heat for about 30 seconds just to melt the oil and get it to really soak into my scalp and hair. I then wash my hands and face really well, using a strong toner around my hair line to help prevent any breakouts since a lot of reviews I saw before using this said it can cause bad under the skin painful breakouts. I throw it up in a bun and sleep on it. I then wash my hair every day for about 3 or 4 days until its out of my hair. I pair it up with Orangix Volume shampoo and Biolage Metrix conditioner (the best on the planet). The days I dont have the oil in my hair I dont wash it every day but get it wet and apply argon oil all over my hair (avoiding about 2"" from my scalp since I have naturally pretty oily hair). Repeat each week.I also use it every day on my eyebrows by first brushing my brows with an old toothbrush to help stimulate the area then use a que-tip to apply all over rubbing it in and really focusing on the thinner areas. I have seen a huge improvement in my brow growth and a lot of friends have commented on how great they are looking!I would totally recommend this to anyone looking to repair their hair, really condition it, and help resolve any bare spots in their brows!I also bought this exact product from Amazon and got it within 3 days!

I love the hinged vent for easy cleaning and the attachments work great though they do sometimes fall off. Dries hair super quick (and I have thick thick hair) and leaves it soft, shiny, and silky smooth, I am replacing with a different model that locks the attachments. The only drawback is that it does not have a hanging loop. I don't know why!! It works but I would not buy it again.  That's not to say it would be good for someone else.  I've had many men's hair dryers over the years and they seem to keep upping the wattage.  This one is 1875 watts, that is overkill to me.  Way back in the 70's when I was a teenager the men's hair dryers were about 500 watts and they worked fine and I had a lot more hair back then too!!  To have all that wattage it doesn't get very hot on the low setting, certainly not as much as any other hair dryer I have ever owned in the last 50 years! This works sooooo well.  I'm amazed how quickly it will dry my thick hair.  My only criticism is when you attach the brush and the dryer heats up, the brush easily falls off and you have to be careful as to how you use it.  Otherwise it is excellent. I cannot manage a dryer without a brush attached.  I'm not coordinated enough to dry my hair with a hairbrush in one hand and dryer in the other.  I have used this particular brand for years and like that it dries quickly.  However, it can over heat and shut off, so I stop every couple minutes and use the cool shot to cool it off.  It is inexpensive and will last for years using it in this manner. This dryer is good for the price. The attachments are nice but could be better quality. The drying power could be stronger. It's lightweight & travels easily. This blow dryer works really well to dry and lengthen 4C hair. It doesn’t get supper straight , but it’s enough if you need stretched hair for a style. This is a replacement for one I’ve had for years. I don’t think it was the same brand but it was the same style. This hair dryer met all my expectations and performed exactly as I had envisioned. Great buy. I've been using this hair dryer for many many years I won't use anything else i had to replace the old one because I  kept dropping it eventually motor made noise (my fault not the manufacturers) it's great. I recommend it",2,4,-2

I recently decided to try the product for myself as an adult and it seems to work great. Moisturizing, easy to use and smells nice. I have locs so a moisturizer that is not too heavy is essential. A bit on the pricey side in my opinion, but it lasts and works well. I can go for a simple wash n go with this leave in.This product worked for me but not my daughter. Different hair textures will have different results I have used this product for years. It’s perfect for my hair. I am African American and get perms. It’s really good at keeping it soft and manageable without breaking off. I recently colored my locs and my stylist told me to order this for max moisture. I really like this for my hair. Its very lighweight.  This lightweight consistency may cause an issue for others but for my locs its perfect. I love that this has aloe in it as well. I have been using this at least 2x a week and applying to the bottom half (where the color is) and I see a difference. My hair is not dry or brittle. Its not heavy and the smell isnt bad at all. It just dawned on me to add some tea tree + rosemary oil for scalp application.  The price is also very affordable I originally heard about this moisturizer through YouTube and decided to give it a try. I have a dry, itchy, scalp and it gets worse when I have a sew in and I've been trying different products to see which one would relieve the itch. I'm so happy I got this because my scalp barely itches anymore. I would recommend putting this in an applicator bottle or spray bottle if you use it on your scalp during a sew in/braids. I put this in a applicator bottle, filled it to about 2 oz and added like 5 or 6 drops of peppermint drops to it, shook it up and applied it to my scalp. The cooling sensation from the peppermint oil feels so good on my scalp! The product alone with no peppermint oil works, but after 4 hours or so, my scalp began to itch. I recommend adding a few drops of peppermint oil to this moisturizer. Your hair will not itch for days. Maybe a little scratch here or there, but it's worth it. I love this product and will definitely be purchasing again! Nothing Product works well. You should have a old shirt, or towel when you apply it to your hair. A spray bottle reduces spills. I have used this product for years.  It is especially wonderful for dry, brittle and damaged hair, especially as the seasons change.  It leaves my hair soft, repairs split ends and promotes hair growth.  It smells great and leaves no flaky residue on hair.  I will continue to use this product after each shampoo.",1,4,-3

I must engrain that reality into your brain before you make expectations about color, and then become disappointed when your hair doesn't take on the same tone and intensity as person A, B, or C.I give Light Mountain 5 stars, because I've used it several times and was never disappointed by its quality nor the color it produced in my hair. It's also an inexpensive and physically non-harmful way to color hair if you so wish to do so. It gave the length of my hair some noticeable conditioning benefits, and if I was planning to continue to change the color of my hair, then I would certainly consider using Light Mountain henna. *It also didn't fade, which could be good or bad depending on how you felt about its color on yourself*-- which is why if you're a newbie to henna, you're really taking a leap! I'll get more into that later..In terms of the Bright Red color on myself: on a dark, neutral blonde head of hair the color turned out exactly as promised-- it was bright red, intense, and vibrant (in my opinion, excellent if that's what you're going for). Also and fortunately for my cool-toned skin, the red was cool and not warm, therefore the color didn't wash out my complexion (I'll try to post a picture if I find one so you can see what I'm talking about). This is where I'm going to get into talking about henna, and what I wish I may have thought about and/or considered before I used it on myself, especially being a natural blonde. So now that I'm growing out my henna:..For all of you blondes/light brunettes out there-- first of all I see that a lot of you (including myself in the past) feel like you need to change your hair color, because it's not bright ""enough"" or rich ""enough"" in color. I want to say that that is not true, and more than likely *positively* your natural color is best suited for you. No matter the color or shade of our skin and hair *all of us* are beautiful the way we are. Truly, I mean it.. and maybe that's because I have experienced changing myself. Even just changing hair color, to me, is a way to not fully accept what it means to be you-- and, I've learned that even by using henna. Maybe Light Mountain has given me wisdom? Haha. Not to get too philosophical..My final comment based on my experience is as follows: if you decide that you definitely want to use henna, first of all, remember that it is a COMMITMENT. I can't stress that enough. If you don't like the color, then you are going to be really disappointed to find out that there is not much you can do to get it out. No, really. You essentially have to grow it out or cut it off if you want to stay natural. This is an even bigger bummer I believe for those of us who have long hair and are attached to it, because it's going to take so long for you to get that length back and have no henna in your hair. Henna, (*here is a note, especially for light-haired folks-- blondes to med. brunettes) is going to leave you with a fiery orange tone in the sun. It may sound pretty at first, but in my experience, having saturated (emphasis on saturated-- you will no longer really have any natural high-lights) red-orange hair in the sunlight against my very cool eyes, eyebrows, and facial complexion did not look nice.. I should say it doesn't look nice, because I'm still mostly a henna head. Personally, I do not recommend red henna on blondes-med brunettes who have cool skin and eyes. I think you'd look much better with your natural color, and you could add in some honey lightening to fulfill the need in giving your hair some variety.12 blue prints.com had a great article for women of my complexion, who are referred to as ""soft summers""- ""you are not sunshine, you are the welcoming relief of shade""You do not have to brighten your blonde or be red.But, my review doesn't really matter in the sense that.. if you want to henna, you are just going to do it anyway! :D Thanks guys. My first use of this product ( bright red) and I am hooked. What's not to love?I have been trying to get this color for years and now I've found it! Plus it's all natural with no chemicals. My hair looks and feels amazing.First off, don't let the videos scare you, this is no harder to use than any off the chemical dyes. Just add distilled water.It is a little time-consuming, you have to mix it and then let it set for at least an hour. I let it sit for about 2 and 1/2 hours, and then I left it in my hair for another 2 hours. But I absolutely love the results it even colored the hard to color gray around my hairline at the temples.My hair is medium thick and medium length just blow my shoulders. I used half a box and had plenty left over. So I'm thinking that I can easily get three treatments a box in the future. I like the nice creamy texture. And I've read in the reviews that a lot of people have commented on the smell, but I actually like it it's kind of rich and earthy.I highly recommend this product and I know that I will definitely be coming back for more. Thank you light mountain I am a natural redhead with auburn red hair, and I really wanted to brighten up my natural red hues without using those harsh chemical dyes. I am also pregnant, so I needed something that was safe enough to use during pregnancy. I stumbled upon henna dye when I was reading a Cosmo magazine and they mentioned how to brighten up your natural hair with Henna. So I did A LOT of research, watched endless tutorials, and even did a strand test before getting fully started just to make sure it was the color I wanted! I decided on ""Light Mountain Natural in Bright Red"" since the color is similar to my natural highlighted red hues. The process was fairly easy, especially with the detailed instructions that comes with this product. I mixed about 2 1/2 tbsp of Henna, 1 egg, and hot filtered water. The egg provides your hair more moisture, and gives it a bit of a different texture. I let the Henna cure for about 1 hour before using it (place a clear bag or wrap over henna mixture since the heat helps to cure it faster). Once that was done curing I mixed the henna until it was a nice consistency and sectioned my hair and applied. It is MESSY, but it didn't stain my countertops right away, only your CLOTHES! Make sure you wear something you don't care for. Also, I would advise anyone to put vaseline or any greasy product along their facial hair lines, ears, neck, etc. I left the dye in for 45 minutes using the plastic hair cap provided by LMN and added heat from my blow dryer. I immediately jumped in the shower and rinsed out the henna with luke warm water and conditioner. I don't like using shampoo's since they strip your hair from it's natural oils and leave my scalp feeling dry and frizzy! I ""water wash"" and condition. If you prefer to use shampoo make sure it is free of sulfates, and any major chemicals. Use a very gentle shampoo or water and baking soda mixture to cleanse your scalp. NOW, for the RESULTS!....I was nervous at first since my hair did look a bit darker, but when I blew it out...OMG my hair LOOKED BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! It certainly gives you a BRIGHT beautiful RED color!! It didn't look patchy, it wasn't SUPER red...it was EXACTLY what I wanted! So...do I recommend this product? ABSOLUTELY!! If you are looking for a more permanent and natural look this is it! It's 100% organic and cruelty free to animals. I read the ingredients and there is nothing questionable to be considered. I think this product deserves a better rep! TRY IT OUT LADIES!!!!!!!! Hope you get fantastic results! I will try and post a pic!",1,4,-3

I was living and working in a high stress environment and my hair was falling out in bunches. Once of my employees (who has beautiful hair) gave an almost full bottle that she uses in her hair. I fell in love, the smell is great and it actually relieved my psoriasis that I have in the back of my scalp. In about a week I started seeing a difference in my hair, it was getting thicker, shiner, and it wasn't falling out. Once I finished the bottle that my employee gave me, I tried to find places where I can buy it from, silly me didn't look on Amazon, so I went 3 years without using this product. My hair didn't fall out as much as before but it still fell out. I used so many products, like Kronos Shampoo and products which are awesome, but very expensive, so I had to stop using it because I couldn't cough up $50 a month on Shampoo. But those who can, believe me, try it! Anyways this is about Alter Ego Revitalizing Lotion, as I was saying, even thou my hair wasn't falling out in chunks my psoriasis came back and with avenges, since I didn't have the Alter Ego Revitalizing anymore I was always itching and flaking. A few weeks back just browsing on Amazon I come across Alter Ego Revitalizing (mind you that I have looked for this on the internet and even thou I did find it, no one would ship to Puerto Rico), I was so happy, I tried to order with another seller but same story, ""We Don't Ship To Puerto Rico"", I saw this seller and expecting to hear again the story of my life,I ordered and to my surprise my product was at my mail box in a few days, wrapped neatly in bubble wrap. I was so happy! Finally someone who delivered and cheaper than their competitors and shipped FOR FREE!!! Awesome! I immediately started using this product and in a week again, I started seeing a difference! Again flaking, dryness and itchiness is down to a minimum to a point that I don't scratch in front of people anymore. Now once I am done with my bottle I will definitely order again. This is great stuff! I've been using this since March 2012 andSpeaking of growth, I did a Big Chop in Feb 2012 BECAUSE MY EDGES CAME OUT FROM A BAD QUICK WEAVE, and began using Alter Ego in March 2012 but I can't tell 100% if it's the main reason of my hair growth. In May, my hair grew long enough for me to get braids, which I'm currently wearing. I massage Alter Ego in my scalp once a week and I also use it after each shampoo. My hair has been growing faster than I expected so, I have to credit Alter Ego for PART of the growth since this is the ONLY product I'm using in my hair. I'm assuming if you use it consistently, it will work GREAT. Some say this doesn't have the greatest smell but I actually like it.IF YOU ALL KNOW OF ANYTHING ELSE I COULD USE WITH IT, LET ME KNOW, THANKS. I started to use it 2 weeks ago, I bought this product because I read that it helps with blod spots and with hair lost, I have bold spots and I haven't seen any hair growing but I guess it doesn't work on everyone the same. What I can say is that the hair lost stopped, I'm not loosing hair like I used to and I love the feeling that it leaves on the hair after you use it. It doesn't leave you with a oily texture and after applying the lotion you can style as desire. I will continue to use it because I think 2 weeks isn't enough to really see results. Me agrado todo I bought this product in combination with the Alter Ego Garlic treatment & the hairspray. After reading all the positive reviews along with some personal recommendations I'm giving this a try. I've only used it once so i cannot attest to the whole ""miracle in a bottle"" thing just yet but I can say my hair looked a lot healthier after I took it to the salon and had them treat my hair with it. I also felt the lotion stimulating my scalp with a tingling sensation as the stylist applied it. Don't know if that's a good thing or what, but like i said, it was only the first treatment. I plan on treating my hair every week with this so I'll provide an update when I'm halfway through the bottle!Wish me luck! Been using this since January into February when the hair-braider pulled my hair pluck bald (in the back of head) I had to treat my scalp for trauma of infection and scabs ewww!!!! Alto ego lotion is natural, healed my all of my scalp and the traumatic area, took two bottles for the site to grow in with in three months.  With use of Garlic shampoo, great conditioner and my favorite herbal hair grease great outcome.  Patience is the key with this product....I still use it to help continue the hairsite at three inches and a great leave in conditioner.Thank you again My aunt recommended I try this because she uses it on her hair and her hair is beautiful and long. So since I'm trying to grow it out I bought it too. After I washed my hair I put 5 drops because I was following my aunts advice not to put to many drops because it can penetrate your pores and it leaves you tasting anything you place on your hair in the back of your throat like an after taste. So doing so I blow dried my hair and style it with a flat iron.I usually have frizzy out of control hair even after styling it but it has changed dramatically and I'll keep trying it to see if there are anymore changes. My hair was long (middle of my back) however I was transitioning from a relaxer to natural and suffered a lot of breakage.  My beautician recommended Alter Ego Revitalizing Lotion to help strengthen my hair and stop the breakage.  Every week after I get my hair wash she applies it to my scalp. It stings a bit but it helped a lot. I recently cut my hair (to the nape of my neck) and even though my hair is healthy I continue to use the lotion. I believe the products I use including the lotion greatly helps with maintaining the health of my hair.  I love Alter Ego and their products; this is no exception.",2,4,-2

It also has a very nice sweet perfume-like smell.  My only complaint is that the bottle itself is not designed very well - it's great if you're just using it in your home, but you definitely could not travel with this product easily, as the nozzle would likely open and leak. i have had so many complements on how shiny my hair is Did not work to well with my hair.  Gave to my daughter and she loved it!  My hair is really thick and dry that could be why. I like to wash my hair daily, but it ends up dry and frizzy, especially during the winter months. I've used a few products that helped me manage my hair (pomades, gels, etc.), but they usually tend to weigh down my hair, or leave it feeling dirty. When I first heard about FX Silk Drops Serum, I had to give it a try. Why not? I've tried everything else. The first few times I applied it, I put a bit too much in my hair and it ended up feeling very oily. I finally figured out how much to use, and now I love it. After I wash my hair, I put a tiny amount - about the volume of a pea - into my hands and spread it through my hair. After a couple of minutes it has absorbed and doesn't feel oily at all. Instead, it feels soft and silky smooth, and is much more manageable. I'm happy to have found this product. It does help control the frizzes but be careful because it just takes a little bit. I've found it better to put on right after I get out of the shower because it is easier to work into the hair more evenly when wet but that's probably a personal preference. I have longer hair than most and it has lasted a long time. If you live in a humid area you should give this a try. No matter where you live or what type hair,this stuff simply makes it feel wonderful. I can tell when I use it and when I don't. It looks and feels better when I use it.......just go easy, I have thick long hair and I pour less than a quarter size ""drop"" in my palm. Try a dime size drop to begin with and work it in. Exactly what I needed? Love it always. I use smoothing serums a lot. I bought this and a few curling gels/creams of the same brand. I was very disappointed with the other products from this brand, but this one I was pleasantly surprised. Smells good and does the trick, smooths down hair and you do not need that much of it to get the job done :)",5,3,2

I prefer this one as it does not leave your hair shining NOR overly sticky with its application.  I will say that the longer your hair is...the more product you need to apply.  It also does not perform great if your hair is too short, meaning a happy medium should be attained for this to work its best. It's best used in moist hair but not WET or totally dry hair.Pros: great cost, not super sticky, dries fast, is not very shiny, has a tolerable/pleasant smell to it (not like some others)Cons: hard to find this product sometimes It is okay but still is not as good as the Lock It that  L'oreal you discontinued. muy bueno A quality putty especially for fine hair. Great hold, invisible feel. This does what I need it to do.  And in a market where each different hair product seems to go up everytime you need a new batch of it, this has stayed reasonable. I usually buy this in the store but can’t seem to find it lately. Texture is slightly different but barely noticeable. Good value for the money! This is definitely a price performer, and it is what it says it is... light weight.I'm used to using the Great Clips Pliable Putty Medium Hold Pomade, which is a heavier, and holds short hair in place much longer. This product will for sure look great for an hour or two or longer if you remain indoors, but once you go outdoors, especially in wind, it has zero holding power for being able to run your hands back through your short style, and look halfway decent again.  You will be back to a 'natural' dandelion zero hold look quickly. I’ve ordered this before a while back and it was delivered just fine. This time not so much. I can’t tell if it is half empty, already opened, or melted to one side??? Last time I ordered it was full to the top  and the putty was flat. This time it is all slanted and seems like a lot less product. Either or, it should still work the same. The product itself works great but the look of it when first opened leaves a bad first impression. Not sure if I was shorted or if the putty melted and hardened again in a weird way.",2,4,-2

Depending on the texture of your hair, a little goes a long way. I've been using this in my natural hair and curly wig for many years. Not greasy and it keeps the curls soft. I like the way it looks and feels In my hair. have been using for a couple months now and I can say it’s been one of the best products i’ve ever used. For years i’ve been looking for a leave-in conditioner for curly hair and finally came across this. First off it smells amazing. Defines your curls and leaves your hair so smooth silky and soft. And it doesn’t leave your hair crunchy or flaky!!!",4,5,-1

It's been a great shampoo.  I alternate between this and John Masters products. This shampoo really helps loosen the scalp flecks so you can remove them and keep the itching of psoriasis under control. This is my favorite shampoo. I dislike most scented shampoos, but this one I like. It also works very well as a shampoo. One of the best shampoos for dread locks on the market !!!! This is our ""go to"" shampoo and has been for years. We love the way it cleans and the fresh feel and smell in your hair. So far so good.  I've been using this for a few weeks now and I have not had any issues with dandruff or flaking. My hair seems healthy, and I enjoy the smell.  It is not too overpowering, but gives a nice jolt of minty freshness in the morning.  My only complaint is the bottle design. It's hard to see the product as you pour it out due to the design of the cap, and while the bottle was nearly full it seemed to always dispense too much shampoo. Aside from that it's been great. Like most shampoos containing peppermint/tea tree oil, this one soothes my itchy scalp.  (My stylist says my scalp isn't dry or diseased; probably just allergic to sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates).  And like most tea tree oil shampoos, when this shampoo gets on your face, it gives a light burning sensation.  I find that Giovanni's Tea Tree Triple Threat Shampoo's burn is stronger and lasts longer than those of other tea tree shampoos I've tried, even when I take care not to get much on my face.My friend, whose skin is very sensitive and allergic to most things, does not react aversely to Giovanni's, though she has the same trouble with the light burning feeling on her face.I'd recommend it for itchy scalps, but beware the light burning on the skin of your face, especially around your eyes. Good shampoo, packaging has improved.",2,5,-3

Smells good, makes your hair feel nice, great for curls. My wife purchased the Tea Tree conditioner two years ago for Christmas. Wow! I am blown away with how it makes my hair feel. Super soft and no tangles. I have long curly hair so this is a must for me. I love the smell and I get great results from using only a small amount. This is my second bottle so for me it lasted about a year. My wife uses it on occasion too and she enjoys it as well. I also have the Tea Tree Shampoo which is amazing but that is for another review. I highly recommend this conditioner. I’ve used the shampoo and conditioner for years. It is awesome and I highly recommend these products from Paul Mitchell.

I was having trouble maintaining moisture in my hair. I have tried various other products (some that were rather expensive!) that resulted in initial moisturizing, but a couple hours later my hair would feel quite parched. I decided to give this a try and I do not regret it!! I've only been using for about two weeks (daily usage), but my hair already feels so much softer and moisturized. Furthermore, I haven't shed as much hair nor have I had as much breakage as I normally do. I even enjoy the smell, but it might not be for everyone. Anyways, I would definitely recommend this for ladies with a similar hair type. Used this for years, become hard to find in stores. Was so relieved I can buy it here. Love it!! I used to use this product on my hair since I was a teenager. Good stuff This is such a great product - works well, smells great,INCREDIBLE value for money, and ships free with Amazon.My hair is curly and I've been trying to find a leave-in for a long time that would help tame my frizzies before regular styling but also help my hair feel and look hydrated on days when I want to give it a break from styling products. THIS IS EXCELLENT.It's the first product I've used in a long time that has actually WORKED to control the frizz. I have hair just below my shoulder, curly/wavy- I use a dime size of this all over and a little on the places that frizz more, then I style as usual (mouse) and let it air-dry or diffuse if in a rush. the result is FABULOUS. Perfectly curled hydrated and bouncy coils with absolutely no frizz! This bottle will last me months and my hair hasn't looked or felt this great in a while. I recommend it for women with curly/wavy and dry hair.  I’ve head everything in the ingredients list after phenooxyethenol by law has to be 1% or less.  My bottle has it as the third ingredient with a long list following.  Another reviewer didn’t even list phenooxyethenol as an ingredient !  Besides which it’s two days since I purchased this and the price went up almost $2.  And the newer ingredients are worse.  I’ll be returning it. I used this in my daughters 3A hair. Her hair falls out way too much. I can already see a huge difference after a couple uses. Much less shedding. It feels soft for a while. I’d definitely buy again!",5,4,1

I would have to say this product is in my top 3. My hair is generally coarse and dry. It seemed like no matter what leave in i would use, it would work for awhile, but I would be back where I started. I did some research about Dominican products. Since I previously had sucess with other products I figured it might work well because of the placenta in it. I was right! This is a wonderful product! I am 3 months post texlax and in some places i have over 2 inches of new growth. Normally with this much growth I would have a hard time. This product makes my hair soooo soft I have to keep my hair braided to keep from manipulating my hair. I can barely stop touching it lol. This product also smells great. I would definitely recommend this to friends, which I already have. I used to buy this from a salon in Brooklyn and haven’t been able to find it. This makes my hair so soft and easy to detangle. Will be buying more. I've been using this product since my hairdresser introduced me to it years ago. It doesn't leave residue, or make your hair oily. Highly recommend. This was ordered for my sister she just received it so its to early yet to give it a 5 star review. Her hair is dry lifeless and brittle, this product so far has provided softness durability and manageability , no shine yet as she hoped but maybe after prolonged use that may appear. Please check back later for a review update. My wife loves it and can say that it’s the best thing out there Brillo y suavidad al cabello asegurada No vi con exactitud la etiqueta del envase, creía que estaba comprando champú que es lo que realmente necesito y resultó ser acondicionador.

This is the #1 product by far! The other gel/mousse either are too weak to hold up hair, or they leave tiny white flakes when they dry (sometimes both). This product avoids all of that and just holds up hair with a completely natural look. Air drying leaves a natural look and running your hand through your hair after it dries helps to keep a natural look to avoid clumping. This doesn't have the firmest holding power for keeping your hair up all day, but it doesn't advertise to do that either.In addition to all of this, it is all natural. There aren't any harmful chemicals, and above all, NO ARTIFICIAL FRANGRANCES!! This is so important, as artificial fragrances are extremely prevalent and are known to be harmful. I'll definitely be sticking with Giovanni for hair product in the future! This product does a great job at giving my fine hair lift, and it holds throughout the day. I put it on roots and blow dry for lift. Or scrunch on ends and let air dry for some waves. It’s not very shiny. Has a more natural finish. Gave it four stars for the smell. I have a very picky nose! I have shoulder length hair with long layers.  My hair texture is a mix of some curly/some straight - so just a mixed bag of lifelessness if I do nothing.  Just a quarter size dollop of this mousse worked to puff up my hair just from an air dry and then to higher proportions using a blow dryer.My routine is as follows to get the best from your products if you suffer from lifeless hair:1.  Wet hair thoroughly2.  Take only a quarter size of shampoo, rub your hands together and gently massage your scalp.3.  Get some water on your head to create a lather4.  Do not lather your ends5.  Let the water run through your hair until it runs clean6.  Take a cup of half apple cider vinegar and half water and lightly work it through your hair7.  Rinse your hair8.  It should feel ""squeaky"" which means that your hair is clean (if you use a lot of product, be sure to use a little more shampoo/vinegar until you achieve the squeak.  I do not condition because my hair is not dry.  I tend to have well-balanced natural moisture in my hair.  Lightly condition the ends if you need to and rinse thoroughly.9.  Gently squeeze dry your hair10.  Wait until your hair is lightly dry naturally or lightly dry with blow dryer11.  Take the quarter size mousse into your fingers, not palms.  Rub together your fingers and lightly work it through your hair starting at the roots.12.  Continuously fluff your hair with your fingers if you are air drying or now begin using the blow drier to lift it the way you wantThis routine has worked great for me for a long time.  I hope it works for you.  Less is more. My new favorite product!! Lightweight, not sticky, adds volume to my hair, does not make my hair feel heavy and sticky. Doesn’t even feel like the product is in my hair yet my hair holds a curl so much better than with out it! This seemed to dry out my hair. It also just didn't give the hold I thought it would, even if I used a ridiculous amount (which made my hair drier). I have low density very fine curly hair. So long as a product doesn't weight it down, it usually holds well. Not this mousse,  Not the product for me. Good for volume on fine hair. Light weight I like it all",3,5,-2

shampoo work well better expensive shampoo,"Dove Nutritive Solutions Sulfate-Free Color Care Shampoo for Color Treated Hair Color Protect Lasting Color Vibrancy 12 oz, Pack of 6","This shampoo is nice. It makes my hair super soft and smells really good. I haven’t noticed nearly the amount of fading as I did with regular shampoo. The only thing is that due to it being sulfate free it doesn’t suds up as much as a shampoo with sulfates would which can be weird at first but it still cleans your hair well. I shampoo twice as well, and it foams more on the second wash. I love the product was disappointed that it spilled out in the box the whole bottle was empty With the price of everything going up. This is a great value to save money on everyday products. One bottle had no top on. Spilled everywhere That’s a wonderful price After COVID Pandemic, Dove reduced size and quality of the product,and they became way to watery for me to use. I found I end up needing to use more which defeat the purpose of cheaper economic value it had. Keeps my red hair bright and fresh I like anything from Dove, I may be a little prejudice,but the truth be told Dove has good products; makes hair very manageable and soft protects color from UV damage, little goes a long way.",1,4,-3

After reading all the reviews, I was excited to use it- I have thick curly hair that's really long, about halfway down my back, and takes forever to dry.  This towel is definitely nice and thin and soft- much softer than I expected, after having used my mom's versions of stuff like this years ago when I still lived at home.  And it is more absorbent than a regular bath towel by a good margin.  Where I'd used to get out of the shower, wrap my hair up, do my makeup, and then have to take the towel off to blow dry my hair before getting dressed, this towel is thin enough that I can leave it on while I'm getting dressed because it doesn't overstretch the necks of my tops.  When I pull my hair out, it is dryer than with a regular towel, although I do still have to hit it with the blow dryer for a little bit to get it dry enough to my liking to leave the house.It doesn't seem to do much for my curls- they've been a little on the frizzy side since I've started using this towel, which I can fix with a little hair serum, but it's something I didn't so much need to do with other towels and a diffuser attachment.Does this product save me time? Yes.  Is it a miracle product? No.  I like it and I'll continue using it, but I doubt I'll buy another.  Also, a word of caution if you dye your hair- the first day I used mine was three days and two shampoos after a color session, and it still sucked some color out of my hair, so now my white towel is stained with red.  This isn't a big deal to me because I don't really care what the towel looks like, but just something to know if you're a dye-er, use regular towels for a few shampoos after you dye.  And if your hair is much past your shoulders, you're going to want the big one- I can't imagine the smaller one would be anywhere near big enough to cover all my hair. This towel is quite thin, and great for packing in a workout bag.I use this towel to dry off after workouts at the gym. its so nice to have a non-bulky towel that dries quickly.What I typically do is after I workout and shower and dry off, I throw the towel in my workout bag when I head out to the car. When I get to the car, I pull the towel out and just lay it on top of my workout bag (I havent ever hung it up in the car). Keep in mind, this is December/January and so the heat in the car when I am in the office is nil. When I am done working for the day and head home, I usually hang it up when I get home in the bathroom or on a coat hook. By morning the towel is completely dry and not musty at all. If I were to do this with a regular towel, the towel wouldnt be completely dry and would start smeling funky.I have owned a few of these towels, in different sizes, and I am always impressed with the quality and the materials. It does take a bit of getting used to when you first dry off. It wont glide on the skin the way a normal cotton plush towel does, but thats easy to get used to and the fact that it does a great job of drying far outweighs the minor inconvenience of getting used to it.Bottom line is that I highly recommend this product. I have purchased a few more to take in the RV just to not have huge towels hanging around when I am traveling. No doubt they will work well. Its really is a great towel, I will most likely buy more.  I guess my skin is just a bit sensitive.. Its not like a fluffy towel, no great wrap of warmth and comfort when you get out of the shower.  If that's what your looking for your not going to get it.  It is a thin thin towel.  But it does work well regarding drying power.  It does work as they say. The Aquis lisse towels are the best I've ever owned. They absorb water quickly and dry faster than any other towel I've tried. They feel great and last forever. I bought some of these towel over seven years ago and they look the same as the ones that just arrived. Also, I have fine, curly hair and the smaller towels dry my hair really well without fraying or knotting it up. I take the smaller towels when I travel just for my hair. I love that all Aquis towels are thin and fold compactly in my luggage. I just wish they made a beach towel size, that would be perfect. But as long as Aquis keeps making towels, I will keep buying them. At first I didn't like this towel, and now I do. Upon receiving the item, I decided to use the towel the very next day without washing it, and was upset at first because I wanted this towel to accentuate my curls, since I was never able to see them when drying my hair with the regular body towels, since I have frizzy hair, so I gave it another try before giving up on it, but this time around I read the instructions prior to re-using it, and washed it, and boy was I wrong, somehow washing it helped and I was able to see my curls this time around. They seemed very defined. This towel picks up a significant amount of moisture from the hair thus, reducing time and making it faster to blow dry. I don't use this towel to dry my body with since I don't like the texture of how it feels. In my opinion, it feels a little rough so i'll stick to the regular body towels for my body, but for my hair it'll do. Blowing drying my hair use to take long. Now, this has become my go-to towel everywhere I go when needed. I would definitely recommend purchasing this towel if you don't like your hair taking up to much time.",4,4,0

No more matted down areas !!!Works great !!!!  Well made, sturdy - and no broken teeth after vigorous use !I just imagine it would be pretty good for someone with thick hair too :) Very sturdy & perfect for thick curly hair or to use on wigs. Very sturdy! Got the job done. Missing half of my hair now, but that's my fault for letting it get so tangled. 😅😂 Quarantined, 7 months pregnant, stay at home mom with a toddler. Messy buns are life. Have thick, curly, super easily tangled hair, and had a complete rat's nest going on. Took this baby into the shower and used a metric ton of conditioner, there was ripping, there was cussing, there were chunks of hair torn loose, and there was pain.... But it was worth it, the comb held up and is missing no teeth, and today, (with the help of this comb, my davines hair products, and a Denman brush after) my hair is silky smooth, and still about to my waist. Without needing a hair cut 😂 Yay!!! I wanted a hard rubber comb and this is plastic. I hear it crackling thru my 3a long hair when I tried to use it. I think best suited for short 4c type hair. First off- I absolutely love this product! Before buying this comb, I used to always brush my long, bleached hair out with a paddle brush and I would have so much hair fall-out from trying to tug through all the post-shower tangles in my damp/ towel dried hair. Now, my Diane comb hangs on a hook in my shower (very convenient hole in the brush handle for those of you who like to keep your styling tools in plain site) and after conditioning my hair I use the comb to work through tangles while still standing under the water. This helps to keep the hair smooth and it separates SO much easier for the comb. Feel free to imagine yourself as a mermaid sitting under a waterfall combing through your lovely long tresses at this point (I guess this would make you a lake mermaid, but don't get too caught up in the details). After getting all of the knots out I can safely towel dry my hair and then apply the ga-zillion products I use everyday - finally, one last comb through to make sure everything is evenly distributed. The comb is easy to wash off (it's just plastic after all) and should be cleaned after each use. Even on dry hair this is a great comb to detangle before brushing through with your bristle brush. Anyway, full stars for this awesome product!! <3 Looking for a wide tooth comb with a handle. Ordered this one and it is great. Nice handle is easy to hold on to and if you have short arms like I do it is great for combing the back of your hair. Seems like it will hold up to daily use. Very happy with this purchase. Not really sure what else to say. It is a wide tooth comb that I use in my shower to help detangle my wavy hair. It is gentle on my hair and does exactly what I need it to do. The price was great, and it arrived in a timely matter. If I need a new one I won't hesitate to buy this one again.",5,5,0

Jar","I use this about once a week. It works well. This was great for my hair which is a bit thin. This did not weighed my hair down and smelled good. I also liked the smell of the product and it didn't weigh my hair down. This product works great at conditioning my hair. It leaves it soft and manageable after washing. One of the rare products with chemicals that I use on my natural hair. I mailed this product to my friend and this company shipped the wrong item. She stated it did not have DPT on it as I needed. It was a hold cream instead. I was unpleased with item. Will not buy again from this company. Not just for coarse hair. This is the best conditioner for fine hair that can't handle heavy products. Left my hair light and bouncy. Wonderful I have super hair, even without product. But I find this is a great aid to having that shiny and manageable after wash look and feel I need and want. This is an incredibly thick conditioner. If you want ti to work right, wrap your hair with saran type wrap and put a towel around your head. (Better yet a real heated cap!) Let it sit as long as you have the patience and wash it out in the shower. It will take a long, long time to get it out of your hair. The work will pay off, because this leaves your hair looking and feeling fabulous. The contrast between before and after is stunning, especially if your hair is frizzy and looking like it's seen better days. This perked my hair right up, but I would not use it too frequently or it will start to leave your hair looking limp due to buildup. Recommended. A very good deep conditioner that produces amazing results for dry and damaged hair. Leaves hair moisturized and feeling healthy again.",2,4,-2

Ya que habíamos probado con muchos shampoo, para librarnos de la caspa y el cabello reseco. Este es un shampoo que te mantiene el cabello hidratado, y muy limpio. Muy recomendado 👍 🥰🌼 I can always count on this product to relieve dry scalp and itching. So much better than going to the store for I’ve been using this head and shoulders for years and when I got my double transplant the meds started to make my hair fall out and caused it to be dry and brittle. This shampoo not only restored my hair back to normal but it keeps it hydrated and helps my hair growth Good product I use this with a squirt of coconut oil almost everyday, most times morning and at night.  I’ve tried everything under the sun to get rid of dandruff including shower filters and this stuff works great.  My dad has the same condition as me and he uses it now too.One thing to remember is you must use cold water on your head, as much as it sucks it doesn’t suck as much as dandruff and I got to say you get used to it.  If you use hot water you are wasting your time and money, if you have any skin condition hot water will make it worse.I also have seborrheic dermatitis on my face and head which I use Promiseb (also only thing that works), I've used countless dandruff shampoos during my life, and this is my favorite so far. It might not work as well as some of the prescription strength ones I've gotten from my doctors, but those always smell terrible and are a hassle (you have to go back to the doctor when your refills run out). Plus with stinky ones, I always stop using them once the dandruff starts to clear up, which means it ends up coming back again. I have been using this product for almost three months now consistently since it smells nice and leaves my hair fairly soft and shiny. No dandruff problems during that time, even though the winter months are normally the worst for me, and my eczema is raging on my hands.And, my wife loves the smell of it, which is a big plus.I will update this post if the dandruff ever comes back while I am still using this product. Product arrived broken, with one bottle empty and the contents filling the package (not a pleasant surprise since my package included other items as well that I had to go through the process of cleaning). That being said, I love the smell of the product and it definitely does its job. No more dandruff, although it does make my hair more greasy than I’m used to, which is saying something because I have incredibly thick curly hair. If I purchase again I’d try out a different type and try to purchase in store.",1,5,-4

Backstory: I went to get my haircut. They said that I was damaging my hair because I put it up everyday when I run. After my haircut, they put this frizz serum on my hair which made it INCREDIBLY soft. I found out what it was. It was INCREDIBLY expensive. We're talking $35 for a month's supply. I scoffed at that.So, I did some research on the best rated hair serums and anti-frizz products. This was rated pretty high, and I got a great price so I gave it a shot. I love it!!! It is a lotion, which caught me off guard. I know it says it is a lotion, but I failed to read that part. I assumed I was getting a serum. Even with that, I am still very impressed. I think the lotion makes this a better product. I use it everyday and can tell a HUGE difference from before I used it. I put it in wet hair after my shower in the evenings. My hair stays soft and less-frizzy all the next day. It did take a couple of days of testing to get the right amount. Having almost waist length thick hair, I use one and a half pumps. I will definitely buy this product again. For the price and the way it works, it is a FANTASTIC value. I love this product!  I'm heartbroken they aren't making it anymore.  Glad I could find this  - not ready to give it up yet! I originally got this at a local drug store because I needed something to control frizzies and thick hair (my Grandma recommended this). I did not realize until I got another bottle of this last Christmas that there are two versions of this in the same color bottle and everything. I origionally had the ""smoothing"" one and for Christmas I got the ""leave-in conditioner."" What the heck!Once I found out they were two differnet things, I had to compare. The ""smoothing"" one is thick and only controls 50% off the frizzies and 3/4 of my hair is smooth.The ""leave-in conditioner"" is liquidy and controls 100% of the frizzies and all my hair is smooth.I 100% recommend getting the ""leave-in conditionor."" It is the best!I use to use a flat iron to control my friz and make my hair smooth, but now to not damage my hair, I use the ""leave-in conditioner"" one and it works just as well as a flat iron. First of all, this stuff smells great. It's light and feminine and reminds me of Bath and Body Works ""Sweet Pea"" scent. It makes your hair feel softer, smoother, and not sticky. I noticed it helps reduce frizz but won't do it on it's own. I have really frizzy hair so I use got2b in combination with another product specifically for frizz. I've bought leave-in conditioner several times (different places) and my only complaint is with the bottle pump. Twice I've had problems with the pump popping up before 1st use. Other than I really like this product. I was hesitant to buy this because other people were saying it came defective or open all over the place but the lady who cuts my hair used it and told me it was discontinued so I finally decided to buy it and I'M GLAD I DID! It doesn't make my hair oily it makes it feel soft, I like it much better than the bed head products I had tried before. A+ This is really great i use this along with a deep conditioner i take some deep conditioner leave it in for about 3, 4 hours then after i wash out with my smooth tresseme shampoo and conditioner , then when i get done with that i dry my hair til its just damp and add about 3 squirts of this and spread it through out my tips then then if my hairs a lil greasy the next day still i wash it one more and it comes out softer and thicker and all my curls have came back after ive bleached it and my curls jus look horrible i started with these products to fix it (im white/native american but i have really curly kinky hair so its a handfull) I love this stuff. I don't do a lot of stuff for my self, but this was the perfect treat for my hair and self confidence. I was thinking it was going go be a small bottle for the price but I was wrong, its a large and tall bottle. The smell is amazing, it smells like a candy shop. My husband (when hugging me) commented on my hair smelling good, and just for that I will forever buy this stuff. Its a lot like palmaide, but better. It smoothes out my mommy fly-aways and regular fly-aways. It makes my hair shinny and shimmery. Its smooth and lightweight, best of all it doesn't over do it in my hair like other products do. My hair never feels greasy, but does feel soft. It comes with cute charms attached to it, you can use them on a charm bracelet or necklace, or like me a keychain.",2,5,-3

I use them both...whichever one is closest when I reach for it.  I think maybe because it looks different from picks I've seen in stores that they are calling it professional.  I actually bought it because of the way it looks and was curious as to what makes this pick different from the one I was already using. would have given 5 stars if it's description really had anything to do with what this pick actually does different from my old pick. overall it feels when I use it to scratch my scalp. My daughter and I have super curly hair. Our stylist recommended this pick after she used it on us at our last appointment. Honestly, I had never thought of buying and using a pick but I'm so glad we purchased this! It goes through our hair so well, getting out tangles without much fuss or pain. I even use this on my youngest's hair (who is not a curly girl) and it has made detangling a breeze. No more tears! For us curly ladies in the family, this pick has allowed us to get through the tangles without the frizz. The best! I have long hair that is very tangly when it’s wet. This pick works great for getting hair smooth and free of tangles I love this comb. I only have one and I'm back for 2 more. I bought it a few years ago when the price was much higher. It was worth every penny. I originally bought this comb for myself but started using it in my girls' hair.  It's the only comb that we like to use. We use it for detangling, styling, parting, 'pinning' ...you name it! After a few years of very heavy use from all of us, one tooth finally gave in and broke but it lasted longer on our curly thick hair than any metal pick ever did. The tooth of the metal picks would seperate from the plastic and come right out! Lol! Not to mention, it would pull out much more hair. My hair has grown longer and healthier while using it due to less breakage. This is the best for kinky, curly hair (long or short). My brothers loves this he actually uses it every single day and it now gives him the hair he really needs. I actually use it on my own hair and i LOVVEEEE IT. Sometimes i just wanna change my hairstyle and ladies this does the job as well.It can give you that puffy pony tail that you adore along with helping your afro or your beautiful curls expand. We definitely don't regret buying this product but the only down side is the product is different from the picture. In the picture it look the product is made with metal but it actually made with plastic but it doesn't take away from the amazing benefits it can do for your hair. Usually, I don't take the time to leave a review but I feel that if a product meets my expectation(s) then it's good to let people know. This comb will not be for everyone but what product is? Last week I lost one of my favorite pick combs and out of desperation, I ordered this pick comb. I have an afro and if I have the wrong pick comb, picking it out can be torturous. I have a decent grade of hair but it gets tangled easily. This comb helped with the tangles without pulling out my hair. I plan to order a couple more of these in case I lose one. Money well spent for me! I have fine hair that gets so many tangles, and this is the best to get the tangles out! Long-lasting and sturdy! The comb is durable, friction free and I love how it stands on its own.  I leave it out on my counter for easier access. It works so well I purchased a second for traveling.",5,4,1

I used triple treat exclusively for about two months, despite the fact that my hair was itself starting to dry out. Finally my hair got to the the point that it was just too dry and I'd read various places that this smooth as silk is super moisturizing and decided to try it. It's really nice that they have the 2 oz bottles online b/c I didn't want to buy the giant ones in the store b/c I was worried it'd be to heavy for my (fine wavy to curly) hair but its not. The first use helped some but each use since has helped more. I use both the smooth as silk shampoo and conditioner. I also still use t3 products when I want a more clarifying wash.  The more I use the smooth as silk, the more healthy that my hair looks and feels over time. So far I love all of the Giovanni products I've tried! I would imagine 50/50 is great too, but I haven't tried it yet (sounds like more of a product for daily hair washers and I'm usually not one,I have the kind of hair texture that breaks too much when washed daily). It's a bit watery but that doesn't affect how it works. The majority of my hair is 4a and low porosity I believe making it hard to please however this works great with moisturizing and helping with de-tangling with added softness to touch. I haven't finished this yet or used it in months but will use it soon, if it works how I remember I will definitely be buying the full size. Just give it a try what do you have to lose it's only $2? This is my current leave in conditioner. I love the Giovanni line in general. This leave-in is light weight and doesn't leave a reside in my hair. It makes my hair soft and the protein prevents breakage. I also appreciate that it is very natural and does not contain silicone's. When I first tried this product, I had extremely chemically damaged hair and this product did not absorb well into my hair. Once my hair grew out again and was more healthy, I tried this product again and it works wonderfully. Giovanni Smooth as Silk Conditioner is as good as the shampoo by the same name. I ordered the 2 ounce size of this one, too, and this is eligible for Prime shipping, unlike the shampoo.  It leaves hair soft and with no tangles, but not limp.  I have color on my hair, and some hair products strip the color, but this doesn't.  The ingredients listed are almost all natural and as with the shampoo, there are no animal by-products in it and it is cruelty-free, which is important to me.I most definitely recommend this for anyone who wants soft, shiny hair. This product was all over the internet about this GiOVANNI CONDITIONER as a Natural it had my hair feel dry really dry. I was not happy i brought 3 what a waste of money. I will not get this product again don't recommend it at all for anyone. Love this product. Just needed something smaller for traveling I was so excited to try this conditioner after seeing the great reviews. On opening the container I almost spilled it because I did not expect it to be to watery. After washing, I did not feel like my hair felt conditioned at all. I did not notice any improvement in moisture in my hair again. I will not be giving this product another shot. If you want your hair to be dry like hay, use this. Otherwise... stay away.",5,2,3

This conditioner feels wonderful on the scalp and is great for scalp massages. It has a minty smell and tingling sensation. The conditioner has little dissolving beads to assist with scalp exfolliation. Leaves hair soft. I use in conjunction with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree hair thinning system (shampoo, conditioner and serum). Immediate relief from an itchy, angry scalp. The exfoliating beads are still in my hair after thoroughly rinsing. Also, the instructions on the bottle are confusing and don’t tell you in what order you should put it on — before or after shampoo/conditioner? — and just tell you to put on a “small amount.” In comparison to what? More or less than the amount of shampoo I’d use? I also didn’t feel any tingling. BUT — my scalp isn’t itchy today, so that’s a plus. Love this thing it has turned my scalp health around completely I've used this and other Paul Mitchell products for many years. I easily got used to the strong tea-tree scent (then again, I regularly use EOs).I like the product because it leaves my scalp fresh and tingly and my hair soft yet strong. It also helps keep seborrheic dermatitis at bay and reduces itching.During the COVID pandemic, after losing my job and being forced into early retirement, one expense I cut was getting my hair colored, and I think this product helped restore enough of my real color that I'm now a natural (albeit silvery) blonde at 60+. (This happy accident may partly be due to stress reduction and/or weird genetics...who knows? Is coloring a vicious toxic cycle? Was I wasting my money on it all those years?)After shampooing and squeezing excess water out of my hair, I apply a few drops of my own Young Living EO mixture (tea tree, lavender, and lemongrass) and after about a minute, add this hair/scalp treatment. I let both soak in for a few minutes and then massage my head with a firm scalp brush and work everything through to the ends. The tingly-fresh sensation is great--an oxymoronic spicy-cool feeling of clean and detox'd. After another couple of minutes, I rinse thoroughly, squeeze out excess water, and finish with Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage thickening conditioner. I'm not sure if this is the best order, but it works well for me.One caveat: While the pump is a far better deal than the small size and I like the convenience of a pump dispenser, I found that, unfortunately, the micro-beads in the product tend to get stuck in a big clump around the pump's spring mechanism. Therefore, I now keep the pump container in the bathroom closet and transfer the product periodically (without using the pump, of course) to a squeeze bottle with a removable top (which happens to be an old Mountain Ocean Skin Trip bottle) for use in the shower. This product works great and smells great. Worth every penny! I was born with extremely thick cradle cap and discovered later that I would get large welts (largest was a bit bigger than a half dollar) on my scalp that would itch. When scratched off, a clear oily liquid would ooze from the opening down my neck, soaking my hair. My mother would always have me wash my hair, scratch everything open, and pour rubbing alcohol on my scalp -- which stung but it made it go away for months before I would have a relapse. For a long time I thought it was simply a stronger form of dandruff, unsuccessfully treating it with Head & Shoulders (which left my hair greasy, frizzy, and feeling like straw) or coconut oil soaks (which softened my hair but didn't reduce dandruff). It wasn't until later that I discovered the real name for this (seborrheic dermatitis) and that I have it genetically from my mother, whom treated it for years with Listerine or rubbing alcohol (as she had me do for years). However the alcohol trick stopped working when I entered my 20's and I would have to suffer through this until it cleared or scabbed over from being scratched too much. The last ""break out"" was too much -- all over the scalp, tiny bumps leaking and itching -- so I started looking into products that would help. As I also once suffered from acne and have dermatitis in my ears, I've long ago discovered the joys of salicylic acid (good for treatment of almost any form of dermatitis) in a world where I am allergic to even the smallest amounts of benzoyl peroxide.I ordered this last week, received it Friday, and began immediately. I have only been using Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Hair and Scalp Treatment for 3 days and there is already a marked difference in my scalp. All the healing or developing patches have disappeared, leaving my scalp smooth and soft under my hair. It's also cut back on the dandruff I lived with for a long time as well. The first two days I used it as a shampoo rather than conditioner and, while it did leave my hair a little oily, it left my hair soft and reduced my scalp itchiness. On the third day I washed my hair with my typical cheap shampoo, then used the Scalp Treatment as conditioner, wrapped it up in my turbie twist towel and left it in for 5-10 minutes. My scalp got cold and tingly (just like it's supposed to), then I rinsed thoroughly and dried my hair completely. No oily look, completely manageable, softer than a kitten. Today I only shampooed and left out the Scalp Treatment -- my scalp and hair still feel soft and smell vaguely of peppermint, only minor itchy spots left to treat tomorrow. I'm hoping to use this a couple times a week to keep the dermatitis at bay. Thanks, Paul Mitchell!Please note that the product does look and smell a lot like toothpaste. If you don't like the smell of peppermint, this product is not for you. Be sure to massage it into wet hair/scalp and, for best results, leave in for the full 5 minutes (I recommend wrapping your head in a towel). I needed this! Like the product.",4,2,2

Oz (Pack of 1)","There haven't been any lice outbreaks in our kids schools so beyond the seller's reported proof, we really cannot tell if Rosemary Repel products protect from the horrible little monsters. That said, the entire family loves the smell of this conditioner. We use it in conjunction with the shampoo, kids hare is softer and easier to comb with it. What would be totally awesome is if we could get this formula in a concentrated form as we are trying desperately to trim down our use of single use plastics. One option could be a bar or cake packaged in biodegradable/compostable paper, that could be added to water in a glass sprayer. 1 - the rosemary scent is STRONG with this!!! If you don't like Rosemary that can be a negative... we do, so we like it!! I can't tell you how effective it is against lice - we have been using it and my daughter hasn't gotten lice despite being near someone who is infested... is that the spray? Luck? etc... Can't say for sure2 - This stuff makes her hair AMAZING!! Very soft and really helps to detangle!! We will continue to use this regularly even after lice is fully eradicated just for the detangling aspect.STRONGLY RECOMMEND!! I work at a place where kids come and go all day and we have field trips come. Recently, a kiddo visited with active lice and suddenly my childhood fear was rekindled. I have long, fairly thick hair that those little buggies would really like, so I went looking for something that would put my mind at ease and found this. Now, I can't rate it on it's effectiveness of keeping lice away as I'm not willing to go rub my hair in strange places, but I can tell you that this spray is so incredibly moisturizing. It is lightweight on the hair and my hair stayed so incredibly soft all day. The smell is a little strong, but not in a bad way, especially because it'll repel lice. This product definitely has helped me relax at work whenever a kiddo scratches at their head, and my hair feeling so great after using it is a definite plus! We have been using this daily on our four elementary aged kids for about 2 years now and I’m pleased to report our lice encounters have drastically improved! As an added bonus it smells great and is an above average detangler on my girlies’ long locksDefinitely recommend for families with young kids I can’t express it enough this is an amazing product. I use it on my daughter daily. Kids in her classroom have been getting lies and my daughter has been clean. The smell is okay if you are used to essential oils and things like that. It smells herbal obliviously. I find that it doesn't condition my youngest daughter's hair, who has coily hair and makes it harder to brush. My oldest has fine wavyish hair, and it's okay. I usually detangle their hair with a different leave-in conditioner than spray this last. My sole purpose is to prevent lice with this product; so far, so good, even with a break out at my daughters' school. As a kindergarten teacher and a mom of two (5 & 12), I have A LOT of exposure to childrens’ heads. I swear by the Fairytales line and completely contribute the fact that no one in my family has gotten lice to it’s effectiveness! Other teachers in school come to my room for my “magic spray” if lice is going around, and I haven’t known a teacher to get it yet! Also, everyone comments on how great it smells! I really like the way fairy tales smells and it doesn’t leave a residue in your hair",3,5,-2

I was hunting for a nice lash primer. This one was a bit thin so it doesn’t do much for thickness but it is good if you was thicker but more natural lashes. I end up always going toward Clinique primer. Also Laura messier not sure I spelled that correctly I like hers also because it’s already black. So it’s easier to cover. But the Clinique brand is easy to cover and gives you plenty of thickness. I bought this product in December of 2019.  I have long, jumbled up eyelashes.  An issue I have is that my eyelids get irritated, stingy and painful out of nowhere and my instinctive solution is to pull at my lashes for instant relief, to the point of bald eyelid patches.  I have had this problem for years.  I ordered this out of desperation.  I didn't get this for eyelash growth or anything else except for conditioning and honestly think my issue occurs less often.  I only use it on days when I wear mascara, about 3 to 4 times a week, and even rarely before bed.  I have only had crusty eyes a few times after waking up if I used at bedtime.  Otherwise, I don't have any eye irritation, although I would recommend anyone to be cautious the first few times when using a product so close to the eyes.  I have never had a primer to compare it with, but it is practically my primer.  Excess can leave white tips, but this can be brushed over by mascara or a dry brush.  Since my lashes jumble and patch up in sections, it helps to use this to adjust them and spread them out, though my lashes are still pretty much 'set in their ways.'  I like using it on my brows before or after brow makeup as a hold.  If the white color still appears, I just use a brow brush to sweep the excess off.  I will likely purchase this again. This will be my second time using this product and I love it and it works. I can’t imagine using mascara without the eyelash conditioner. There’s a huge difference when I use mascara alone and when I use this lash conditioner with mascara. Initially had issues with receiving this product but customer service was helpful and sent a replacement. I wear this primer just as a mascara. I have very light brown eyelashes. It goes on white but dries clear. It darkens just a bit when dry. It stays soft and not crunchy. Love it.  (wife of Nicholas Petti) Does it make your lashes longer and fuller - definitely not. Does it protect from mascara? I have no way to tell. Not very much product in the tube, I know that much. Product comes unsealed which is a nice touch. This is great even under your regular primer..it adds so much of everything I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have naturally long eyelashes, but they tend to grow in all kinds of directions and get tangled with each other every time I blink... It's infuriating. So I tried changing my mascara and even plucking, but it just seemed to make it worse. I've tried other products with a similar promise, but have had no success. After using this product the first time, I could see a significant difference in the quality of my lashes and how they laid. After just a few days the problem was 100% corrected, just a distant memory. AND I even noticed that my eyelashes were getting even longer and healthier the more I used it. Before I told my husband I was using a conditioner for my eyelashes, he noticed how great they looked and likened them to a Disney princess' eyelashes or the eyelashes that they put on the character hats at Disney (weird reference, but if you'll understand if you've ever seen them).I apply the conditioner right before I apply my mascara every morning. The conditioner not only conditions the lashes, but it also acts like a primer for your mascara, helping your eyelashes appear thicker, and your mascara apply smoother. It's also helped my tougher mascaras wash off easier too. I tried applying it at night before bed, but the conditioner ended up drying similarly to mascara and becoming chunky and difficult to put mascara on over it the next morning. Since it does apply with a whitish tint, I wouldn't wear it alone or as a natural mascara gel, unless you happens to like white eyelashes then by all means go for it.If you're looking for an eyelash boost similar to Revitalash without paying an arm and a leg - THIS IS YOUR PRODUCT! I couldn't endorse it more without them paying me lol.",2,4,-2

It's supposed to make your hair grow faster? I believe the 'growth' that this oil promotes stems from the oil itself keeping your hair moisturized. Dry hair can lead to easier breakage and in turn, hair loss. Moisturized hair is happy hair. Ideally, you could do this with any oil.The smell is quite strong and could take some getting used to for those with sensory sensitivities. You could use this anytime within your beauty regimen. I usually added this to my scalp at night, massaged my hair for a few minutes, twisted my hair and placed it inside a bonnet, and went to bed. I have seen others who have used this oil as a hot oil treatment or used this oil alongside other creams and lotions that promote hair growth.Growth comes along with consistency. Try it! You could probably find a cheaper price at your local beauty supply. I Can see the difference in my hair I love this I was first very skeptical about the product when a friend of mine introduce it to me. I was really SURPRISE the package didn't had any strange chemical smell or anything. You can use it for different of ages and hair textures. For example, I noticed my son had a bald spot on front of his hair.. so I applied a very SMALL amount like you would do for hair gel after a hot shower, then  rub it throughout the scalp.  I can tell a difference in his hair now because there is actually growth in his hair. This product is great for repairing damaged or missing baby hairs around the edges of hairline.I'm on my second jar and it does work. It does have a slight med smell so I recommend using it at bedtime. You will not notice a difference right away, but in a few months hair will begin to show where you placed the grease. Note: IT DID NOT THICKEN my hair but generated regrowth of fine hairs in the areas of usage. For this reason, I gave only 4 stars.Follow the directions and happy growing. Will buy again Really love using this product, even with my fine hair. Works wonders. No dislike I have been using doo growth products every since high school and I will never stop being a customer of doo growth products. Their products work extremely well with my hair.

I started using Hesh Brahmi Amla Herbal hair oil mixed with the Hesh Shikakai Herbal Hair for about two weeks now. About every few nights I mix the two oils together and massage my scalp with my figer tips (not my nails) and then I put on a silk bonnet.So far I have mixed feelings about this product. I first purchased this product because of all the high reviews it recieved. One of the things I like about this product is the way my hair feels in the morning when I wake up. I find using this oil,and massaging it into my scalp helps my hair to be more managable when I wake up. And I don't have to put to much work in styling it. And it also helps stop breakage So that's a major plus. As of right now it is way to soon to tell if this oil does all the things its promised to do like grow hair which is the main reason I ordered it. Since healthy hair grows 1/2 per month I expect six months to pass before I see major results.I'm also doing other things to help in hair growth like taken Biotin/ Nioxin hair supplements and getting my dead ends trimed, as of right now my hair is shoulder length. The Brahmi Oil can be a bit messy and it tends to drip down your neck and eye if you apply too much in your hair the smell is also a little over powering. I'm in college and I live with few other girls and none of them are a fan of Brahmi. But Beauty is pain, so I will keep using the oil for six months before I write another review. And doing any type of oil treatment is time consuming so if you don't have much time on your hands I would not recommand oil treatments. So I bought this oil for my hair for all the reasons others have stated.  Hair growth, strength, density etc. The first night I got it I went ahead and slept with it on my hair.  It does smell very bad but with a shower cap it wasn't too bad.  The worst part was the shower cap itself but oh well.  I did then mix a little the next day into my powders.  Again with a shower cap the smell wasn't horrible and left the paste on for about an hour.  I shampoo/conditioned my hair and made sure everything was out.  I did dry my hair as well and the smell seemed to be completely gone.  HOWEVER you cannot get rid of the smell completely.  A few days later I went to get my hair cut and as soon as it was wet the smell was back.  Also I am a person who works out and sweats a lot.  I was so embarrassed by the smell that I had to leave spin class early and have completely removed this oil from my routine.  I do still use amla powder but it does not leave such a potent lingering smell as this amla oil does.  I have switched to the vatika oil instead and although it doesn't smell great from the bottle there are no after effects and I can now go back to doing my regular spinning and body pump classes.  I guess this oil is ok if you don't sweat, plan on getting you hair wet in the vicinity of people or don't mind walking around smelling like rancid, old, stale perfume.  But I would suggest looking at the vatika oil instead and love love love all of my powders that I am using on my hair and face.  But this product was not worth the money, as stated go try the vatika oil instead. i started out using this product, a bit too enthusiastically..it is not greasy, thus, i felt, my hair/scalp wasn't well moisturized..it has a light scent - almost like chammomile, and can be worn in hospital environments..if you use too much, you will notice an ""oil halo"" around the neck and shoulders of your clothes..if you're wearing white, it will be a light green color..I was walking around the gym, and wondered why i was getting these strange looks...and was laughed at while i was work..no one told me about this ""halo"" until i took off my lab coat at the end of the day to see this light green seepage..or this dark seepage on my favorite workout sweat shirt...otherwise, i use this, and the shikaki oil, intermittently, and they are definitely staples in my hair regimen..if used sparingly.. i live in a very dry place and your hair can take on hell of a beating here. Ive used this stuff for 1 year and my hair has grown so much 5 inchs total. I will admit the smell is something to get use to and you only need a LITTLE bit my hair looks thicker and my hairdresser loves that i use this and has recommended this to other people who have damged dry hair. i will advise this will make your hair grow like crazy and if you cant deal with the new growth then i suggest you use this product only once a week instead of every other day as i did. This product es amazing Pero the smell is horrible Pero it’s amazing for my hair !!! Will continue to use wit essential oils SO I bought this Brahmi Alma Oil for my hair.  My hair has dry ends and I thought this was going to help out as the explanation on the back side of the bottle claims it should.  What happened is entirely opposite.  I felt as though I was actually rubbing baby oil onto my scalp.  It smells and feels just like baby oil  =]  However, it was so bad on my hairs.  The next morning in my shower I noticed little peices of my hair everywhere on the shower walls and on my shampoo bottles, every where.I couldn't believe it.  What seemed to be so easy to use and gentle was DEFINATELY NOT.  It would be fine if it didn't break off my hairs, and if this oil had a more natural list of ingredients. I am sadden that I purchased this product from Amazon.com, when I found this product at my local grocer for cheaper. The oil has a woodsy smell but its bareable, I have noticed a difference in my hair, no more shedding and it is much stronger. This oil did wonders for my hair. My hair became dry and brittle from using an informercial product,and after reading the reviews for this oil I decided to try it.  Within one week my hair was so soft and shiny that I will never want to be with out this oil again.  Afican-American hair can be very hard to maintain especially in the winter combined with damage from a gel like product,so I would recommend this oil to anyone experiencing dry .brittle, and damaged hair.",2,5,-3

I’ve been dying my hair N3 with one and only argon oil dye for…for probably a decade. I’m tired of the upkeep so I planned to go a bit lighter.I’ve been dying for so long I typically don’t expect much from stripping products but It did pull color from old highlights and it lifted maybe 1 or 2 levels after three applications. It didn’t leave my hair terribly damaged but it did feel stripped/thin. Nothing a conditioning mask couldn’t fix.The smell - I’ve smelled more terrible things in my life but this wasn’t great and it lingers. It’s a very specific sulfur egg fart smell. My roommates came home and asked if our septic pipes had broken. I think that’s a bit over dramatic but it did fill my very large house. If you’ve ever spent time in a hair salon you can likely handle the smell. It also stuck around in my hair for at least three or four showers. Don’t do this if you work in a small office or close quarters. So my hair was actually stained very dark in the middle and lighter on the damaged ends. I was in brighter light in photo 1 than 2.  I was coloring it dark brown for a long time then i put a burgundy over it but it was basically stained dark in the middle and it just looked bad and unprofessional.  This removed the burgundy and the dark brown stain and left it kind of coppery. Now I’ll apply all over color.The smell is strong but it washes out no problem. It did leave my hair a little dry but not as dry as I expected. It’s a winner for me. I didn’t mix it all up and I have enough left for another round of this game if need to do it again since I don’t have a ton of hair on my head.I’ve stripped my hair out in my youth using a hair bleaching concoction and that left my hair much more straw like than this product. So, long story short, I went to the salon last weekend to get my natural blonde brightened up. I can’t afford to get my highlights done often, so this is an indulgence for me. Wellllllll, just a few nights I was washing my hair when I used what I thought was a purple toning conditioner to neutralize brassy tones in blonde hair. It turned out the be my fiancé’s purple hair dye. I washed a lot of it out over several washes, but it wasnt budging from the lightest parts of my hair. The first two photos were taken in the same lighting on the same day. I first washed and blow dried my hair as normal, then applied the product very thoroughly using a fine toothed comb. I rinsed thoroughly and shampooed twice, but there was still some lingering darkness so I repeated the process again. I waited until after using the processor before I used a high quality hair mask to return some moisture. I definitely think my hair is still slightly darker than it was before ~the incident~ but it also looks much better than it did this morning. I’m happy enough with it until I can afford to get it done by a professional again. I'm floored that this worked as well as it did! There was black, brown, red, purple, blue.... Just so much to work with and it came out really even all over. It's not quite as orange as my photo appears, my phone saturates everything. It's more of a golden color which is a perfect foundation to bleach and tone.My only issues are that it dries out your hair. Make sure to add a good mask or repair treatmentIt stinks. You will stink. It smells like rotten eggs and I'm 2 weeks post color removal and it STILL smells like rotten eggs when wet. I have washed it daily, multiple times, shampoo and conditioner, I've used leave in conditioner and nothing gets rid of that strench. It's getting less potent but it's still gross and embarrassing. Si tú crees que esto te sacará el color en una sola pasada estás equivocada, reduce el tono definitivamente pero en mi caso tuve que hacer varias veces el proceso para poder llegar a eliminar el 50% del color aprox. Esto es más amigable con tu cabello que una decoloración pero te deja el cabello oliendo horrible. 🥲😅 I dyed my hair black (box) over a dark brown (box) dye; my natural color is a dark brown with white streaks. Both the box dye colors were removed and now my hair is actually the most perfect orangish red color. I want it to be this color always. My only question is can I use this on my roots? Haha. On the serious note I’ll have to wait to see how my hair grows out as I may have to dye it again or something, ugh. Perhaps/Hopefully my hair has been turning red, and I did strip it down to the natural color as hoped. Hair naturally turning red does happen when dark brown hair starts turning white. Side note, after covering my head with a hotel issued shower cap, I also wrapped aluminum foil around my head per the recommendation of using heat to help remove the color faster (I’ve seen this done in salons) and left it on the recommended 20 minutes.Downside… the color is not even throughout. I can see a line in which the color is darker.I don’t know why others complain about the smell. What do y’all expect to happen when you put chemicals in your hair? And what kind of shampoo do you use that won’t get rid of the chemical smell? I didn’t have that issue at all.Complaints: Bottle two was leaking upon arrival. Bottle three says ‘processing lotion’, but there was nothing creamy lotiony about it. It’s like water.Last side note. Ethnicity can effect the results of hair dyes/bleaches/coloring. I’m biracial Mexican and Irish *see before and after hair photo Its hard to find a good color striper without paying a lot at a salon. This product will save you money and works well. Dyed my hair with semi-permanent color.  I didn't love it so used this product to remove the color.  It definitely took out the majority of the color except a bit of a red tone.  However, I think that had more to do with the hair color and not this product.  It did STINK despite me having washed my hair thoroughly.  Like rotten eggs - but I don't think any other product would smell any better than this and work effectively.",1,4,-3

If you have fine, oily hair that doesn't tangle easily this is a great conditioner to try. I have normal hair and sensitive skin - I don't have limp or thin hair that needs thickening. I was looking for products that are organic and contain little or no chemicals. Avalon Organic fits the bill and I use both the shampoo and conditioner. So far so good and the product smells good, too. My hair feels great and it's good to know that I'm not dumping a bunch of chemicals on my head every morning.I tried an organic Lavender shampoo+conditioner and that dried out my hair and scalp. In the past I have also used Matrix for Men, Redken for Men and American Crew. They just never did it for me. I bought this because I wanted to use a shampoo/conditioner set that wasn't full of chemicals.  After reading a few reviews here I opted to buy it.  So far my hair feels the same as with the previous organic shampoo.  My hair is fine and I'm looking for more body.  I'll keep using it since I bought it but I was hoping for more ""oomph"" if you know what I mean. Packaging says 70 percent organic ingredients . . .I approve. Arrived promptly, and the three bottles were a decent size. I feel like I got good value for my dollar . . .well, their dollar now. I was mainly looking for a ph balanced shampoo and conditioner, which was cruelty free. It doesn't work as dramatically well as commercial products, but natural hair products never do, since they are not loaded with chemicals. However it does detangle, and to save money I just use it on the ends, as those tend to be the parts needing conditioned the most. My dad and I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for years. His hair has always been very thin. He has a full head of hair now. He's 67 years old and his hair has never been thicker! I love that it's not harmful forthe Earth, and it leaves your hair light, soft, and fluffy. It lasts forever, too. I also use the conditioner to remove my mascara. Absolutely nothing works better, and it doesn't sting the eyes in any way. You need to wet the lashes first and rinse with water, of course! I really like both the shampoo and the conditioner.  They smell really nice and seem to be a great product.  My only complaint on the conditioner is that the bottle doesn't let the conditioner come out easily.  It might be better in different packaging. The reason for giving it only 3 stars is the difficulty of getting the conditioner out of the bottle. I've use this product for quite sometime now and I saw that amazon had this product avaiable so I purchase it.  The only problem I have is that the bottles came opened (the cap popped open). So it leaked  even though it was in a plastic bag it was messy and of course also the loss of the product that spilled out was annoying. This product was awful, but might be good for your horse's hair! I have been out looking for a grate organic shampoo & conditioner set for weak fine hair, so when I saw this product get such high reviews I was convinced that this was it! NOT!! The shampoo smells kinda funky, it is super runny but does foam a little. It feel like the shampoo does it's job by stripping all the dirt and oils (good & bad) from the hair leaving it super gangly and unmanageably. This shampoo seems more like a clarify product one would use occasionally. The conditioner does not do a better job making up for the dry, stringy, hair left after shampooing. It is pretty thick in texture and smells okay, it doesn't weight down your hair. After hair dries, it does look oily, but then again there is really no moisture there at all. I feel that this particular set sucks, I would never buy this product again.",2,4,-2

It was the best one EVER. It was the best product YOU ever made, too! At least for curly girls. Even on sweltering days, even with all the oppressing humidity, even when it rained!I've tried so many products for my curly hair. One that helps it air dry naturally, keeps my curls soft, free of frizz, and full of body and well-defined spirals. Oh, and one that works during all weather conditions and doesn't dry out my hair to boot.All those other products I buy I end up wanting to throw out nigh the same day, crying over my wasted money and lack of acceptable results. There is NOTHING to replace this product. Mousse makes curls crunchy -- have never found one that doesn't...yuck. Cremes all seem to not be strong enough to counteract the frizz or provide enough definition. Oils weigh the curls down. This ethereal gel is the best thing my curls have ever touched. I would beg Nexxus to bring it back, and I'm seriously considering paying the exorbitant prices for all remaining bottles of product here on Amazon, because it's that GOOD. Seriously.Maybe it's time to just straighten my locks. I don't want to. I like my curly hair, I really do...but I can't stand the thought of the way my curls will look without this perfect product, and I can't find anything else anywhere that works so well :'(If I ever have the luck of finding a product that is a suitable replacement, I will definitely be reviewing it, so other curly girls might benefit, so long as Amazon offers it. This product is great. I have thick, naturally curly hair that I usually blow dry straight. When it's humid and I don't feel like spending time with the blow drier I let it air dry but, first I add the magic ingredients-Nexxus alluring curls mixed with Aveda Stay Curly. If you over use alluring curls they get crunchy so, take it easy. Can't find this product in the drug stores any more so Amazon is perfect. I read the reviews and thought i would try it out. I have wavy hair but I'm tried of always having to blow dry & hot iron. Received it yesterday and WOW! it really does work, i had the beach look i wanted. I used the diffuser  as recommended and hair was still a little wet (didn't fully dry) when i got to work. I received compliments and I was glad it doesn't give you that wet look that other products do. Hair war still touchable and bouncy and held up after being at a windy baseball game later that day. Will purchase again. This stuff is fantastic. If you have curly hair, either natural or permed, you will love it. Keeps the frizz away and gives you days of gorgeous curls. It does make your hair a little crunchy but if you run your fingers through your hair when it is dry it eliminates the crunch and keeps the curls. Outstanding product. I tried this gel several times; I have wavy, fine, medium-thick hair. It just made my hair have pointy, stiff spikes at the ends. It didn't enhance the curl at all. Otherwise, the texture was good if you're looking for a stiff, sticky gel, so I gave it two stars. I love Nexxus products and was hoping I had found a product for naturally wavy hair.This isn't the one. It is just a typical gel. It made my hair stiff and heavy. I use this gel everyday to help control the frizz in my naturally curly hair.  It's lightweight so it doesn't weigh my hair down, but it does a nice job of controlling the friz.  Good curl definition. I use it every day on my towel-dried hair. This product didn't seem to help my already wavy hair with curls.  It felt very sticky and seemed to weigh my hair down.",3,5,-2

The longest layers go down until my rear. I've never paid a lot of attention to my hair-dryers, always using those I was given (I can't give you exact models. I know one of them was a Wella and another was a Braun). In the past years (I'm in my mid-20s now) I have realized that my once naturally shiny and healthy hair was beginning to get lots of split ends. I wasn't sure if it was because of my hectic lifestyle (and malnourishment), the bleaching and dying of my hair or other reasons. I don't use hot styling appliances often. I never use straighteners, because I have very straight hair and I rarely have the time to curl my hair. So the main 'hot' product I've used was my blow-dryer. But the last 3 years I have paid more attention to the products I use on my hair (mainly TIGI Bed Head) and my hair's been growing healthy again.Last year, after moving once more (fom a 220V country to the USA) I never actually bought a new hair-dryer and was just using my tiny travel dryer (where you can switch the Volts) for around 8 months. I noticed how much worse my hair was getting. It was frizzy, it broke easily, it split deeply (not just at the end) and of course it took forever and a half to dry my hair with that tiny travel dryer. Whilst it had been cheap and perfect for travelling, I realized it's not the greatest choice to use regularly.Hence, I decided to actually invest some time into buying a new hair dryer. After researching it seemed that there is not such a big difference between middle-priced dryers and expensive dryers but a big quality difference between cheap dryers and middle-priced dryers. And since I would just be using this dryer at home, it doesn't need to perform at saloon conditions (my hair stylists all said they would not trust BaByliss at their saloons, because they wouldn't be able to 'take the heat' ;) ). That's why I went for this BaByliss in the medium price range (I have the BaByliss Big Hair Brush and a Waver and had great experiences with them). I was also interested in the Tourmaline that's supposed to emit even more negative ions.~~~THE PROS~~~- It's WARM, but not too hot, meaning that the risk of heat damage is decreased (I use the hottest setting for most of the process, the Cold hot shot button for the end to allow my hair to cool and my styling to settle). More importantly:- It's FAST-DRYING. I have seen that some reviewers complained about this dryer not being 'hot enough' but I think it is warm enough. Besides, it's not about how hot it is, but how evenly it distributes the air and how evenly it heats in general. And this really dries my hair well. It used to take 20-30 minutes to dry my hair, with the BaByliss Pro I am done in 8-12 minutes! Although I stop in between to put styling products into my hair. (And as mentioned above, my hair goes down to my hip, so 8-12 minutes is amazing!)- It has a strong, steady air flow. I use the black nozzle that comes with it (and I've never had the problem of it falling off like other reviewers have said) and it just directs a steady air flow so evenly at exactly where I want it to blow. The air pressure is just perfect.- It's LIGHT. Although I don't actually have to hold it for all that long, I do appreciate it if my appliances don't weigh too much.~~~THE CONS~~~- The BUTTONS. Other reviewers have already said it. The buttons on the handle were a tragic design choice. I feel myself not really gripping the handle of it, because I'm always afraid I will accidentally push another button. I have accidentally switched it off a few times or changed the heater settings from hot to warm or cold. This can be a bit annoying, especially since I often switch hands because I use a round bristle brush to pre-style my hair while blow-drying.- The CABLE/ADAPTER. I don't know if it's the cable or the adapter or some circuit error, but I know some reviewers have stated that their BaByliss stopped working after a short period of time. I have had some troubles switching it on myself. Since even my cheap, tiny travel hair dryer has had no problems with the electrical sockets it must be this hair dryer. I ALWAYS perform the suggested 'Reset' and 'Test'-routine that you should do before usage and it always tests positively. Still, sometimes my dryer just won't switch on. I just unplug it, try to straighten the cord, plug it back in, hit Rest and Test again. Sometimes I have to do this 2-3 times and so far, it hasn't stopped working entirely. (I've only had it since November 2013 however and now it's January 2014).~~~THE MENTIONABLE:~~~(Things that don't bother me, but you'd maybe like to know about).- The SIZE. While not being as chunky as some of my past hair dryers, it's also not that small, either. I am fine with it, since I don't plan to travel with this dryer (I just need every inch of my luggage so I always only pack my travel dryer that folds together).- The NOISE level. While I don't find it excessively loud, it's not exactly what I would call quiet either. But then again, I am a bit sensitive when it comes to noise and am quickly leaning towards the 'it's too loud'-party. So I am not bothered by the noise, but I didn't use it and immediately think 'Wow, this is exceptionally quiet', because it's fairly normal.~~~THE CONCLUSION~~~I love the results.It dries my hair quickly (which is VERY important to me), it doesn't seem to excessively damage my hair (of course you should know using any hair dryer is not the healthiest choice for your hair), meaning my hair looks shiny and healthy (no split ends!) and it provides me with exactly what I need for a price of 50 USDs, which I find reasonable.I acknowledge that there are a few flaws and some room for improvement, but I am just so happy with the job it does that I don't care that I sometimes accidentally switch it off or that I can't firmly grip it around the middle of the handle. Whether this is what you need or if the flaws are something you can compromise on is based on your personal preference. This is by far the best hair dryer I have ever purchased.  It was pricey, but if it lasts a long time it will be worth it. My hair stylist retired during the pandemic and I was unfairly forced to do my hair myself.  Lol.  Not really but I'm not very adventurous when it comes to hairstyles so I decided to save the money and just started washing, blow drying, and flat ironing my hair myself.  What. A. Chore!  I've had and used the basic comb-style Hot Tools dryer for years, only to replace it after I break the teeth.  White looking into better hair care products in general, I came across this BabyBliss hair dryer.  My friend recommended their brand of flat iron and I love it.  What an upgrade!  I used it just days after receiving it I noticed a significant difference in blow drying time and my hair was straighter. When my hair is wet, it draws up like cotton.  Let's just say if there is any Native American in my family, the hair part definitely skipped me.  I've been told my hair is fine and soft.  I am very happy with the results, I feel it made my flat ironing time easier, so I will highly recommend this hair dryer.  It does not come with a comb attachment so I purchased the Red by Kiss comb attachment Model # UBP1K01 also from Amazon and it attached swimmingly. Only hairdryer that you can set on high and warm rather than burn your hair on hot. I have to start with the fact that I have extremely baby fine hair, and to top it off, I don't have a lot of hair. I've lived my whole adult life trying to find ways to help my hair grow longer and give it some volume. Shoulder length seems to be its limit on looking healthy, and about 1"" past was always its absolute limit before the ""infestation"" of  split ends keeps it from growing any more or looking healthy. Last year I changed shampoo, conditioner, and styling product, which helped quite a bit for volume, but still needed help getting more length that didn't have to be cut due to breakage/split ends. Right before our state placed the Covid 19  stay at home order, I had read about getting the right hair dryer for your hair type for healthier hair. The top dryer on the list was $300... Um, no. I chose this one based on price/reviews. Annoyingly, I was supposed to get my hair trimmed the week the dryer came, but didn't get to go. It's now 2 full months after I received this dryer (still waiting to be able to get my hair cut) and I'm very pleased! Unfortunately, because my hair was in poor condition from my old dryer when I started using this one, all the hair growth I've had will have to be cut off when salons open again. Having my hair grow 1-2"" longer than it ever has in almost 30 yrs is so encouraging! The first week of using the dryer I started having better hair days again and wasn't as anxious to get into a salon. At this point I'm dying already, but very pleased with the dryer's results in the meantime. There are 2 heat settings like my old dryer, but I can actually use the lower heat send setting on this one which I've never been able to do before with good results. I use the high blower setting with my diffuser and I get great results! I was hesitant to buy this dryer after reading some reviews about the color rubbing off pretty early on. At least for right now, it still looks brand new. I'm happy enough with its results that if the color does eventually rub off at some point, I really don't care as long as it still works the same. I had a difficult time spending over $70 on a dryer, but it was well worth it. If I'm able to add an update to my review in the future, I'd love to post after I get my hair trimmed and my hair starts growing out. That'll be the best indicator of how it helps people with thin hair. Until then I can't imagine it's a bad dryer for other hair types but at least for VERY fine curly hair it's awesome!",5,3,2

It's not for color treated hair. I love the shampoo!  I have silver hair and I wash it twice a week. I know it’s a Sunday shampoo (jokingly), but I do use it on Sunday night and follow with moisture rich purple conditioner.  My hair stays clean and fresh for days and absolutely takes care of scalp issues and product buildup (I use a lot of hair oils) and it cleans without drying.  It’s authentic and a good price. I bought this shampoo to help remove silicone buildup in my curly hair so I could focus on curly girl methods, but realized this was also the perfect shampoo to help keep my hair and my kids hair fresh during our 4-5 days a week in a chlorinated pool for swim. We use this about once a week and use a regular shampoo on other days. It's got a nice fresh scent like most bumble products, not overpowering or sickly synthetic smelling. It has a really nice lather and rinses cleanly, and doesn't leave our hair dry and crispy like some do. I had high hopes for this shampoo. It works ok, but so does my regular $7 a bottle shampoo. I can't notice any huge difference since I started using it. I use product and hair spray. It obviously builds up. Sunday shampoo gets rid of all that gunk and still leaves your hair soft and manageable. On my 2nd bottle. Looking for a shampoo that I could use dailyIt’s perfect I have super greasy, thick hair. The kind of hair where no matter ho good I was my hair, there is still a random grease spot. No. Matter. What. So frustrating. This shampoo is so far the best for degreasing my hair. But it’s not perfect. I still have to rinse and repeat, but the second shampoo, the lather is sooo good. Finally I have found a shampoo that works with my daughters oily hair. She washes her hair every other day now and the shampoo holds up. She only needs to use a very little amount to so it is worth the price.",3,3,0

It softens and nourishes dry and brittle hair and it doesn't cost a small fortune. My hair is so dry and this hot oil works great for.  Can't find in stores in my rural area. I've been using this once a week for 3 months. It's easy to use and only adds about 5 minutes to my morning on the day I use it. I don't follow the directions 100%. I have very long hair and have found that this works best for me:Heat up a mug of waterlet the tube sit in the hot water while I wash my face in the shower.Ring my hair out (literally)dump the water out of the mug and squeeze in the contents of the VO5 tubePush my hair down into the mugMy hair will absorb all of the hot oil. Then I run my fingers through for about a minute, maybe two. This works the product up the shaft of hair but leaves the focus on the bottom few inches.Then I rinse and wash my hair. I don't use conditioner on the hot oil day.My hair is a bit greasy that day. But very slight. I must wash it the next day. It helps with the little flyaways that I get, but it's temporary. If I used it twice a week it may work better, but it's a little pricey for me to use a box a week.I've noticed no difference in breakage or split ends. I have shoulder length thick hair, but the ends are brittle and break too easily due to consistent wear n tear from my heating tools (hair dryer and flat iron used daily.) My stylist told me about this product but I didn't want to buy it from her because the product was marked up so much, so I went in search of it a year or two later. I found it at a local store more expensive than online, so I purchased it here.Wow o wow is my hair happy. My hair has a shine that wasn't there before, my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I'm having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways. My hair is noticeably softer to the touch, and easier to manage when I straighten. I'm no longer having to use the flat iron as long.Love love love this product. Buy it once, and I promise you'll want to keep buying. This product used to be part of my hair care regimen a few years ago but it became more and more difficult for me to find it in stores until I didn't find it at all. Recently I tried Amazon and it was there!!! Even though the instructions say to use it once weekly, I used it twice weekly for a month or so until my hair became lustrous and strong, then I use it as suggested to maintain my hair looking healthy.  Not only I notice the difference, but almost everybody around me. It is easy, fast, effective and affordable. Also, my hair is thin and the product does not add unwanted weight. One of those old products that should never disappear from the market. I am dismayed that I cannot find this in local drugstores anymore.  It's such a cheap, effective solution for my moisture-craving hair.  I had changes in hair texture and thickness after a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and this product is part of my arsenal to tame my hair into making it look halfway normal / like other womens' hair.  We all know having medical problems can get expensive and this is one of the cheapest things I have ever done to target the hair issue that works well for me.  I hope they never quit making this. The best products are not always the most expensive--the ones you can't find at drugstores.Being a product junkie and having the tendency of buying more expensive products, I was a bit hesitant about purchasing this product.I've used it for about a month, once every week. Wow. I don't have damaged hair by any means, but I take care of it anyway. I thought my hair was already healthy, but after applying this on my hair for the first time, I Could immediately feel a difference once it air-dried. I love it so much, I ordered this 6-pack. Definitely a must. it is particularly useful to be able to get a quantity of 6 packages, its nice not to have to worry about running out of product...many retail stores don't even carry VO5 Hot Oil so to be able to order this amount is perfect for me...nice tight package, no wasted packing materials.

I’ve been using it for years and love how it works with my curls. There is no heaviness or stickiness after its applied but just soft curls and waves. Love this gel.....never leaves my hair frizzy or hard....but this gel is getting quite pricey!!!! I love and reccomend this product. I saved a little by buying this online. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the product so naturally I wanted to save a little bit.I'm so glad I bought this from this seller and it really does save my hair from extra unwanted damage. If you already have super damaged hair you shouldn't except this product to magically fix your hair. If it is damaged, I would suggest cutting off the dead pieces with trims or actual full on haircuts and minimizing the heat you put on your hair for a couple of weeks if not months.I have slightly damaged hair from years of tugging at it and not properly educating myself on easy ways to take care of my hair. Like brushing it properly and washing it anywhere from every two to three days to help lock in moisture. I didn't expect a quick fix and even then it worked like magic for me.To enhance this product I used oils towards my ends after I properly distributed the heat pretectant. By doing this I can keep my hair straight for about 3 to 4 days. I have very latin hair, (a bit frizzy, not too curly, not too straight and a bit of everything in between) so my hair can naturally hold a curl a lot easier than most women and my curls can equally last about four days. After about two and a half days of having a curl, the curl falls a bit but it looks very natural and still very presentable. I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is GREAT.  It doesn’t give you the gross greasy look, it fluffs up great, I have extra volume, and I get compliments on my hair constantly.  The cream kinds are no good, and the Frizz Eaze type products are too thin and just don’t work.  This is *perfect* and will make your hair look amazing!!!  Use a diffuser dryer, turn your head down towards the floor, and scrunch it dry.  Fluff and put into place. The curls are great and not frizzy.  if they ever discontinue this product then just plan to see me as the “before” picture in the next plus size Pantene commercial haha. This is one of my favorite hair styling products! It makes my frizzy-prone hair smooth, soft, shiny and adds some volume as well. My hair holds its style well when using product too. Good product!

I'm currently recovering from intense chemical damage so my ponytails have been looking pretty awful recently (uneven, short). This product allows me to keep all of my length(!) when I put my hair up and makes it look a lot more full and uniform. I also like that it can open from both sides without breaking - this makes it really easy to remove from my hair without it getting tangled or breaking. I'm glad that I got the 7"" model, because my hair would not have fit in a smaller one. It is barely visible in my hair (~1/2 inch at the top of my ponytail). The clasps are a little tough to open/close and they are made of plastic, so I don't know how durable they will be in the long run, but since they're fairly cheap and come in a 3 pack (and don't get tangled in my hair!), I think I'll get my money's worth out of them. My hair is super frizzy in this picture (I wasn't going anywhere that day), but you get the point. Very happy with my purchase. I used these every day for several years in the late 80s and early 90s.I was really looking forward to getting these before a recent trip.They did get here on time however, they are definitely not as good as they used to be.I could not really get them to hold my hair in place which is odd because my hair is thinner than it was 20 years ago.The teeth on the combs just seem very flimsy.I have about given up on Goody Products all together after this purchase.I purchased some large barrettes at Walmart a while back and one broke the very same dayI know a couple of other people that have had similar experiences with Goody Products.It is too bad that so few things are of the quality that they once were.A wild back I purchased some Scunci Banana clips here on Amazon from a third-party seller.The quality of those was definitely superior to the goody Brand.Unfortunately I have not been able to find those in a 6 or 7 inch length.Last night I ordered one made by Vidal Sassoon and I will post a review when I receive it. I have very thick, curly hair and using a regular hair tie makes it look like I have a pom-pom on the back of my head. This is perfect, I like how it makes my hair look together and makes my hair look a bit longer and fuller. Those that have complained that these come undone easily may have not noticed that the ends don't clasp interchangeably! One end has a bit that is circular and is meant to stay in place. The other end looks slightly different, like a tab. I've attached pictures of what I mean.The first two pictures are of the end that should open and clasp and be at the top, the last picture is the rounded end piece and should be kept locked and at the bottom. These aren't like the banana clips I wore in the 80s which were pretty sturdy... they are VERY thin/flexible and are the ugliest colors- battleship gray, brown (at least they don't even pretend to be 'horn'), and milky white. I wasn't expecting much and that's exactly what I got.I have fine hair- but a lot of it. So far the brown clip works pretty well, but only if I put some gel in my hair first, else my hair slides out of it. The length is good (long) but I'm dubious as to how well the clip action is going to work... because they are so flimsy I'm betting that the 'ball and socket' closure is going to wear out pretty quickly.  I loved banana clips in elementary school. I was pleased to find these by Goody on Amazon. I needed them to create a side swept hairstyle with curls. My hair is thick and bobby pins alone don't work.  I needed the security of a clip. These held up my thick, wavy hair so well I wanted to bust out in an 80's jam...ok maybe not, but I was very satisfied. 😉 They seem pretty durable, but if you're like me and have thick hair they don't hold it very tight. My hair is a little past my shoulders, so not that long. It could hold it all, but didn't feel tight enough. It's was very loose. If they were stronger I would give them a five star. The colors are exactly the same. These are wonderful ... I had to place my order twice, (first delivery was lost somewhere and I did receive a prompt refund).  Just like the ones I remembered from many years ago.  I read other reviews on this item and wasn't sure if they would be strong enough to hold my hair.  So far not a problem and with my thick hair, the seven inch clips are plenty big.  I put them in my hair while my hair is still wet, which makes things a lot easier.  I will definitely buy these again and since I couldn't find these at any local retailers, including hair salon retailers, I will use Amazon.",5,5,0

There is no use commenting on the price because it is what it is. If you consider how much professional hair styling and coloring is, as well as high quality heat tools, it is reasonable. Her hair is quite healthy because she does not heat style it often. She does love the brush and it was a nice holiday gift to her. I was worried it might be a knock off but it is not. It is firm enough to massage the scalp a bit and distribute the oils and detangle her thick beautiful hair. It’s a nice high end item. So I have long (a few inches past my bra) hair that is very thick, and due to several factors, also very fine.  This is a nightmare combo for detangling - I have recently been using the ""Wet"" brand detangling hairbrushes, but it still feels like I am ripping through my hair.  Rake combs just don't get in-between the fine hair enough to properly detangle.  I'll add in here that my hair & skin are chronically dry, and I seem to always have this section of hair about 3/4 down that is unmanageable, regardless of my split ends.  Adding in product helps with detangling, but weighs my hair down.I researched this brand a bit after several friends recommended, and yes, it's more expensive than any hairbrush I've bought, but the company has a solid reputation for quality and it's warrantied for life. I actually found a MP brush in my grandmother's cabinet from decades ago & it's in perfect shape, even after being through dozens of kids & grandkids.This detangling brush goes right through my hair, detangles everything without product, and feels amazing on the scalp (and I have a sensitive scalp that is not a fan of bristly brushes).  It's also fantastic for getting all of my hair up in a ponytail or bun (I have other MP brushes now, but this one really grips and holds all of my hair up without having to use any pressure - I smooth with the popular mixture brush after pulling up the hair with this one).  I don't blow dry my hair, but I do get a respectable amount of volume when I brush it after it's air-dried a bit as well.The brush is solidly built, appears legit compared to my other MP brushes.  The packaging is attractive, they've clearly retained their older branding & it stands out nicely - I'll definitely keep the boxes for travel or storage (also, keep your packaging & receipt because they are lifetime warrantied & you may be asked for it if you request repair/replacement).  It comes with a nylon cleaning brush which does seem to work effectively.  There was some red residue on the brush from the packaging insert, but it wiped off easily.If you have oily hair, or don't want the natural bristles in the other MP brushes, this would be a great everyday brush.  It is enjoyable to use and gets right through my hair without pulling or snagging, whether my hair is wet or dry.  It feels solid in my hand and is a handsome brush to look at.  My hair is noticeably smoother than even a few days ago with almost no product.  I've used cushioned paddle-style brushes before & this definitely has a softer hold.  If you do blow-dry your hair, I probably would also incorporate a vented, non-cushioned brush to avoid damaging the MP brush with product or direct heat - but I've also got less need to blow dry after using this one.Overall, I really love this brush. I will probably also buy this for my long & curly-haired niece since it is that gentle of a detangler.  The cost is absolutely worth is (as are the more expensive natural-bristled MP brushes), and it's a very effective brush that should last for years.  It will need to be properly cared for (it should not be submerged b/c of the vented cushion and exposure to lots of product or heat will degrade the bristles & bed), but that's been the case with any high-quality beauty product.  I've since bought other MP brushes & combs and have been similarly impressed. This brush is a replacement for a previous Mason Pearson brush, which is slightly damaged and beat up after 20+ years of banging around in my purse and car.  Yes, the price seems excessive.  However, this is a high quality brush and the only one I have found that can gently detangle wet hair without breakage.  I have coarse, naturally wavy silver hair and am careful not to cause damage with blow dryers and cheap brushes.  I highly recommend this brush. It's hardly necessary to add another 5 star review for this brush, but the brush is so fantastic that I wanted to add my voice to the chorus of others saying so. Assuming mine isn't the first review you've read, you've heard the brush is great, and I'm guessing that you, like me, are wondering if it's REALLY worth the price tag. I did too. And you might also be trying to find some tidbit of information to convince a reluctant spouse that buying a $200 hair brush isn't insane, which, let's be honest, it is, as my husband repeatedly told me. What convinced me really had nothing to do with the brush and everything to do with a general frustration buying crap. There are certain products that have risen to the top of their industry but that command a price premium - think Dyson vacuums, Vitamix blenders... the Mason Pearson is one of them. I have bought dozens of lousy hairbrushes in my life, most of them around $10. Sometime about a year ago, I splurged on a $40 brush that claimed to be ""as good"" as the Mason Pearson. It's not. It's essentially the same lousy brush with a hefty price tag. And when I think of all the money I've spent on brushes, it's considerably more than $200, and had I bought this first I would have saved money and aggravation and had a better product all along. I have no idea what part of ""brush science"" makes this brush different, but it feels AMAZING to brush your hair with it.So, here's what happened - I agonized over buying this. I read every review I could find. They all said essentially what I'm saying - it's the best brush, we're not sure why, but you should just trust me and buy it. So eventually, I did. The day it arrived my husband came over to watch me open it, naturally curious what in the world could possibly make a brush cost so much. And I think more than likely waiting with an ""I told you so"" chambered for when the brush inevitably was just a brush and nothing more. I ran it through my hair and immediately noticed a difference. It's is just so perfectly comfortable and it feels like the brush is actually massaging your scalp when you use it. I was standing in my kitchen, not in front of a mirror, but my husband remarked immediately at how silky and shiny my hair was - from ONE use. If I saw the scene play out in a commercial I would have said it was absurd, but it's true. One use, and my hair was so much softer and shinier that my husband noticed. I've been using for a couple of months now and I'm in love. Brushing my hair is something I look forward to.I have long, thick, wavy hair that I straighten, and it works great for me. I have a 7 year old with very long, thick straight hair and a 5 year old with medium length straight thin hair and it works well through all the different textures and lengths and they beg me to use it.The only thing I would say is that this is not the right brush to use on wet hair. I use a Wet Brush for that, which is no where near as nice as the Mason Pearson, but the instructions that came with it specifically said not to use it on wet hair and I believe them. I will be buying one of these for my daughters as they get older, because it will last their whole life and the earlier they get one the less they'll waste on cheap drugstore brushes. Every other brush I've ever used feels like running sticky fingers through your hair. Buy this one. You'll love it. Everyone in my family is obsessed with Mason Pearson hair brushes. They last for about 15 years (depending on use) and they’re the easiest, albeit expensive, gift to give! Great Product - Great Value",4,4,0

The clip hinges are nice and springy, but the overall clip is kind of flimsy -- not ""snappy"" or ""grabby."" This is excellent if you normally get your hair tangled or stuck in other clips, but I found that they like to slip right out of my hair. They have small ""teeth,"" more like ""texture nubs,"" for ""gripping,"" but this really didn't do anything for me. Still slipped right out of small, looped sections of dry hair.Also, the shape is somewhat odd... I wasn't expecting ""metal alligator clips,"" which pull and get stuck in my hair, but these are almost like old school banana clips from the '80s.To sum it up: A very gentle clip. Definitely not strong hold for styling, but won't tangle or pull your hair. For my purposes, it isn't strong enough. I wanted really big hair clips, because I have a lot of hair. I'm trying not to use chemicals in my hair anymore, so I want to start using good conditioners, but there's no way I'd be able to use anything with my hair flipping and flopping everywhere. They're plastic, but they feel strong, and have a strong grasp. They have little nubs inside, not exactly teeth, just grip nubs. And they're much bigger than I was expecting.Only thing I wish was for 10 dollars, I wish they maybe included more. Even four would have been a better value. But overall, I'd suggest these. I was looking for clips to layer off my hair for styling. I saw these with so many good reviews, so I ordered them. However,I suppose because I have such thick hair, it really wouldn't secure my hair, even when using a smaller section. They are much longer than I expected, and they are a little thick for my taste, especially on the bottom. They would be a lot better if they were a little shorter, because then the force of the clamp wouldn't be lost at the ends. If I could get them in my hair, hair towards the end of the clip would fall out because it wouldn't clamp together. A little disappointed, but I'm keeping them because I'm only using it to partition my hair, and not for an actual style. I make ribbon hair bows and got these to help out holding the ribbon together so I can tie it. They work Ok but they are pretty loose not a very tight grip so I don't really think they would work well for hair. They are also not lined up very well. I am satisfied with these large clips. Keep in mind that they are quite large and wide, nearly six inches long, and more than twice the width of typical, skinny silver clips. Three of these clips should be enough to clip up the hair of nearly anyone - one for each side, and one for the back. They hold fairly well and release the hair without pulling the hair. The arch makes them comfortable against the scalp. No problems. Not as described. Granted there are only 3 clips, but the quality is fantastic. They don't pull my hair out when I remove them, and actually unless you have a ton of hair, 3 will be plenty if you are doing something basic, which is all I needed it for. I highly recommend. One note though, I received three black clips, not pink-white-black, but I don't care about the color so it's not a big deal just a side note if color is important to you. I have thick, long hair and was hoping to find sectioning clips to put my hair up when I'm drying/straightening it.  I thought these were supposed to have a strong spring, but when i put a section of my hair in it, it doesn't even close, and my hair slides out of the open end.  Plastic seems kinda cheap and the springs are not strong at all.  I would say these are not worth the price.",1,3,-2

Once your hair is dry, loosen the twists and voila! you got full body curly hair and ready to show the world!

The closest I could get to soft relaxed curls that would hold was 'Curl Talk' but it always seem to just get weighed down after one use or just lose hold if you so much as shook your head. The 'Marc' gives shape, holds well with some hairspray, and doesn't seem to 'grease' up the curls. For me, my hair had more body and definition. I think I have a new favorite curl cream. I was very impressed with this product. It gave me curl instantly as soon as I a plied it to my hair, but once it dried it gave me extreme volume. I kind of look like a Chia pet.

This is amazing stuff. I wash my hair and put in leave-in conditioner and then use this on top to lock it in and keep out the frizz.

I found two brushes whose style reminded me most of that old plastic brush with the bright red cushion; the Isinis and the Mason Pearson.  I decided to go with the Isinis only because some of the reviews indicated that the Mason Pearson brush fell apart far too soon and for the amount of $$$ they were asking for, this seemed like my best bet.Words cannot express how positively thrilled I am by this brush!  I love the plastic paddle, it's a nice shiny black and extremely light weight which means no wrist fatigue.  The rows of bristles are spaced out well in bundles that are fairly compact but firm.  The bristles penetrate down to your scalp which is exactly what you want/need from a boar bristle brush in order to effectively distribute your hairs natural oils.  My hair is near waist length and extremely healthy/naturally shiny to begin with, so I didn't expect a hairbrush to make such a difference but WOW!  It smooths my hair down without the need of additional heat or styling tools and it gives my hair even more of a sheen then it already had - did not think that was possible!This is an extremely well constructed brush and I see it lasting me many years with proper care and cleaning though I am contemplating stock piling a few just in case I'm not able to find this same brush again in the future (seriously, I love it that much!)  I also purchased their ball tipped brush in red because I knew there would be times I'd need a regular denman style brush to untangle my tresses and I wanted a matching set.  It's equally as beautiful and I'll write a review for that later, but if there is one brush to get, it would be their Pure Boar Bristle Brush. Crazy about this brush.  So my hair had some trauma this year and needed a little TLC.  I got some advice that I needed to wash it less, get rid of my plastic brushes, prevent breakage at night (sleep caps or satin pillow cases), deeper nourishing conditioners.  Well I went a little overboard on the boar bristle brushes but I fell for this brush.  The bristles are firmly in the cushion.  I clean it out at the end of every day with a comb through the bristles.  My hair looks shiny and gorgeous.  It seems to have a bit more body to it.  Since I am not shampooing it every day -- which was a terrifying notion to me -- I have fine wavy hair and am afraid of greasy head issues.  The boar bristle brush redistributes the natural sebum that the head produces through the hair, making the hair less dry, and shinier and the scalp less greasy.  Also the boar bristles make the hair less dirty, the bristles clean the dirt out.Once a week I rinse the brush with cold water and let it air dry over night.  The handle is great in my hand.  The bristles feel fabulous against my head like a stimulating massage to awakening some of my sleeping hair follicles.According to the 'experts' I consulted if you have thicker or curlier hair, or denser hair you should use a combination of boar and synthetic bristles.  If you have fine to normal hair the straight up boar bristles should suit you fine.  I am so impressed with how my hair looks with this brush I went online and ordered the small purse size of this brush as well as I was carrying around the large brush with me everywhere. Hello~ Toxic stink off gassing- even worse when washing brush- extremely disappointed with seller “Alrossa” & their complete lack of customer service.No apologies, no response to my requests to pull their stock & at least test one, rinse it and deal with it appropriately, rather than letting it go for it to make another customer sick with migraine & lose a day’s work. I gave them three email opportunities to address the problem and Protect Their Customers; not wasting time for another- but I still want to protect YOU- hence more time to write this email.Alrossa is giving Isinis a bad name; and clearly do Not care about us human beings.Horrible. Btw I’ve bought a smaller & the same size Isinis brush previously and loved them.These are a toxic fail and either fakes, or results of a manufacturing problem. Any brush should be non-toxic and safe; let alone this $50 brush.Please don’t make the same mistake I made. This brush is easy to hold, is full-size (not purse-size), has long stiff bristles that easily go through the hair and onto the scalp.  It does not break your hair and is good for any type of hair including fine hair.  It's easily washable, so you can use styling products without damaging the hairbrush.  I highly recommend you invest in this hairbrush, which is well-constructed and will last many years. I have owned this brush since 2015 and it's still functional. Despite that, it seems tired so I thought it was time to buy a new one. Remarkably, the price has dropped by more than $10 since I originally bought it. I was looking at all the others. I have a collection of hair brushes that don't work well with my hair -- too soft, too hard, too plastic. I know this one works because I've been using it for years. SO I'm buying another one. It's probably not great for really thick hair, but it's perfect for my long, fine, silky hair.It is exactly what I wanted. I have a 25-year old Mason-Pearson brush that has finally begun to show its age by refusing to come clean no matter what I do. I wanted a slightly softer brush and I was not about to spend the kind of money Mason-Pearson is asking these days. This got great reviews and is a wonderful brush which does not pull my hair out. It is a great brush for someone with my kind of long, fine, silky, easily-broken hair. If you have thicker, harsher hair, you probably want a stiffer brush.For me, this one is perfect.",2,3,-1

This is the original aqua/ blue container. ( If you know, you know!) The Black container is a different formula made without Chitosan… which I imagine is the ingredient tray actually holds your curls  together.I have 3B curls that are impossibly frizzy without proper product and care. Aqua blue container Tigi Curls Rock is the ONLY product that really works!!!!! This was the REAL deal!!! YAY!!! Don’t be fooled by the other stuff in the black container… it’s just pasty goo that gives you dandruff. I bought several of these and it was on point every time. This seller runs out often so, whenever I see this in stock I buy it.( Really wish TIGI would get a clue and listen to the outcry for a return to this original formula!!!)Until then… I just keep my fingers crossed TGAT I’ll be able to get this original product. I have been using this for about 15 years.  It has been harder to come by as of late, but it is the only product that tames my curly hair without making it sticky or stiff. The price has gone up a lot (just like everything else) Title sums it up. Stuff won't come out of bottle. Rip off! Not original size totally not worth the price!!! I love this stuff!  I have thick, course curly hair and I love this stuff!  It really defines and holds my curls and keeps the frizz away too!  I wish it wasn't so expensive though!  If I found another product that was cheaper I'd buy it but so far this is the only thing that has really worked with my thick hair. This product is definitely a keeper! I have very curly VERY frizzy hair, and a lot of it! This product is the only one I've found that works in 26 years of looking. It completely gets rid of the frizz, amplifies my curls, and keeps it well contained and under control all day long. I live in central Florida and it can get very windy here, but when I have this in my hair it doesn't matter, even the wind can't frizz it.When you use a lot of it your hair will get stiff, but that goes away as the day goes on. I have to use three ""pumps"" of this product to make sure I get all of my hair, including the inside and the ends (be sure to get the ends, that's where the frizz starts). My hair dresser recommended this product and she said that one container will last a year but because I have so much hair it lasts me about a month and a half to two months.The only thing I feel they could improve on is making the bottles bigger, but if you buy the 2-pack on amazon.com each bottle is cheaper than buying it at the beauty parlor or hair dresser (cheaper by $2-$4).This product is one in a 5-product line of Tigi Catwalk Curls Rock. I have also purchased the shampoo and conditioner but I have not yet used them (trying to get rid of my old stuff). There is also a styler and a hairspray, which I also have not used. But I feel that with this amplifier you don't need the styler and the hairspray.In conclusion, I give this product five stars with my only negative comment being that I wish the bottles came in a bigger size. All in all, perfect for curly, frizzy hair and also good for newly permed hair (my roommate has permed hair and uses this product as well). My family has a variety of hair weights and textures (fine to coarse, wavy to curly) and this product works well for all of us. The key is to not use too much-- a little goes a long way! When an appropriate amount is used and worked through the hair consistently, it air-dries soft with formed curls and not crunchy. We love it! If you're looking for something that adds curl and reduces frizz, this is it. I've been using this for 13 years now and it's all I'll ever use. Excellent Product",5,1,4
