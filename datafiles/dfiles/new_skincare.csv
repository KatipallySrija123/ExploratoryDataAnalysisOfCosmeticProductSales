0,B000PHP8L4,"Recomendado I want to start off saying that I love this spf, I really do.  However nowhere on the product info does it say Octinoxate is in the ingredients.  I have bought this twice thinking it is a mineral spf as it only mentions zinc in the ingredients in the description.  I kept my first bottle because it really is a great spf however I want to use only mineral spf, not chemical.  I went looking for another Elta MD mineral sunscreen and somehow bought this one again!  I read through the entire description and it didn't say anything other than zinc.  If you're ok with chemical sunscreens, this is honestly a great choice.  I feel like I've been duped twice somehow thinking I was buying a mineral sunscreen, and this isn't it. This is the only sunscreen I really love. I wear it daily. I’ve tried at least 50 sunscreens from cheap to ungodly expensive. This is decent price point for the amount you get. I like that it’s a combo sunscreen with zinc and a chemical filter, no fragrance, and it blends in quickly. Like others have said the pump sucks. Just give me a tube or something. I have to pull the pump up when it gets stuck down. Huge fan of all Elta MD products and have been using them for years. However, with the last 2 orders of the 7 oz body lotion, the pump stopped working and I had to transfer the still very generous contents to a plastic container. Anyone else having the same issue or can offer a better solution? The pump, like other users have said, quits working. It only worked for a short time, pretty much just past the return window. Otherwise, a great sunscreen for sensitive skin, just a crummy pump. I contacted the manufacturer and they said to turn it upside down and let it stand for awhile. Then pump a few times to prime. That seems to fix it, so I’m happy with it again. Love that this sunscreen does not smell like sunblock and is so easy to apply.  Only negative is its not water resistant, but it is more of an everyday use.  My daughter loves it . The best sunblock I've ever found, suitable for sensitive skin. My favorite sunscreen. it feels just like lotion. it works well, too. it's just so expensive."
1,B000KPO99I,"I have been using this for years . And literally the same jar for years because a little goes a long way. A few dabs on the finger you can moisturize you’re entire face and neck. I love how this feels on my skin. It’s important to put a night cream on every night and this is the go to cream . Love it ! Great price! My face! Good product I've been using for 2 years. Less product than described. Description says 2.5 ounces.  This jar says 50 ml, which is 1.69 oz which is 67% of what is promised. Using this for years Moisturizer Feels great.  I don't notice any difference yet but love the way it makes my skin feel and it doesn't smell bad"
2,B00016XJ4M,"Am in love with this .definitely buying again I never write reviews about skin care products because no matter how many different ones I try (high end or affordable), I don't notice anything great worth mentioning. This toner though, I think has just simplified my routine by so much.For reference, I have acne-prone, combination skin (oily forehead and t-zone, normal to dry on rest) and have adult acne especially around that time of the month. Aside from cleansing, I've only been using this toner and one moisturizer (I switch those up depending on how my skin feels) every morning and night. On rare occasions my skin feels hydrated enough, I really only put this toner on and that's it.What I like about using this is that it doesn't do anything extraordinary nor does it cause any problems. It keeps my face looking NORMAL and controlled. Which is really all I need, and my skin just feels good. My breakouts have been very minimal aside from the ones in the chin area due to hormones every month. I have noticed my face overall looks significantly brighter and clearer- I think I recognized this difference about a couple of weeks in first trying it. I used to have a lot of redness which felt like they were permanently there and won't go away. Now it's only a bit red around the nose and chin area.For application, I don't use cotton pads; I think it's a bit unnecessary as it soaks up a lot of product. I put a tiny puddle in my palm (always with clean hands) and slap it on. The consistency is like water but I never have the problem of it running down my arm. On drier days, I put on 2-3 layers of this (pat in, let absorb, put some more on), after that my skin feels super hydrated.The smell isn't anything to praise about, but it's nothing that will keep me away from using it either. This isn't a perfume, and as a skin care product, I would be worried if it did smell like one. If you've smelled real flowers, they smell good, but there's sometimes that slight underlying scent that might be not as pleasant. To me, that's what this toner smells like. It does smell of roses, but it has that touch of realness (how do you even describe this). I don't find it terrible at all.At the price, it's really worth giving it a go if you're looking for a good, basic toner to start your skin care routine. Going in I knew nothing about this toner other than the amount of reviews it has on Amazon and one youtube video of someone praising it, and I'm VERY glad I tried it. One bottle kept me good for 5 months (I already have my backup bottle ready). I bought my first bottle of the rose petal at the beginning of May this year, and I'm now about to finish up the last few drops. As long as my skin doesn't suddenly decide to react differently to it, I think I'm going to be keeping this toner as a staple for a long, long time.Update (a couple of years later..):Just wanted to add I still love this toner. And contrary to my old review above, using the toner with a cotton pad has been a game changer. Using it by itself was great as well, but I tried using it with a cotton pad to gently wipe the face and within a couple of weeks, the texture of the skin got better on another level. Let's start with my skin type. As a fellow online shopper, I think it's important to know the reviewers skin type so I can compare with my own. SUPER OILY.How oily? Let's put it this way. On average I use 4-6 oil blotting papers each time to remove shine. I do this 2-3 times a day to not look like butter. My supposedly long lasting 15-h foundation only lasts 2 hours before melting and I don't use eyeliner (even though I would love to!) because my eye lids melt everything; pencil, gel, powder, liquid. Anything. That is how oily I am. To add to my problems, I also have mild acne. I treat this with benzoid peroxide face wash, retinoid cream, and benzoid peroxide gel daily. I am simply adding the toner to my routine so any results or side effects are achieved with a combination of products. I will report as accurately as possible.Now back to the product.Day 1: I received the package very quickly and at first I was a little apprehensive because the liquid looked like baby oil inside the bottle. Later at night, I finally opened it and I was wrong. The toner is very light, non-greasy, and smelled like roses. The smell was a bit strong when I first poured it on a cotton pad, but about 5 minutes after application, 95% of the smell went away. So for those who are worried about the scent, it goes away quickly! After applying the toner on my face I felt very clean and normal. I say normal meaning I didn't fee dry and I didn't feel oily either. It was great. I followed quickly with my usual moisturizer and voila. Done.Day 2: I woke up and my face was not as oily as before, pre-toner. Upon washing my face, it felt softer and smoother. Definite plus. After using the toner only once, I am already feeling a difference. Overall, my skin feels cleaner and less heavy with oil. If your goal is to find something to clean and sooth, this toner does a pretty good job. As for pore sizes or acne, I will have to update after I've used the products for a few weeks. I'm going to add the toner to my routine twice a day as recommended and will update soon!One Month Later: I have lowered my use to once a day, at night, to clear away any excess dirt or makeup that was overlooked by the makeup remover + face wash. Aside from what I mentioned earlier, I did not notice any additional benefit of this toner. It definitely does help keep my pores cleaner but after a while, I still need to use clay masks or nose strips to remove the blackheads. Overall, I would say that using this toner wouldn't hurt. I observed no negative reactions and it's quite affordable as a toner for only $10!Recommendations: For anyone looking for a general toner that covers all your bases, I would recommend this one due to its low costs and large quantity. (After one month, I barely used half the bottle.) For anyone looking to target anything specific like oiliness, acne, pores, etc, I would recommend to possibly keep shopping. Let me be clear that this toner is not bad, in fact, it's a lot better than other toners I've tried because it didn't dry out my skin, but it also did not fulfill the hopes that I had when trying it. If you have relatively good skin, go for it. This one is both good for your wallet and skin. It has been such a relaxing experience using this toner. I love the smell and enjoyed the results. I feel more cleaning skin and great results after use. It something I recommend to my family and friends and always keep a bottle in my home."
3,B001DJ9JJU,"Very moisturizing I love this moisturizing oil.  I use it every night and every morning under my cream moisturizer. Can’t live without it. I can also use it on my cuticles and my hair. Although a bit expensive, I'm willing to try one bottle of product. I love it. I’m on my second bottle and just bought 3 friends a bottle. I put body lotion in my hand and add a few drops of Josie Marian’s  Argan oil. My skin has never been smoother. There are other options also. This product is wonderful. I like the lightness of this oil - and it takes very little to cover my entire face and neck I used this several years ago and going back to it. Love it! Excellent product. As well as the whipped Argon oil for your body. Always smells fresh and my sling just soaked it up. Great for nails and hair! Love this product! This oil is amazing for my skin.  It gives softness, radiance, and comfort without any grease or breakouts.  I've tried other argan oils but so many are watered down, or diluted with cheap ingredients, they're just junk.  I know Josie Maran's argan oil is 100% pure, highest quality oil.  It has no scent, and it's surprisingly lightweight.  Since I need only several drops to moisturize my whole body (seriously!), I feel this is an excellent buy. You might find cheaper argan oil, but it may be from low quality fruit or fruit from genetically reproduced trees (which are fantastic, of course, but they may not even be in Morocco.  The genetically modified and reproduced argan forests, if grown away from the traditional argan location in the Atlas Mountains, take much profit away from the companies that farm and harvest the trees in their endemic location. REAL Argan Oil is ALWAYS produced in Morocco. There are businsses making huge profits on what they claim is argan oil, but so many have been found to have added sunflower and or olive oil, diluting the argan oil. Argan oil is the most expensive oil in the world. Real argan oil costs $300 USD per liter.  So if you're finding ""real"" 100% undiluted argan oil for cheap prices, you might want to check it out very thoroughly before you use it. There are claims that even Ecocert certification passes diluted, impure argan oil. Yes, it may be 100% organic, but is it 100% pure, unadulterated argan oil? It can be organic sunflower or olive oil too. Argan oil for skin has no added fragrance, so if your product has a perfumey fragrance, right there you know it's not ""pure"". The argan tree take 14 years to bear fruit, which its oil is so precious and rare. The Moroccan Women's co-ops that work with Maran's company are dedicated to responsible harvesting practices and reforestation projects, which - along with environmental protection policies – keep Argan forests and women's jobs safe. I'm sticking with Josie's because of the stringest testing and requrements. She's staked her company on the authenticity and effectiveness of argan oil, so I feel confident I'm getting high quality, organically grown, chemical free, pure oil."
4,B0014UCJPO,"I bought this because I like natural things over all other brands with a lot of chemicals , I use it once a week , my oil has went down on my t-zone and I definitely notice a change in my skin I have combination skin and I use a clay mask twice a week to help with oil control and to do a deep clean. Overall, this is a good clay mask, an option to try if you like to make your own mask.Preparation: I find that 1 tablespoon clay and a tablespoon water (as instructed by the packaging) yields they a very thick mask (see picture). I prefer to use less than a tablespoon of clay with more than a tablespoon of water to get the right consistency and quantity for me, The clay mixes easily with water.Application: This clay is slippery and very tricky; if you get a too thick consistency it's very hard to spread on the face, if it's a little too watery you get an uneven application.Wear: The clay doesn't really dry out completely (even if I only use just water) so it's not uncomfortable while it's on the face. It also doesn't leave dust all over the house if I move around while wearing it.Cleaning: Some clay masks are very hard to remove, but this one just glides of the face. But I always remove clay masks in the shower.Dryness: After & remove it my skin is not left dessert dry, like some clay mask do. But for very dry skin it's still worth mixing it with an face oil.Cleaning: In terms of removing impurities, I would say it only removes 80% of impurities. It also dries out some pimples.Since it yields a thick but somewhat slippery consistency, I think it would also be great for wraps. good product I purchased this to use as a face mask. For a long time, I used bentonite clay. However, I find it to be too drying and my skin is just way too sensitive for bentonite. After reading tons of reviews on all the best clays, I settled on this one. I DEFINITELY prefer it over bentonite. It doesn't pull stuff out as well as benny clay, but it's soooo much gentler on my skin. It still does work to clear pores, but it is a slightly slower process compared to bentonite.The BEST feature about this, though, is that you don't need to mix it with apple cider vinegar. I don't mind mixing benny clay and ACV, but it's so much more convenient to be able to mix this with water. It forms a great paste.I use equal parts clay and water (sometimes more water is necessary). I only use about a half-tablespoon, as I don't think this mask needs to be super thick on your face to get the job done.Apply all over or in troubled areas, wait for upwards of 45 mins (I like it to be VERY dry before taking it off, although that's not everyone's preference and drying time depends on the thickness/wetness of the mix), and then rinse off. Your face will be red where the mask was, but that's totally fine. However, if you experience itching, swelling, or discomfort after removal, there may be an issue and you should stop using.Love this stuff! I like doing a mask weekly and it exfoliates and cleans my skin really well! I actually use this in my professional facials, it is a great way to detox your skin, it also will minimize your pores and the anti aging effects helps you tighten your face and gets rid of fibe lines and wrinkles with regular use. My favorite product  to use by far!!!! You can actually feel it working. The differenceis Instantly noticeable, and ur skin feels great. I honestly  recommend  to use it once or up to 2x a week depending on how you feel about it. But my regular clients noticeable real results with weekly use. I love to use this at home on my own face as well and use it once to 2x a week depending on the need for it. I have really sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate my skin at all. All u need is a thin layer. Ur skin will thank u. Producto en excelentes condiciones I like this clay mask and I love how it tightenings my face as it dries on and it is so easy to mix and I have a special little bowl and a wooden spoon too and I just what I feel is the amount I need to use.  It takes 10 minutes then is tight and itchy too but I love it weird I know also when it starts to flake from drying.  I like the price too and all these products do not need to be so expensive either so I find the products that are less are really good too.  I used the Glamglow product 60 dollars and it did nothing for me I just paid for the name so sometimes less is more. Wow this stuff is awesome! Leaves my skin feeling so fresh and soft. I didn’t notice a smell to it nor any side effects like redness, irritation, burning or itchyness which is great because I have very sensitive skin. Product dried quickly once applied. The only thing I did not like about this product which is why I knocked off 1 star is the fact that it is very messy to remove and flakes everywhere so I don’t advise using just water over the sink. Definitely remove the thick chunky parts with a damp cloth or paper towel and then what ever is left finish off with just water."
5,B001AD0HL8," This is great for a lot of things. If ur going thru chemo u definitely want to use it because chemo sucks out ur minerals. If your consipated it will help you go. Leg cramps the list is endless Magnesium oil, when rubbed directly into a sore muscle or at the bottom of your feet gets into the system much faster than a pill. This magnesium is great for muscle craps, stops them almost immediately upon applying it. I apply evening and morning. Been using it for 3yrs now and will continue. recommended by my chiropractor It worked very quickly. A little goes a long way, so don’t spray too much. Definitely relaxes you. I like the feeling it gives my skin. I’m still trying to train myself to get in the habit of using it but I think it’s been helping my skin and some other symptoms of low magnesium I’ve been experiencing. If I was more consistent I’d probably see clearer results. Muscle"
6,B0018RF4IW,"I've used Skin Obsession products for 10 years. They are the best, the most affordable, highest quality and their customer service is excellent. I’ve used this product three times, in conjunction with NeedCrystals Microdermabrasion Crystals Skincare Booster. And everytime I use it I wake Up with clearer skin! I tend To have mild sub clinical acne, it’s like I always Have at least 3 pimples, and the discoloration stays on my face for a while. I can Already see incredible progress, there are no bumps on my face anymore! Normally I have Small skin colored bumps on my forehead, clogged pores. I’m pleasantly surprised with this mask! I feel Like in no time I’ll have smooth and even tone skin! Bonus that it smells delicious. It’s somewhat difficult to wash off, probably would help to wash it in the shower. I've used Skin Obsession's glycolic acid and loved the potency of it. I'm a licensed esthetician and have used pumpkin masks and peels before. This can stand in line with some of the costly ones and has a good price point. I had to use very little, so I could see this product lasting a long time. There was some tingling as expected when I first applied and then it dried quickly and left my skin feeling nice and tight. If you're not used to using glycolic acid or have  pumpkin before, I would recommend leaving it on for the shorter duration and increasing the time gradually. This also came with a free sample of  exfoliating crystals which are absolutely amazing and i will be purchasing those as well. Overall i love this brand's chemical exfoliants and would recomend. Worked just like if I went to the spa to get it done I have used this product many times over the last two years and recently reordered my fifth (maybe sixth?) jar. It's peeling effect is minimal unless you are using it for your first peel. I use it for maintenance and for hydration as I use much stronger products - also from Skin Obsession - for my facial/neck/chest peels. I am 39, with skin concerns including fine lines as well as enlarged pores and oiliness (oy vay)Results to expect. Overall you'll feel a cool tingle as the peel sits and works on your skin. I have never experienced any discomfort from this product. After washing off the product your skin will feel smoother - maybe look a little pink due to the glycolic acid - but that fades quickly.This is a good product that I keep reordering. I notice when it's been a while since I last used it. At 39, my priority is to maintain & preserve my skin. One last word of advice- Use sunscreen on your face after using this product! A gentle one that won't sting. Love this stuff! Excellent light daily glycolic peel. Takes only a thin layer. This will last a while. Leave you skin smooth and clean. Really gets down in the pores. Combine with Skin Essentials Tightening or their Hyaluronic serum for one of the best daily treatments you can get at this pricepoint. I'm hooked. I have an ongoing problem with skin color unevenness and oily skin.  I've tried many types of treatments with some improvement but it does not last.  I remembered that I once had a facial peel containing pumpkin that had worked pretty well.  After reading some reviews online I decided on this product.  I use skin obsession's pumpkin enzyme mask peel every day in the shower after I wash my face(pat face dry before applying) and it seems to leave my skin soft, non-oily, and noticeably leaves my darker areas lightened with no ill effects. So it doesn't solve my problem altogether but it helps as well as anything I've ever tried and is easy to apply and wash off. This was my first time using this product. I used a cotton ball to apply this peel & followed all of the directions properly. As soon as i applied the mask to my skin i felt a bit of a burn ""but in a good way"" i knew that it was working. I left my mask on for 20 minutes and washed it off ""it was not difficult to remove"" i used a face brush & face wash for a thorough clean. I did not see my skin peel & there was zero healing time like other face peels."
7,B000VPPUEA,"I have no complaints about bio oil. It can be pricey but it is worth it if you’re needing it for a specific skin discoloration issue or trying to prevent stretch marks. Even if you choose not to buy it online, I still recommend you get it from a store. I am extremely familiar with this product, it’s been a lifesaver in different points of my life. It was with bio oil that I was able to fade a very dark burn on my face from a bad waxing attempt many years ago. It literally looks like nothing was ever there. I have always used it to fade any dark spots or scars successfully. I don’t like using it on my face as much as my body just because it’s oil, but it has never caused any breakouts for me personally and I know that if I ever have another problem on my face, this works. I have now been using it every day on my belly to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. I am currently 8 months pregnant, only have a few weeks left to go, and still no stretch marks at all. I know if they show up that it will not be this product or anything that is to blame, it will simply be natural cause if my belly grows faster than my skin can keep up with. However I have seen amazing benefits for my skin elasticity. The last three weeks I have been feeling the growing tension and stretch on my belly and belly button, and felt like stretch marks were on the brink of showing, but I’ve been super consistent with applying oil a few times a day and nothing has popped up so far. I know it would’ve been a different story if I wasn’t using anything. I rely heavily on bio oil and sometimes combine it with lavender oil at night, and massage those in. I also use lotion or the Vaseline cocoa body oil gel when running low on this - just trying to extend the use of what I have and keeping my belly moisturised as much as possible throughout the day. I’m sure there are other things you can use to help with extra moisturising if you need it, like applying lotion if you need to go out and don’t want to have oil on your clothes. This is your body, you’re the one who has to live in it and at the end of pregnancy you’ll be glad you did all you could to help with the changes. Some body changes will be inevitable and that’s amazing, you cannot expect your body to be the same when motherhood is such a transformative process and you are growing a life. We should make our peace with all these things, see beauty in it and focus on good health above all, but I also believe it’s best for your mental health to look after what’s important to you and have no regrets. If preventing stretch marks is important to you, don’t neglect it. So I ordered this while pregnant to prevent stretch marks, but I was a mess while pregnant and didn’t really use it lol so I can’t attest to how it works in that way. But OMG. I started using it for my c-section scar after I had the baby and it really works! Then I was reading the bottle one day and saw it mentioned putting it on your face and this is the part I am especially excited about! I have had breakouts since I was a teenager and have never ever been able to make an impressive difference with any product, including those prescribed by a dermatologist. I thought it sounded crazy to put oil on my acne-prone skin but thought hey what the hell lol I added 4-drops to my moisturizer in my hand (I use CereVe), mixed between my fingers, and applied. I didn’t think much of it because I went into using it this way on a whim and with ZERO expectations. Two days later I catch a look of myself in the mirror and noticed how much better my skin looked! And I wasn’t looking for improvement- it was just that obvious to me! After only 3 uses, my pores were smaller and all the gunk I can usually see living inside my cheeks was significantly reduced. I mean, WOW. I’ve been using it religiously for about a month now and am now seeing significant reduction in my acne scars and discoloration from the sun, as well. The fading of the scars/discoloration definitely takes time, but it works like a dream and is worth the wait/commitment. I will buy this stuff for the rest of my life! I haven’t had skin this clear since before puberty, guys! I would happily pay much more for this product because of how good it works, so the price is an awesome bonus. It should last a super long time since you really don’t need much at all. It has a very nice smell- like a powdery clean smell. 10/10 recommend!! I was skeptical to try it but decided to give it a go. I've use it twice a day for about a month or so & I have no complaints. I added this to my cerave products and feel like I've finally found the perfect routine for my skincare. I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.I've also been using this on my c-section scar and it has alleviated the itchiness from the scar 🙌🏻 10/10 I love this! I kept seeing it pop up on social medias so decided to buy and omg I don’t regret it! I’m on my second bottle I also got my nieces one! I have semi sensitive skin especially to some makeup and this cleared my reaction and chemical burns within 2 days! I know some peoples skins are different and react differently but so far this has helped me! Also I have eczema around my nose and eyebrows and this has helped with the dry and flakiness!! This cured very bad seborrheic dermatitis on my face in a matter of days. In 2021, I had 6+ months of a weird rash on my face that seem to elude every doctor. It was so bad that they tested me for lupus (it followed the butterfly pattern). It hurt, itched, was horribly unsightly, and oral steroids were the only thing that got it under control. I found this product in one of many desperate late-night internet searches and bought it on a whim. It literally fixed my rash in 2 days. Now I put it around my eye area and neck every time I get out of the shower and no more problems! Cured! I absolutely would recommend this product tho anyone who had skin discoloration issues. I have some scars as well as hyper potentiation from having a few babies and those stuff is like magic. It doesn't happen overnight but as you use it you will begin to see a noticeable difference in the appearance of your scars, mine nearly vanished after about a month, as did my hyper pigmentation on my upper lip. Check it out, totally worth the price and it smells pretty good too! I’ve been using this oil for about a month, and I’ve notice a slight difference . Yet I’m hoping with continue use it will help me with my uneven skin tone. I’m usually not consistent with beauty products, but I have been with this one. Anyway, it’s worth a try."
8,B000EY4YLS,"I love this stuff, but be warned that this is not going to be a great sunscreen for everyone, which is why I knock this down to 4/5 instead of 5/5. It absorbs well (for me) but looks a lil greasy, even after letting it sit for a moment. It looks greasy, but it doesn't feel greasy, make of that what you will. I personally really like looking glowy without having sticky/moist feeling skin.Another thing: If you have darker skin, this might not be the best product for you :( (and tbh ppl with darker skin are probably already well aware of this possibility with all/most mineral sunscreens, but I just wanna confirm this does in fact leave a white cast) I am pale as snow, so the white cast this leaves on my skin almost works like a tinted SPF (lol).BUT, I believe Blue Lizard has a Sheer SPF that works a lot better for more melanated individuals.This stuff doesn't pill up, even when I use a thick moisturizer underneath it. It looks great when I put makeup on top of it. It stays on basically all day and doesn't budge, I actually have to work it a little to get it off my skin with my cleanser at the end of the day. I use this on my face and my body daily and it has never broken me out or stung my eyes and I have pretty darn sensitive skin. If you need a heavy-duty sunscreen (and again, you either don't mind a white cast or are pale) this stuff is very good!! If you have sensitive skin, and have tried hundreds of sunscreens, try this one. Every sunscreen I’ve ever tried has burned my eyes while wearing it, and while trying to wash it off, it’s burned my eyes even more. But not this one. This one was easy to apply, didn’t burn my eyes while wearing, and while removing it - still didn’t burn my eyes! I stopped wearing sunscreen for a long time because I’ve never been able to find one. But finally, I can stop having the sun damage my skin and I finally found one that works. Just buy it, and try it. In the past I always had a problem with getting sunscreen in my eyes when I workout or play Pickleball. No matter what I did the sunscreen and got in my eyes and was very irritating and painful. Blue Lizard sunscreen solves that problem. No matter how much I sweat, or whether I apply this sunscreen close to my eyes, there's no eye irritation. It's also provides great, long-lasting, protection from the sun. I've been using this product for over a year now and I plan to stick with it. Very happy with this product. I actually found out about this stuff when my sister bought a bottle and brought it home as this one was being shipped. 🙄I'm very fair skinned and burn easily. One might say I'm a vampire, though the sight of blood does not excite me. And because of this I'm either covered head to toe 365 a year or drowning myself in sunscreen.Many of them irritate my skin because as luck would have it, nature blessed me with being sensitive, too. To perfumes and whatever else they're putting in other sunscreen. I can maybe get away with putting some of it on my legs and arms, but never on my face. Anything perfume-y on my face and my eyes swell up and shut tight... I look like I'm turning into a fly, no thank you.I was using Shiseido Sunscreen at one time for all over, until I ran out. It worked very well and I never had an issue. Except it's rather costly and it's got a white cast to beat the band. Yeah. I'm talking full-on clown makeup. Still, no burns, no tan. Hallerlujah!So now I've got Blue Lizard. And it's got a white cast, but it's not terrible. It's also not permanent. It actually disappears after a few minutes - which kind of left me wondering if I was covered still. I checked... my skin is slick so sunscreen is still on me. If there's doubt, the gnats return to start annoying me with their presence.I spend upwards of 3 - 5 hours in the pool every day, unless it's storming. The first hour is walking around in the water vacuuming, so my hands are getting more water exposure than my face is. Rash guards from neck to ankle.Roughly 30 - 45 minutes later, the sunscreen that was on my hands is gone. I believe that the bottle says up to 60 minutes water-resistant (not waterproof! Any sunscreen that claims ""waterproof"" is being deceitful), and I know you're supposed to reapply every 80 for this SPF... but there should be something to let consumers know that water exposure will halve the protection time.Because I reapplied religiously, I never got any kind of sun burn or tan. Somehow my hands magically escaped with my reapplying while wet. But after you let the product dry a bit before you return to your activity, it should work fine.I also had zero irritation - EXCEPT when I went underwater after vacuuming and scooping out nature's little minions for over an hour.This product will run. It will get in your eyes. And it will burn. It doesn't matter if you applied it dry or with damp hands and then let your face dry. If you start sweating or your face gets wet at all and the water goes into your eyes, it's picking up product and taking it to your peepers! This happened so many times over the course of two weeks I thought I was going to lose both of my eyes. At first they just felt dry. But every day it got worse and worse.For this reason I have stopped using it on my face and have started using something else that doesn't run and cause irritation. My eyes were red as fire trucks for over a week, and I have been worshipping the makers of eye drops ever since.The lid changing color to let me know of the UV danger is nice. I don't know how scientifically accurate that is, but it's a good focal for me anyway.So, it's really great stuff as far as I'm concerned. I just know better where to put it now. I recently purchased the Australian Sunscreen mineral sunblock and overall, I am quite pleased with it. One thing to note is that it is not waterproof, only water resistant, so it's important to remember to reapply after swimming or sweating.One downside of this sunscreen is that it can be slightly greasy, which may not be ideal for those with oily skin. Additionally, it can sting the eyes if it gets into them, so be careful when applying around the face.One thing I really appreciated about this sunscreen is that it doesn't leave a white cast on my Asian skin, which is a common issue with many mineral sunscreens. It is also thick and creamy, which makes it easy to apply and spread evenly on the skin.Overall, I would recommend the Australian Sunscreen mineral sunblock for those who are looking for a water resistant, mineral sunscreen that is free of a white cast. Just be aware of its slightly greasy texture and potential to sting the eyes. I really liked this for several reasons:No toxic chemicals, white cast faded quickly, stayed on skin well, good protection"
9,B000F65JSC,"I love this eye cream because it does not have any side effects at all. I have tried many other eye creams and they all made my eyes water and itch badly.It was so uncomfortable. This eye cream is light AND moisturizing plus it goes on very smoothly.Try it and you just might like it. Can’t do without this product. Keeps moisture around and under more eyes. I notice a big difference when I don’t use it. Will keep purchasing!! TRIED OTHER OLAY CREAMS....THIS ONE WORKS BEST AND IS AFFORDABLE I am quite impressed with this product as a highlighter to conceal  dark undereye circles.  But Not impressed as a moisturizer.it dried out my skin . I would not recomend this product. Have been using this for long time. Happy to get it at discount price. More moisturizing than the ultimate cream, but I kind of prefer the ultimate although this is great. I prefer ultimate because I notice it work on under eye lines. Extremely moisturizing and gentle on skin where the ultimate can sometimes burn. Es una crema suave con algo de fragancia, pero no vi resultados mayores. I will say I prefered the Olay de-puffer eye cream I used to buy, but this one is pretty good. This doesn't come in exactly the right color for me, so it doesn't blend as well as I'd like. It still does a good job of moisturing and helping with puffiness and dark circles."
10,B0017JOEVY,"I love the smell and weight of it. I'm a big fan of the Solar RX one with SPF as well. So glad I found Pamela's Bread Mix. This is the best bread mix I have used. You would never know it is gluten free. Makes home-made bread perfectly and is so easy to make. I often add raisons and cinnamon to make raison bread. This is an amazing  moisturizer that is so natural and pure people need to realize when they use the product you can’t touch the edge of the container where the product comes out.  That happened to me once and when I spoke which someone with good knowledge of the company, they mentioned that since there are no preservatives and icky stuff that we try to stay away from, there is a sensitivity to the introduction of bacteria to the bottle, it creates mold.  Please just put the amount you need in your hand and “DON’T” touch where the product exits.  It would be such a good idea if they told people about this, and would probably save hundreds of dollars in returns.  This is my go-to face cream and I will be sticking with it! I have used this for over a decade now. I don't get the reviews that claim mold in it, I have never had an issue.It's great for sensitive and dry skin. Super moisturizing without being oily. It's good for normal skin too. Multiple people in our family use it. It does what it claims it will and more. I used all of the high end products only to end up with many break-outs, the drug store brands too. I went from product to product until I found this one and have used if every since. This is the first product that cleared up my skin and actually moisturized it. It soaks in vs. just sitting on-top as many others do. Our family actually love the smell of it, its not over powering either. My skin breaks out if I use products containing either gluten or soy.  It's not easy to find a moisturizer without either so when this was recommended I thought I'd give it a try.What I like:It doesn't break out my face - that's a big plusI don't have to wear foundation with it and my makeup (powder/blush) goes on smoother and more evenly than ever before.It actually gives my skin a nice glow.It only takes a tiny amount, so value for cost is high.  It's going to last a long while at the rate I'm using it.What I don't like:I don't like the ""woodsy"" smell.  It doesn't linger for very long if I wear makeup. If I don't wear makeup I smell it for a couple of hours and I'm not a fan.It has a greasy feel.  I have dry skin, but somehow this still feels just a bit too greasy.It doesn't have a sunblock effect.  I liked that my previous moisturizer (no longer on the market) had an SPF 15 rating and I miss that element.Overall a good product, but I'll probably try something else when this one is gone. I have major problems skin: aging (44), sensitive and acne prone... when I put on foundation before, my skin would literally suck the moisture out of the foundation and my skin looked dry and dull. so I started using a high rated moisturizer on my face before foundation but it was patchy... then I found this. I've been using for about a month and I have no breakouts plus my skin looks so much better!! no more dryness. my skin looks younger! I love it! Had this lotion for a few days and so far I'm digging it. I have dry skin that gets very flaky, so I need something that can really moisturize. This seems to do the trick. I haven't had any flaking and it makes for a really nice base for my make up. My skin just looks a bit smoother and healthier, so I'm happy!  The only complaint I have is that I don't really care for the smell. Its not a bad smell, but its a stronger smell and it sticks with me for a while after I apply it. I'm happy with the product in all other areas, and will happily continue to use it. Also, side note, I've noticed the eczema that I get on my face has cleared a little bit already. Not sure if its coincidental or not, but I'll be keeping an eye out to see if the eczema continues to clear. If it could do that, it would be a 5 star, hands down! I'm over 50, lived in variable Mid-western weather my whole life.  This is not a moisturizer for people with moderate to oily skin.  I'm using this even as our weather is topping out in the 70-80's and its not too strong.  I have typical T-zone skin.  I use Luminos every night and use this on cloudy days.I by mistake received the Solar Rx, which I don't  care for near as much cause I can feel the SPF30 in it as it's more coating feel and make's putting on make-up a bit more difficult.  But since our sunshine is more variable, I do save it for sunny days. But make sure I wash off at night as it leaving that coating feel.But I do LOVE Luminos, it non-greasy feeling, light almost lemony smell is fleeting and my skin looks really hydrated all the time using it.  I'm very gluten-sensitive and this is the reason I originally was seeking.  But it does do wonders for older skin.  I will be a life-long customer of both."
11,B000PHRIYE,"This is an SPF of 30, which is plenty for my usage.  It has become a part of my morning skin care routine.  I use a couple of skin care serums first, then follow with a quarter teaspoon of sunscreen.  This goes on white but dries down clear, It is highly moisturizing so it replaces a moisturizer.  My skin is mature and dry to combo.  I give it a few minutes to dry down before I put on makeup. There are lighter physical sunscreens out there but they are not nearly as elegant and comfortable and moisturizing. The best sunscreen is the one you'll use and I always use my sunscreen. The first ever sunscreen that does not break me out!  Works as a moisturizer so it is one product and done. My wife love this stuff. They need to bring the big jar back Definitely worth the money! Isn’t greasy, doesn’t leave white streaks and goes on smooth. It’s good to wear under makeup as well. This sun screen is non oily and feels really nice going on. Reccomended by my skin doctor. I love the creaminess without being greasy, no white cast, and no offensive smell. I have tried pretty much every sunscreen out there and this is the winner for everyday use. Wish it could make me look a lot younger than I am My dermatologist recommended that I use this product before going outside. It does not seem to be greasy. I have sensitive skin and it did not bother me at all. I would recommend this product to others."
12,B001BR97A0,"My skin looks very smooth, no break-outs, zero wrinkles, etc. since I've used this product for over a year now. Love it and wouldn't change.  At night I use a small amount of face scrub, rinse, then more of the toner. I used to get professional facial. With  this product don't need them. Love it! And I'm a Grandmother with very smooth skin---I think from this product and nightly face scrub--that's all I do. My family has been using Thayers Witch Hazel for years to reduce inflammation from acne or injuries anywhere on our skin, including in sensitive areas. Without alcohol in the toner, it doesn't overdry. The aloe also doesn't leave a sticky residue. We like that Thayers uses high purity and quality ingredients without unnecessary additives. Thayers is gentle enough to use every day to avert issues and to help heal problems. I like the refeshing cucumber scented toner and my husband, who has very sensitive skin, prefers unscented. I had been using the rose Thayers toner for about a year when I decided I should try the lavender. Although I like the scent of rose better, the lavender has actually cleared up my face and calmed my skin more. So glad I decided to switch. Just use a couple of cotton pads with this after washing your face and just look at how much dirt and makeup that the face washed missed! This is an important step to my face care and I use it everyday! I highly recommend and it smells good too This product is good for sensitive skin. It does not over dry the face. And the scent is very mild which I love. I’m not the kind to be able to handle such strong fragrances. I rarely write reviews but this definitely deserves one!  Wish I have used this for years. Have been using it for like a week so far and my face is 100% smoother. Feels clean (and is!). Wow! Highly recommend!  You won’t be disappointed! I have particularly sensitive and acne prone skin and this toner used after the cerve moisturizing face wash has cleared my skin up more then any other products. I have been making my teenage boys use it and have seen their skin improving as well. Very happy with this product. I love this product. but it is an amazing facial toner, I 've been using Thayers Original Witchazel Facial Toner for the last three days this is an absolute lifesaver. I have sensitive, acne-prone combination skin. My acne has reduced in size and this product isnt drying like other acne products or toners. My skin feels very hydrated after. Amazing! Ive only had it for a couple of days and already see a difference in my skin's texture and redness level use it every night before bed. It helps clear my skin and remove any excess oils and makeup after I cleanse my face. I also have put it in a travel-size container and carry it around with me and if I feel my skin is getting greasy I just put some onto a cotton pad and wipe my face and it leaves me feeling fresh and clean. It does smell like roses when you squeeze it out of the bottle but I haven't noticed my skin smelling like roses and it hasn't made me sneeze or make my eyes water after use."
13,B0009EILKS,"A few months ago I started to notice a series of unsightly tiny black dots on my nose. I had no idea of what they were. After extensive research I discovered they were blackheads and could be eliminated. I purchased the Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips due to the number of positive reviews on Amazon. I will admit I was highly skeptical, but those blackheads had to go. I even resigned myself to the use of as many products as it took to fix the issue. Fortunately I got the right product on the first try.The directions on the box were very easy to follow. Just make sure your nose is wet as on the directions so that the strips will stick. I splashed my nose with water prior to application. The application was seamless. After the set time the strip dried and adhered to my nose as stated on the directions. I removed the strip by peeling both corners towards the middle of my nose at the same time. To be totally honest, taking off the strip was uncomfortable, but once it was off, it was like magic. My nose was completely smooth, free of blackheads, and restored to it's former glory. The discomfort was a distant memory. I would have no problem enduring it time and time again for the results.I observed the used strip and saw all of the grossness that was removed. It was then when I realized just how deep the product penetrated to get everything.I am glad there are are several more in the box just in case they come back. Next time I will be ready.If you have unsightly blackheads on your nose, give  Biore Deep Cleaning Pore Strips a try. You won't regret it. After taking a hot shower to open my pores, I use these strips about once a week or more depending on how many blackheads I see. Ensure your nose is wet because it will not stick to dry skin. Once the strip is harden, peeling off and seeing all the whiteheads sticking on there is oddly satisfying. You have to make sure your noise is completely wet to use these, or it won't stick to your nose. I made the mistake of just having it damp and the strips didn't adhere well. Great product! I thought I had clean skin until I used this the first time. I could not believe the job it did in removing the black heads and white heads. These are good and effective I've tried all the knock offs & forget it! They don't work!!! But BIORE really does especially if u do it like I do!First open one up & remove the back & lay it near the mirror& ur hairdryer!Then wash your nose with hot as u can water until it literally SQUEAKS(U know squeaky clean!)& rinse with hot hot water,DONT DRY! Leave LOTS of water on ur face & run to the mirror & apply the nose strip making sure it is secure & real wet & then use the hair dryer to dry it!Keep watching in the mirror & don't wrinkle ur nose!You'll feel the nose strip tightening, use the dryer until it is completely dry!(it will be stiff,hard to the touch). You can leave it on for couple hours while u do other stuff,once it's dry it will stay put. You'll be shocked when u remove the strip at how much more effectively it works that way! But only BIORE does the job & AMAZON I have found has the very best price. Wish I would have taken a picture. What came off my nose was crazy lol yuck. Feels so smooth after I'm apparently much hairier than I thought. These hurt like a mother. But, I have to say, after the first couple uses I've noticed a definite improvement in my skin. Guess I should've thought of these as ""2-in-1 Waxing and Blackhead Removal."" With that mindset, 4 or 5 stars."
14,B0019LWU2K,"There is nothing like glycerine to moisturize your skin. I use it straight out of the bottle for my nails and cuticles and I add more to my face and body lotions. I have extremely dry skin and this solved my itching and flaking problem! Large bottle and great for diy beauty projects. No scent, but helps emulsify and add moisture to lotions, baby wipes, body sprays etc. Without using it in a snow globe, it is amazing how quickly the glitter leaves the water.Just a little dab in the snow globe and presto change o the glitter now is in slow motion and the blizzard of glitter take’s it’s sweet time leaving the water!I wish it had the same affects in a swimming pool!  I’d have to by it by the gallon to see the slow motion affects! I add it to my serum to turn it into a moisturizer, and to liquid foundation to make it adhere to skin much better and add a dewy look. I have super oilly skin and the foundation usually rubs off midday. but ever since I started adding this glycerine to my skin care especially foundation, my skin is not oily anymore. Maybe because now my skin is always moist enough. And the most pleasant thing I like is that now the foundation looks like natural dewy skin and not cakey anymore. Glycerine is a humectant which means it draws moisture into the skin.  Therefore, applying glycerine before other products like emollients and occlusives will make the other products more effective.  Most products that contain glycerine only have a small amount but there are serums with decent glycerine percentages. If you don’t want to spend a ton on them, try supplementing with pure glycerine.  If you have sensitive skin then maybe dilute it a little with water.Glides on easiest with wet skin or mixed in lotions or Aloe Vera gel.For Dolphin skin:Apply a high glycerine serum or pure glycerine.Follow with an emollient like a rich body butter.Add body oil.Seal it up with Vaseline.Most of the time, I just do glycerine and a nice butter or lotion.  Then add the other steps here and there when I have the time or energy.I use it on my face, too, but only every so often. It can feel a bit sticky if using it pure and can make your skin want to stick to even a silk pillowcase. So just beware.Sometimes, I lather my face and body with glycerine and grape seed oil before a shower.  Then my skin is nice and hydrated but not sticky after I get out and I lose less moisture with hot water.I also add it to my shampoo and conditioner, body wash, and face wash directly at times. I use this product to make my own foaming soap, works great. I add just a drop or 2 to my moisturizer or to just a moist face. My skin reacts well to this in many ways. Lines soften and my skin feels good. It works well for me , it doesn't break the bank,  And...IT'S NOT LOADED WITH CHEMICALS!!! I use this to make natural dryer sheets. Clothes come out extra soft. I have sensitive skin and have no problems."
15,B000QUOD8Y,"This is my favorite sunscreen. The slight lavender fragrance is very pleasant and solicited favorable comments from friends. Love this stuff, works well and I like the smell. It’s February 2023. I just got this lotion and it expires January 2024. Not even a year. I’m gonna look in the pharmacy and see if the expiration dates are better because I feel like the price isn’t justified for it only being good 10 months. I live in Florida so I take sun care seriously. Pretty disappointed We love Alba as a company, and we've used most of their sunscreens at some point. This is the one we turn to right now for our first super thick layer of sunscreen for extended periods of time out in the sun. It rubs in well, doesn't leave the ghosty white time, is moisturizing without being greasy, and it smells really good. I give it 4 stars due to it not being suitable to for the face, and I'd really love to have 1 product.It will go on your face fine, but if you sweat, it can sting your eyes like nobody's business. Therefore I use a certain stick by another company that I probably can't mention here for face, especially my young son's.  We rarely get any level of burn, and if we do it's usually not a product fail but, rather, a user-issue, namely forgetting to reapply in time. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. As for the rest of the day... I will admit that unless it's a windy beach day, we use the Alba Hawaiian spray for frequent-ish spot reapplications throughout the day. It's about the only way I can get my guys--large and small--to pause for a reapplication. That is also an effective product but it will leave you shiny and a little greasy. I'm fine with that for the way we use it, but for pre-dressing and heading to the car, my preference is this lotion for that reason as well. My son uses a nice roll-on product for his camp day reapplications which is easy for him to use without using half the tube, plus it can go on his face. And it won't explode in his backpack. Wish I could mention that one too. But that one is so expensive, I only buy it for the camp scenario, and I slather him in the product on this page plus that face stick every morning. I check Environmental Working Group's site for product toxicity information. They have a specific section on sunscreens. This exact product, as of this writing, rates a ""2"". (Scale is 0-10, lowest is least toxic) The spray version rates a ""3"". Do good to use on your face. My vision got blurry it stings  around the eyes.  Works great for the body. Easy to spread I love this sunscreen and I’ve been using it for years! I have used multiple spf strengths and they all work well and longer than 80 minutes in the water. I have noticed friends using different name brands of sunscreen with the same or higher spf while we are out on the lake. After a day of fun in the sun I notice they are a little sun burnt and I am not. This sunscreen is not greasy and a little goes a long way! My skin is very Sensitive and I have had no issues whatsoever. I use this on children too. This is now the only sunscreen I use! This is my favorite sunscreen because it’s very light in SPF scent. I am fair skinned and hardly ever wear sunscreen because I don’t like the smell. This is very light weight (not very oily) and has a pleasant, light smell. I used to buy it in store, but glad I can get it here!"
16,B000U52T9K,"I’ve been using this product for years Even though this tiny cream jar has a simple and clean packaging, it still caught my attention based on the amount of high and positive reviews. As a licensed esthetician, I was curious to find out why thats is, and hence, took a closer look at the ingredients list. I was pleasantly surprised about my findings and would like to share some of the information in this review hoping that my humble opinion helps you make a better, more informed decision.1. One of the ingredients is APRICOT OIL, which is similar to almond oil, contains minerals such as CALCIUM and MAGNESIUM; MONO/POLY unsaturated fats; and the best vitamins for skin such as VITAMIN A (moisturizes, increases elasticity, strengthens the structure of the skin, reduces fine lines); VITAMIN C (an antioxidant, promotes elasticity, gives your skin even and healthy skin tone); VITAMIN F (normalizes sebum production and aids skin regeneration). The oil is beneficial for ALL SKIN TYPES (it calms sensitive skin, heals inflammation in problem skin, and softens dry/tight skin).2. SQUALENE - this component is pricey because it is stored and obtained from shark's liver, the richest natural source of squalene. Squalene is widely distributed throughout the body but the majority is transported to the skin. Sebum has high levels, up to 12%, and that explains why squalene plays an important role in protecting our skin from aging by giving it elasticity, moisture and soft velvety feel. After age 25, the amount of squalene begins to decrease! Consequently, to maintain our youth and beauty, we turn to look for alternative sources of this oil!3. Punica granatum (or POMEGRANATE) juice - helps to hold moisture in the cells, thus preventing wrinkles while maintaining the pH balance in the epidermis (making it especially great for DRY skin).4. CARROT SEED OIL - one of the best anti-aging products as it activates regeneration processes, evens out and gives your skin a healthy glow (good for HYPERPIGMENTATION and stretch marks), an antioxidant with detoxifying properties.After all the above mentioned, yes, this product might not have the most eye catching packaging, but when you dive deeper, you realize that this cream is in no way inferior to even luxury skincare brands that, by the way, include all the advertising and marketing costs into the final product price:) I liked the ease of use and the quick results of this product.  All of that at a fair price! I love that it has no perfumes or chemicals. It's unscented it moisturizes and firms your face and leaves it feeling light and clean. I can not be without this product Originally bought this for some slightly sagging skin I had on my arms but ended up using it on my tummy and face after I have birth. This stuff works! It did wonders for my face. I was having issues with my upper eye lid starting to sag and fold. It got to the point where when I would apply eyeshadow, it would leave a hideous separation mark ruining my makeup. I saw this in an Avon store and tried a sample and I loved how it feels. It's lightweight, non greasy and absorbs quickly. The store did not have any so, I turned to Amazon. It was waaaay cheaper on here so I was definitely going to try it. It fixed my problem in a matter of two weeks. I used this every morning after washing my face and again at night also after washing my face because it makes a great moisturizer as well. I started seeing results in a matter of days, but the full result only took a few weeks. I was extremely happy. It worked good on my postpartum baby belly. I applied this everyday after a shower and used a tummy shaper to help keep things in place and it worked great for that as well. This cream is underrated I think..... First I was superised to see it is actually a very small jar.. but you don't need much each time. So it's still very good bang for your buck. The texture is great! Non-greasy, fast absorbing, and it's of very light weight. Makes your skin feel good.It says ""dramatic firming""... and it is a truthful statement! This is the first time EVER, I felt a cream actually firmed my face!!!! I have very good genes (thank God), and my skin is super soft, fine and smooth, and I don't have aging signs. But, don't they always tell us that we should start our skin care procedure when we are young? So I thought firming and tightening are necessary. But because my skin is already tight and firm, it's hard to tell if a firming cream works or not... but to my surprise, this Avon Solutions firming cream unbelievably made my skin actually look even firmer!!! Happy with the purchase. This is hands down the best firming cream that I have been able to find.  It's affordable and ships quickly; mine shipped only 12 hours after placing the order.  I'm 34 and have started to see the effects of sun and age on my neck and chest.  Immediately upon applying the cream, I can see and feel a difference.  The little lines and wrinkles that have started to creep around are greatly reduced and barely noticeable after one application.I tried it out on my grandma to see if the effects were ""the same"" (she's 81).  Well, she took the jar and said that I have to order another. Needless to say, I have another jar on the way! :-)As long as I keep getting these great results, this is going to be my number one go-to firming product! I used the whole jar....not worth the money."
17,B000NRQ89M,"Comparing it to the Nivea brand you can tell it will absorb into your skin because your body will feel the same as if you put lotion on right after getting out of the shower. I don't really like the feeling you get after applying lotion so that's why I rated it the 4 stars but I decided to give it a try anyway and my body is still moisturized the day after. I bought two of these, one for my husband and one for me. We're both delighted with the effectiveness of the lotion and the pleasant scent.It's also wonderful not to feel slimy or sticky the way some regular lotions can make the skin feel, even after they're supposed to have ""soaked in."" This in-shower lotion makes the skin feel hydrated and soft, with none of the residue that makes dressing after showering such a hassle; clothes don't cling awkwardly to the skin, which makes layering in winter so much easier. It will be great in summer, too, not to feel slick or greasy.I do still have to put additional lotions/creams on my hands, elbows, knees, and feet. However, I did not expect this in-shower lotion to work on really dry areas like those.It also works remarkably well on my face. I was expecting a breakout as the result of trying it, but it didn't happen. (Your experience may vary!) My face also seems to stay hydrated longer after using it, which I did not expect but was delighted to discover. The product is great, however, i can get the bigger bottle for the same price in the store.  If i would've paid attention to the size i wouldn't have ordered it.  Other than that, i love the feel how it makes my skin feel and smell. I have very dry skin and this has been a lifesaver for days when I'm running late. Overall I still prefer using body oil. I like the ritual of it and the scent of the 2 I use better (although the scent of this one is lovely - like a crisper version of cocoa butter). Also the oils I use makes my skin look more supple. But in terms of actually locking in moisture, this works just as well and it saves so much time. A) it spreads on easily in the shower and b) unlike oils or lotions you don't have to wait for it to try/absorb before putting on your close. This is particular useful in the winter when less skin is exposed and it takes more time to get ready in the morning. I will not ever go without this. I cannot find this at the local pharmacy. The product works, it really does a good job. It is rather confusing to think that you can apply lotion and then rinse it off.  However, not only is your skin soft and smooth at that time but it seems to have a cumulative effect so that your skin stays smooth and moisturized the whole time. It does not come off with your sweat and yet, you do not feel greasy.I have been using it for years, my coworker would buy it for me from the military exchange but then I see Amazon has it, what does Amazon not carry. I joke that if you want a new husband/wife/boy-girlfriend/in-laws, I bet you Amazon can sell you one!!Anyway, GREAT PRODUCT, prompt delivery, excellent! If you are sensitive to scents, do not purchase this. I wanted to have a moisturizer I could put on in the shower and rinse off. I did not know they existed. I figured I would check Amazon. I obviously found some and I was so excited to try it when it arrived. So so so disappointed. I have used this scent of body wash and liked it so I thought I would like the lotion. Nope. It has such a stronger scent. I can smell it on myself hours later. I have never smelled such a potent lotion. It is nauseating. I can taste it. I have learned for future reference to physically go to a store to smell items before I use them for the first time. We have a fragrance sensitivity policy at work and if I have to shower again before I go to work, I will not be happy. Happy with the return policy. I wish I would of known about this Olay Moisture in shower body lotion years ago. I do not like applying lotion so my skin has been really dry. I used for a week and already see a difference. Then when I get back into the shower you can still tell the lotion is still working because the water is beading off my skin!!!!!! I LOVE this stuff and can only find in online!  I can never find it in stores anymore.  If you have dry skin this is the lotion for you!  Rub it on in the shower after your body wash/soap and then rinse off.  My skin will stay moist all day after using this lotion and I only have to use a little bit at a time so I can usually make one bottle last far past winter.  When I order it I usually buy several bottles at a time as I'm afraid I'll never be able to find it again."
18,B00005NAOD,"I was so scared to try this!!! I have VERY sensitive skin. I love this lotion for my body but when I saw they make a face lotion ???.... So I went ahead and tried it. I am 48 years old fair as Casper and if I even get hand lotion on my face ... I break out. Not sure when the teen age sensitivity and pimples will go away lol the only thing I avoid is the eyes. It cause my eyes to run a bit like when sunscreen is applied. I only wear at night. I haven't tried under makeup. For context I have VERY dry skin, I live in the desert. Rango I am Rango .. so to my surprise only minor break outs and they healed in a day. Nothing painful. Could have been anything really. After a week or so I have noticed a difference in texture and plumpness of my skin. I am not sure Id wear under makeup haven't braved that yet. It's not greasy and absorbs on my skin quickly. Hope this helps!UpdateI am really loving this lotion! It's been over a month. Skin texture has definitely improved. It's too heavy for me to wear under foundation. I do apply just the smallest tiniest droplet of water size under my eyes before foundation. It is truly a really great lotion. Long lasting moisturizing. I use it at night and in the morning. For day, I use a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen after the Eucerin Q10 anti-wrinkle soaks in for a few minutes. My dry skin is dry no more. Doesn’t feel greasy at all. No scent. I have sensitive skin and love this face cream. The price is reasonable, which is a rare find! Only $11 for this little pot of luxury. Nourishing, immediately improves the perkiness and brightness of skin. Halfway through the jar and my skin certaibly looks 1 year younger, if not more. Will continue to buy and 10/10 recommend. Do not overlook this item! It’s amazing on the face, especially for sensitive skin!! I'm still on the search for an anti-wrinkle face cream that doesn't make me break out.  This one is actually better others I've tried, but not perfect.  At this price point, I'd say it's worth a shot if you have sensitive skin. Your mileage may vary, of course. This cream is one of the better values available for your money.  I used to by expensive department store creams but stopped doing so when drugstore products got expensive too.  I realize it is such a scam.  This product has very little scent, it is very moisturizing but not greasy.  It arrived safety sealed unlike others I have purchased on Amazon. I have been using this product for several years. It is great for dry skin without being greasy. Great for dry skin"
19,B000I5KCIW,"Pros: - Fragrance free - less chance of skin irritation - Has zinc oxide - good for both UVA and UVB protection. - Less expensive than other sunscreens with zinc oxide - Moisturizing - Seems to stay on well even with a little sweating - Bottle is cute  - it is fun how the bottle turns blue in UV lightCons: - If you’re vegan, this does have beeswax.  As of August 2018, The FAQ section on the Blue Lizard site claims their sunscreens contain no animal-derived products. Although some people might consider beeswax not animal-derived because it’s not literally made of dead bees, I still think that claim on their site is a bit misleading. -  Can give a bit of a white cast. If you really rub it in, the cast isn’t that noticeable at all. However, I have pale skin. Not sure this sunscreen would work that well for dark skin tones…- Technically NOT water-resistant ( though NO sunscreen is completely waterproof as far as I know) . If you are gonna be outside basically all day, doing active outdoorsy things, or being in the water, you’d probably want to get another sunscreen just to be on the safe side. However, it does seem to stay on well with some sweating anyways so if you’re not going to be sweating too much or around water that much, this should work fine.- No added fragrance, but there is a slight sunscreen-y smell. Not a bad smell necessarily, but not super pleasant either.It was what I expected it to be when I ordered this so I would recommend this.  Just make sure you read the cons I listed above because it’s not for everyone or for all situations. I have rosacea on my face.  I've tried some other products for this condition (there's nothing really made that cures this problem) without any positive results.The #1 trigger for rosacea is sunlight.  I realized that the left side of my face had more of a problem than the right side.  Then it occurred to me that the left side of my face gets more sunlight exposure when driving than the right side does.  Maybe if I could mitigate the effects of sunlight, it might mitigate my rosacea problem.This sunscreen was recommended by others and it makes sense that during a normal day my face gets a lot of sunlight.  I don't have to be out by the pool or at the beach to get a lot of sun on my face.  So the idea that a daily application of a sunscreen with all natural ingredients to protect my face from this major rosacea trigger made sense to me and I bought a bottle.  Again, I don't consider this a cure, but a preventative application.It's now been one week since I began a daily morning application of the product.  My rosacea has been noticeably diminished.  I think I've found a solution to my problem.I use the product sparingly.  It's a thick white liquid.  And I work that into my skin.  Initially, it leaves my skin a little white-ish and shiny, but that quickly fades and a natural looks remains.I believe what I'm finding is that rosacea is fading due to the fact that I'm protecting my skin from the continual damage caused by sun exposure.  (Oh, my office gets full sun every afternoon and the left side of my face faces the windows.)I will update this post after more time has past, but in just one week, I'm already feeling very good about Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen SPF 30+, 5-ounce.I hope this information will help others like me. This stuff feels so cooling and nice on my skin. Never have breakouts. No titanium dioxide thank goodness, that ingredient makes me break out and im sure im not the only one. Shouldn't be in sensitive sunscreen. And it sucks that octinoxate is bad for the environment because it just works so well and never causes issues for my hyper sensitive skin. So this is perfect for me. Does leave a white cast that mostly fades, but I have to put foundation on after so I don't look so pale. Wish they'd come out with tinted!!!! That'd be so incredible. I'm obsessed with this stuff, keep coming back to it. Also like andalou naturals sensitive tinted, but this feels nicer on my skin. I've used four varieties of Blue Lizard -- Baby, Sensitive, Face, and Sport -- and I've posted the same review for each one. Baby and Sensitive are virtually identical. Face feels more dry, and doesn't leave your skin shiny. Sport seems to go on a little easier, but also has more potentially irritating chemicals than Sensitive or Baby (or so I'm told).Here is the bottom line: Each version of Blue Lizard that I have tried will last through a 4+ hours of golf in direct midday sun, even when I'm perspiring heavily, and I'll go home with NO redness or burning whatsoever. (FYI, I am very light skinned and do develop a tan, but burn VERY easily, in 15 min. or less. I also perspire a lot, especially in the heat and humidity around the Washington D.C. metro area, where we live.) A little goes a long way, and if you take a few minutes to work it in, it stays put pretty well and doesn't run into your eyes.It isn't the easiest to put on, and it takes some soap and water to get it off, but until they change the formula is some significant way, Blue Lizard is head and shoulders above all the other major-brand sunscreens that I've tried -- and I've tried a lot. It's also nice that the Baby and Sensitive versions get high marks for their lack of toxic chemicals, and we've used them on babies and toddlers with sensitive skin, and never had any problems, either with burning or reaction to the sunscreen. Strongly recommended."
20,B0018P2ZEA,"I rely heavily on reviews and I'm not the only one. Most ppl on the web rely solemnly on reviews. I wish more of us wrote more in depth reviews they are beyond reliable and useful and just overall necessary. So now for my drawn out product review. This is probably the best chemical peel ever! However, you must repeat it every few weeks or every month or two. It still is not magic and won't take everything away immediately. If you have hyperpigmentation buy a simple fade cream palmers or nadinola work great. Nothing happens over night. Chemical peels are just deep exfoliates not overnight dark spot correctors so keep that in mind when you consider anything for your skin. Pure glycolic acid at a low percentage can be good as a daily toner but that also stings. NOTHING WORKS IMMEDIATELY!Clean your skin and use a fade cream. It's like MAGIC! Waxing or shaving is also good. I shave everything back, arms and all. Shaving is my great exfoliator. I use my husbands Gillette powerball razors because waxing irritates my skin, and I use a big scrub brush from a discount store. Now instead of my Venus we just buy extra razor heads and I use his.Now back to Jessners. It takes about a week to complete. It comes with a gauze pad in my opinion not worth using. So if you see a fan brush floating on your screen in relevance to purchasing this product please buy it. A brush is much better to use a thin one with good bristles. Make sure it soaks up the acid in it without dripping because if it drips you'll be mad. It should never drip so dab the brush so you know it applies just enough. You may or may not use the entire bottle so you could always pour a little in an extra glass and use the brush that way. Using the brush and the bottle it comes with was just annoying to me. And putting a little in a separate glass bowl helped to save me whatever was left over. If you use a cotton pad or cotton ball you will use the entire bottle for no reason. If you want to do your back a cotton pad is best but like I said a brush is better so if you can get someone to apply it for you that's much better. My face I did by myself I burnt my back the 1st time so the second time I had my husband do it for me.Once you put it on after about 30secs to 1min. it'll burn like hell then it'll whiten a little (what they refer to as frosting) which on my face and back it pretty much looked like smeared powder or just ashy skin. If it burns you can use a fan or try to tolerate it as long as you can. If you see little blisters or white tiny pimples or bumps anywhere that just means it's working and bringing up any toxins that lay underneath your skin. I was freaked out at first but I noticed I had it only in spots that I frequently had extra acne or stubborn hair. Like these four tiny hairs that grow on my chest. Nasty I know however, I picked at them the first time which caused scarring but by the third time I used it it didn't happen and I'm glad the scarring finally disappeared. I never used a neutralizer although I've heard that is best. Because my skin is sensitive once I put it on I literally let cold water pour on me for like five to ten minutes. This also helped to keep the burning sensation down as long as the water is running softly not hard, hard will also burn.Within the next two days my skin tightened up and looked shiny. Do not rub it on your skin or scratch as that will burn and leave even more scarring. I had two burn marks the first time from rubbing my skin with a wet cold wash cloth which is why I began to just let the water run on it especially my back. Do not use a wash cloth at all. If it burns too much wash it off immediately as that is a sign your skin is too sensitive. If it turns red while frosting or applying--immediately wash off and keep washing until you feel no more burning. Read the instructions and do not use soap afterwards. For me using soap after letting the water rinse it off has irritated my skin every time so you might want to cleanse first and don't cleanse again until the next day. Do a skin test! I didn't and most people don't I never do and yes I still don't but I only use what I know now will work. Please beware you want to fix your skin not damage it more and everything is not for everyone. However, the longer it stays on the more effective and better it works. You won't take it lightly but you might get use to it after a while. The first few times I used acne free severe acne as a cleanser and alcohol as a toner.After the first couple days it will begin to peel, when it does it looks as if you've been burned 3 degrees deep and it's starting to heal. Do not pick at it or pull it this too will cause scarring. I use my own soap and moisturizer as I have ""fix it skin"" and the first time I used it jessners moisturizer broke me out. Yet, when I only use the acid, dove shower wash for sensitive skin and palmers or nadinola my skin cleared up completely. Whatever I do to my face I do to my entire body. YES MY ENTIRE BODY! (Except for my genitals hand palms and soles of my feet other than that nothing is off limits).Also, keep in mind consistency is key...exfoliate or scrub your skin well and use a fade cream 2xs daily you'll see results in 1-2 weeks or less. I am a black light skinned women 30yrs old with 3 kids. My kids made my skin worst. Now I'm finally the best I've ever been, even post-children. You live and you learn. I've been waxing since 2001 and using peels since 06'. I stopped both in 2015 and haven't had a problem since. With 3 little ones I don't have time for peels, their after effects or the downtime in order to ensure they work properly. I scrub my skin (exfoliate), and use a fade cream. However, if you want a peel this one is the best. Trust me I've had hundreds. You really don't need to buy the kit just using the acid became good for me. The kit comes with a sample microdermabrasion scrub which is also great, but also can be brought separate. The other stuff is not for me. Keep in mind also when you use a fade cream don't rub it everywhere as my skin started out as like two-toned patches when I first began fading. Focus more on the darker areas it's the best way to see fast results and I don't have to burn my skin for it to work.Cellulite or other skin firmers also work well on stretch marks along with fade creams but always do your homework first. Again I have 3 kids and thought my body was done! However, I found what works the best and at 30 I have 10year old skin. My skin is so well I might end up with a 4th kid by 31. Black ppl never think we need sunscreen. Use a sunscreen everyone. Sunscreen helps to keep your skin even toned at its original skin complexion before/after and during sun exposure. My children are mixed and like their mother they all 3 too have eczema and fix it skin my oldest is caramel a little darker than me and my two youngest are damn near white and we all have the same skin and hair. Whatever I do to my skin I do to theirs. But I would never put acid on my children EVER! So why put it on me therefore last year I stopped after my nena was born and my skin has been softer and clearer than it's ever been. Tans damage your skin I don't care what your ethnic background is and quite frankly to be honest neither does acid which can also damage your skin.Read reviews and research every product you take an interest in before using it. Don't just go with what worked for someone else or what you feel may work best. And let's be real not everyone will let you in on their little secrets whether friends or family as if it's top secret or something lol. Don't be discouraged and if something doesn't work once it's ok. It's 2016 ask and you shall receive. Anywho, Take care of YOU inside and out. A healthy diet, exercise and proper skin care regimens with patience and persistence you will be soooohappy. I love pizza but it produces acne I'm good! After my second son I developed tummy issues as well so I definitely took an interest in eating better. LOL! I finally found what works for me. And everything I use I got from a hair supply store down the block. I hope if you took the time to read all I wrote that you too will find happiness through what works for you. Good luck to all and I hope you have better years with better skin days. If only I knew then what I know now. Queen Helene masque of mask has also been my fav I use it on the weekends or sometimes with my evening shower. '' i did my facial peel on Monday, today is Saturday, so it has been 5 days...This was my first time to ever do a peel, thought i was prepared but wow, i can say i was not...okay so i followed direction that was sent with product, and I,start applying to my forehead and working towards cheek bones to chin, applying with fan brush, brushing towards my hair line...Took just a few seconds to apply to whole face......and then let me tell you, the fun began....OH my Oh my....That stuff left like a 1000 or more fire ants just stinging the hell out of my face.. i could not find my fan, so all i had was a piece of paper trying to fan myself, OMG, i was  dancing around, walking fast just trying to get some kind of breeze to hit my face...I know that I only had my peel on my face maybe a whole minute, and that's it, When i looked into mirror all around my mouth,chin,around my noise, forehead was frosted over, the only part of my face that did not frost was my cheeks/ear area, and up around corner of my eyes...I was really un sure as what to do, if i should leave longer, but didn't want to burn or damage my skin, so i started rinsing of with baking soda and water....My face was really sore, felt burnt, hot and so red....got a cold wet rag and  laid it across my face and went laid on my bed with a/c vents directed at my face...Okay that was Monday, I put lots of moisturizer on my face before i went to bed, I woke up Tuesday morning with my face peeling big pieces/flakes of skin, looked really gross..and the area around my noise,mouth and down the side to my chin, has peeled 3 times and is still peeling,..Lots of dead skin, layers of it...The other part of my face that frosted has all peeled and is healing, do not have any more pain/stinging feeling nor do i have a hot red face...I can say that my worst days was Tues,Wed,& Thursday, I looked terrible and I walked around with wet rag on my face....Will I do this again, YES, but i will defiantly have my fan plugged in on high...and i will also apply around my face and neck first, wait a few seconds, before applying  around mouth, noise chin area,Would I recommend this Chemical peel, Yes most defiantly, with all the stinging,redness,and peeling skin, well worth it, my skin looks and feels so soft, any blackheads i had are gone, i also had some dark spots, and what was able to frost over and peel off are gone as well, As soon as my face is completely healed, I'm going to do again..."
21,B0009RFB76,"I've been using this RoC Rentinol Correxion Eye Cream for about a month now. I apply once a day, only at night. I did have some slight burning initially but that subsided. It didn't cause any redness or other sensitivities. After continual use, my eyes have started to look less puffy and the skin underneath is smoother. Yes, there are still some fine lines, nothing will get rid of them outside of plastic surgery (no thanks), but I can still see the difference. My husband even said my eyes seem brighter. You only need a little dab so even though this tube is tiny, it will last quite a while. I intend to keep it as part of my nightly regimen. I purchased this and then read a lot of bad reviews. I tried stopping the delivery but they wouldn’t. I’ve tried the same product I bought at Walmart. This One I bought from Amazon is exactly the same. I didn’t see anything wrong with the product. The consistency is the same as the other I bought at Walmart. It works well under my eyes. Puffiness, circles are diminishing, and it’s hydrating. Considering it’s only $20, I expected less, but it really does a good job under the eyes as said. This is not anything remotely close to the bad reviews. I really like it. It’s from the maker, it’s not been replaced by some other cheap version, it’s a great product! It is what it says!I would disregard the bad reviews. It’s genuine!! I have to say I noticed improvement to my dark circles overnight. The only thing is my eyes are very sensitive to it & watered for about an hour. I will try using a smaller portion tonight. This is the first product that seemed to work for me. I’ve gone all day without make up or eye concealer. I usually look like a raccoon. It’s embarrassing. I do recommend this product. I only gave 4 stars due to packaging. It’s a little scary using something that wasn’t sealed on arrival. 🌸🤍 This product has worked so far! I’ve used it for almost 10 days. I’m seeing subtle improvements and I’m sure I’ll see more as I keep using it.I’m 31 and painfully white, basically albino. I’m also hilarious and constantly laughing at my own jokes so I have some noticeable crows feet and I’m a mom of 2 so the dark circles have appeared.I’ve tried a lot of products and they’ve all been pretty good but this is the first one I’ve used where I see results! I’m super happy with this product and would recommend. This is the authentic product, but I suspect it was stolen. Box had an oddly placed sticker. I removed it to find a price tag hidden under it. Regardless, product performs as promised. I bought this because it was highly recommended in several articles for its ingredients. I don’t know that it works GREAT, but it does moisturize a bit.I think the texture makes me doubt its powers, lol, because it is a very light and thin lotion. Right or wrong, I always feel a thicker cream patted on is working harder. 🤣  I do feel more moisturized by other products — but they don’t have the super-power ingredients this one has.I will use this up, but then look for a thicker cream with superpowers. 🙂 However, I’m sure some people might prefer a lighter lotion like this. So it does what it says!Really removes the bags and slightly the dark undertone under the eyes.If you want to get rid of puffy eyes you should use it.A little goes a long way, I have it more then 2 months now and I'm on half of the tube.I apply it morning and night This stuff definitely works. Definitely made the  wrinkles & redness on my eyes reduce by a lot. Use it every other night. I didn’t use it on my face though, but I’m 100% sure it would work amazing on face wrinkles! On my face I used the Cerave retinol resurfacing serum and it reduced all my redness & brightened my skin :) both are a forever staple in my skin care routine.EDIT: I meant to put 2023 not 2022 😂"
22,B0012ILUC6,"I definitely feel this has improved my skin tone and lightened some dark spots! I mix a scoopful (comes with tiny scooper) with facial moisturizer and rub into my face. It immediately tightens so I know my skin is reacting to the ingredients. It's a good feeling! Will re-buy. Absorbent Some years ago I studied and tried to understand about skin care products and what was hype and what was worthwhile.This product is not appreciated enough.  IMHO it is the most available-usable-to-skin Vit. C that one can get.  It seemed to me that nothing else I used that was Vit. C had the same effect on my skinIt is a dry powder that comes with a little teeny plastic spoon.  Just add it to something, moisturizer with sunscreen, tinted moisturizer, you can try different things. Blend it in your palm and try to make it all mix.If you couldn't mix it really well, and you see some teeny little white clumps of it, just brush them off with your hand.I was wondering after not using it for a long time how long it would be to show effects...  That DAY I had people complimenting me on my skin, without my telling them about this at all.  That's fun!For the reviewer who didn't like it much and used it at night?  Just wanted to say, again IMHO!, that I think you should try it  during the day, not at night;  it seems that a little bit of sunshine helps the product really work; still wear sunscreen, you don't need to sit outside or change your routine, just a bit of sun will help a lot.The bottle may look small, but it takes a long, long time to use it up.It seems like products are going by the wayside; I would like it if this product never gets discontinued!Thank you to all of you reviewers for all the great advice and time you have spent sharing so that we don't waste as much money as we probably would without you! Like many women my age, I used tanning beds with an abandon in my teens and even 20s.  All of that UV damage has now surfaced to my skin and this year I had horrible sun spots all over my cheekbones.  No matter how much makeup I applied I couldn't get them to fade.  This powder has made such an improvement in only a few weeks!Following the advice of some other reviewers, I started with half a scoop of powder in the palm of my hand, then added 5 drops of a hyaluronic acid serum, mixed them together really well, then applied all over my face.  I let that dry completely, putting on my eye cream and deodorant, and then coming back to apply moisturizer.  Within a couple of days my skin was brighter - kind of like the glow I had when I was pregnant! And best of all, now a few weeks in, the sun spots have really started to fade.  I can completely cover them with makeup now.  It also worked to reduce some of the old acne scars I had from years back.I wish I knew a long time ago how well this stuff worked!  I will be a customer for life! This works great with the hope serum it makes it smoother to put on. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing because of the price and the weight of the product.  But I use vitamin C in my chemical lab for transport of amino acids and know just how potent of an antioxidant it is based of it's transport mechanism.  I have had the unfortunate event of running into a lot of really crappy serums and moisturizers that have a lot of fragrance and oxidize before you're even halfway done with the product or have broken me out the next morning! I have been combining half a scoop of the turbo booster with my Peter Thomas Roth Camu Camu C moisturizer and have noticed a world of a difference in my acne scarring.  My skin is smoother,  not as oily and the treatment works well with the mild AHA and BHA acids I have in my skin care routine.  I know the bottle will last quite a bit of time,  and if kept tightly closed and in a dark,  cool space,  I don't have to worry about it breaking down and reducing in potency too soon.  I am pleased with this vitamin c purchase for once in a very long and annoying history of purchases. It's not inexpensive but you do get great results. I use other phlosiphy products.I put a soup in night cream and a soup in my day cream .it's portant you apply to clean skin. I have major dark spots that lightened up quite a bit.  Yes it made a big difference. I’ve been using this for years. It works"
23,B001GIOV82,"I often have dry, flaky skin around my eyes, especially in winter time. In addition to not looking the greatest and itching throughout the day, I was getting concerned about how this might affect my long term skin health. After trying several big cosmetic brands from the drugstore, all of which irritated my eyes during the day and didn't fully relieve the dryness, I gave up for a while.Now I am in the process of transitioning from big name chemically based body care products to more natural choices, and revisited my eye problem. It turns out that the ""brighteners"" or ""light reflectors"" included in many cosmetics and eye creams can cause irritation. I sought out a simply moisturizing cream with natural ingredients and ordered Burt's Bees Naturally Ageless. Most of its ingredients are rated a ""0"" concern by EWG, and I'm fine with a little alcohol as long as the rest of the goo keeps it from creating dryness.I've been applying a tiny dab after my shower every morning and notice that my eye skin is no longer dry, and feels fresh throughout the day. A little goes a long way, and I expect the half ounce jar to last at least 6 months. I gave it 5 stars because I'm not sure how long it will last and how the results will fare in the longer term.A couple things to note - while the box is clearly labeled the container inside has no labels whatsoever - just some white cream in a glass jar. This may lead to some confusion in a house with multiple cosmetic users, or in a well-stocked cabinet, but works fine for me and hasn't triggered any questions from my husband. Also, the cream itself is quite thick and I have taken to storing the jar on its side to make it easy to dab a little onto a finger without scooping into the jar. I do love this eye cream. I carry it with me in my make-up bag. I really feel as though it helps moisturize the eye area gently.That being said, I did read other reviews on the scent. I was putting this on one night (in the car) and my fiancé looks at me and says ""Someone smells like the perfume department at Macy's"". Thought slightly mortified, I have to admit, there is a scent to it. It's not as heavy as my fiancé may have indicated, but there is a scent. You will smell it. I think it smells a little odd (weird and flowery, i.e. I would not wear this as a perfume) but I don't find the scent strong enough at all. My fiancé is very scent sensitive though. If you're sensitive to scent, you'll probably be sensitive to this, and therefore, you may not like it.If you can get over the scent, this is your best friend. This works wonders for someone like me (I can't speak for anyone else). I'm a young 20-something with pretty good skin but wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes from being in college, working and just plain not sleeping enough. It's definitely lightweight and seems to absorb quickly. I would highly recommmend this for those who are not sensitive to scents. I can't wear this in the day because my eye-makeup is constantly at odds with this thick, waxy cream. However, it's a great night cream for me. It lasts through all the tossing and turning, and I can still see it shining in the morning. (That's right, it's a bit shiny... another reason why it's not exactly an ideal day cream).The only reasons I may not buy it again, however, are these:1. It's grainy in addition to being waxy, so you have to spread it around pretty vigorously for it to soak into your skin. Not ideal for delicate skin around the eyes.2. The tub it comes in is hard to finish off because of the shape. It's easy enough to reach your finger under the lip into that little bulbous area, but I almost always come out of it with eye cream jammed under my finger nails. I hesitate to rate this cream too badly because I only purchased it to help with dark circles. I am in my 20's, so I don't have too many wrinkles that need diminishing yet. But I have always had dark circles under my eyes. I purchased this cream to see if it would help at all (as it claims to). However, I have been using it for about a month now and have not seen any improvements.So perhaps it works for wrinkles, I can't vouch for that. When I put it on, it does seem to tighten the skin. But for dark circles/puffiness, it does not work for me.The smell seems to be an issue for some people. I agree that it smells somewhat medicinal, but it is not flowery or overly strong. I have had very dark circles under my eyes as long as I can remember.  I have tried many products to improve or cover them, from inexpensive to pricey, usually with disappointing results.  Until Burt's Ageless eye cream!  I had read that some people had improvement in dark circles when using this cream, so I thought I would give it a try, even though I wasn't expecting much.  I used it morning and night, and started seeing results within a week!  People at work kept commenting on how healthy and ""beautiful"" I looked, and I started to realize that it was the Burt's that was improving my appearance!  I have very sensitive skin and often have allergic reactions to products, but I haven't had a problem in the four months I've been using this cream.  The skin around my eyes feels very moisturized all day too.  I recently tried Burt's Radiance eye cream at night since it is a little richer and makes a good night cream.  If I use the Ageless under  my makeup for daytime, and the Radiance at night, I am maintaining the same great results.  No more concealer for me! The cap was brokem when it arrived. shipping was fast .  The bottle was different than those purchased in the store and on Burt Bees website.  The name is also different . I hope the product is the same.  Considering I am not certain, I will probably discontinue using it and purchase it on Burt bees website.Would Have given it 5 stars ---- but I don't know if it is the truly the same product for the reasons mentioned above.Otherwise, I loved the product when purchased at the store and had to have it again.  Results were Fabulous.  Then, I don't have wrinkles  probably because and once of prevention goes a long way. 40's must be the new twenties because I am 'carded' all the time."
24,B000QURQQU,"I really watch what I put on my children’s skin and this is the only face lotion I’ve been using since my first baby was born. I even use it myself from time to time and it’s really been great for my skin as well (I’m in my early 30’s) and helps keep my skin elastic.My child has extremely sensitive skin, so Weleda products are our go-to and are even significantly better than anything our dermatologist recommended! My two year old came home with what seemed like a paci rash on her face. I was recommended this stuff to buy and it made a visible difference the first night &cleared up completely in 2 days. I bought it initially for my baby but use it myself a lot. I love the feel on my skin and the scent. Cream seems to soften & soothe hands & wrists. I purchased this for myself, not my baby. I'd been having allergic reactions, with rashy dry patches, to my face cream. My dermatologist recommended that I use Aquaphor as a moisturizer. Uh, no thanks on the petroleum face. I use the Weleda calendula oil on my baby for massages, and was really happy with the quality of Weleda products. I was also looking to add calendula to my routine to try to heal the rashy patches. I figured I would give this cream a try.The cream comes in a metal tube - not my favorite, but not a deal breaker. The texture is creamy and emollient, and it does take awhile to really soak in. Since I use primarily it as a night cream, this isn't problematic. It doesn't end up smeared on my pillow, though it does feel a little thick, deceptively so, because it comes out of the tube with a light, fluffy texture.The smell is right for a calendula product: woody and a little herbal. I'm not a huge fan of the smell of calendula in general, but it's natural and isn't being masked by a perfume. It performs as calendula should. After applying it on the first night, I woke up with an immense improvement in the redness of my rash, and the texture was also normalizing. After a few weeks, the rash was gone, and my skin was supple and much softer.I will use this as a day cream only when I am reasonably sure I will be staying in all or most of the day. It is thick enough that I would not want to put makeup on top, and I don't believe it contains sunscreen. This doesn't deter me from touting this cream as awesome in a tube as a healing night cream. Since no one product can do all things, I am happy when I find a product that does what I need it to do, and so it well. The product is natural, and it works beautifully for me. This cream has saved my life many a times! 5 years ago on a cruise, I broke out from Dior Foundation (yup, paid $50 to get a red face full of rashes).  My face was swollen, as if a jellyfish had stung it.  It was horrible.  Luckily, I was due home the next day.  I decided that this cream could not hurt so I applied it at night before going to bed, but not expecting too much.  I woke up and wow, my face was back to normal! The redness was completely gone, and the breakouts had shrunken significantly.  I used it again last year when I got sunburned and my face was on fire.  The next morning, my face was more of a bronze shade with the redness subsiding and I was able to sleep, whereas before, the pillow on my face or any fabric touching my face was painful.  Calendula came to the rescue again yesterday, when I received an acid burn from AmLactin, a supposedly ""moisturizing"" cream that had been prescribed for Keratosis Pilaris.  That stuff is dangerous, unbeknownst to me.  The skin in my inner arm in the elbow area was raw, as if I had rosacea, and it was painful, as well as unsightly.  After applying this cream, my skin no longer feels irritated and the redness has faded significantly.  I am posting a picture of my skin last night before using Calendula, and this morning, after using the Calendula overnight, so you can see the difference yourself.  This cream is truly miraculous.  Google it yourself, and you'll see all the health benefits from using Calendula.  It is anti-inflammatory, a wound healer, relieves sores and itch, helps with eczema, psoriasis, and I just found out, is even an anti-fungal! Lots of power packed in a small tube. I'm in my twenties, and have acne-prone skin that's sensitive as can be, and dry as the Kalahari. Really. I may be the only person that when leaving my skin to it's own devices look as if I have a flaking sun burn all over my face. Attractive award over here everybody!That said, I use this stuff both day and night after a gentle cleanse, and it's stopped the peeling look dead in its track. My acne has improved since using it, instead of the usual breaking out when I find a actually moisturizing lotion, and my skin is hippie-baby soft.For  somebody without skin like a desert, this may be too heavy for day use, but it makes a fantastic night cream. With my skin, I find that immediately after applying I am slightly shiny, but this soaks in within 5 minutes and just makes me look dewey. With a layer of mineral powder foundation over top, I am completely matte.The calendula definitely comes through in the smell. Now, if you've never smelled a real calendula flower, it's in the marigold family, and has a slightly herby smell. I was worried that it would be off-putting to my tea-tree, rosemary, and similar scent hating guy, but he didn't even notice. It's not exactly a bad smell, and it does dissipate fairly quickly, but it is something to be aware of.Now, if you are actually looking at this product for a baby, I'd actually recommend getting a tube of"
25,B001FB5IQO,"I don't see any difference on my skin after two weeks of using it twice a day, but I will continue using it until the two bottles I bought are done. I'll update this review if anything changes. I noticed my neck was looking like ""turkey neck"" this totally toned it up again!! Been using every night for a few years and it's STILL TONING MY NECK!! IM now 58 and refuse to look like I'm old....THIS WORKS,AND ITS A MUST BUY!! First time I bought this cream was years ago.  A cellulite problem is a common problem that women have so I didn't really hope for much but just thought to give it a try. I was in my early 20s and had a lot of marks on my knee area (the back side). What the cream did just astonished me. It took care of those marks completely while I was using it leaving me speechless. Didn't do much to the cellulite though. Once I stopped using the cream - marks came right back to me. Years later I have decided to give it another try for the same results. Let's see if it helps, now that I'm 30. I've been using this product for some time and love it - So much so that I signed up for subscribe and save. In my August 2020 shipment it was listed and billed as a 2 pack but I only received one tube and haven't been able to find a way to report that other than returning the one tube I did receive... which I needed to keep up the regimen of twice daily. I've lost a lot of weight and this has helped tremendously with firming the loose skin. Disappointed in this seller and planning to cancel this subscription, I'll just order higher quantity of the single tubes.To update: I was able to chat online with representative  who arranged for another shipment, again listed on my Amazon orders as a 2 pk and again I only received one tube. I want to love this for the better price I get buying a 2 pk, but in reality I suspect I'll have to contact Amazon every month to actually receive the advertised 2. I used this product last year and it had better results that this year...funny because last year I was heavier and had worse cellulite then! The product did change its formula though so maybe thats why?I used this for 2 weeks twice a day for 20 minutes, massaging it very hard into my skin until I developed bruises. There was little effect on my cellulite however it did make my skin look much firmer and made my stretch marks almost disappear. I love the supple, firm feeling it gives me, I just wish it got rid of cellulite like it claims.Well! It can! I then bought the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt. What I did was rub the Nivea lotion over the areas until the skin was pretty wet. I took the mitt and massaged in into my skin for 10 minutes twice a day very roughly so bruises came. Within two days my minor cellulite was gone, within a week, the average looking cellulite was almost gone. I stopped using it for a few days, some of the cellulite has come back but not nearly as bad as before. I'm going to use it again to make it all go away. The mitt is so much better of an investment, its cheaper and it makes it so you don't go through as many nivea tubes. Your not supposed to use the mitt on dry skin, hence the reason I continue to use nivea. Actually I couldn't believe this product! It says that it will reduce thhe cellulite in 4 weeks and I've been using it for 2 weeks and it actually does what it say!!! I want to tell all women that I had serious cellulite problems that I thought no product can make it go away but this product really reduced the cellulite until now by nearly 70% and I haven't finished my 4 weeks yet!!!At first I couldn't believe that no product can reduce the appearance of cellulite but I was so desperate and tried everything but nothing worked. Except this one!!! And when you use it with the Nivea Serum Q10 it gives amazing results!! And the 2 packs will actually be enough for u for 4 weeks...I'm so happy I never had such toned legs since 5 years! I have been working out for 6 months and the cellulite wasn't going away. But if you work out, drink so much water (10 glasses a day) and use this product you will be amazed!! And believe me I have tried this without using this product and it didn't work before!Enjoy your new thighs ;) ;) :D Having gained a bit of extra weight over the past few months, I knew that something needed to be done before I visited Florida this summer. My legs showed a lot of cellulite that I wanted to get rid of. I did not have time to lose the extra weight before playing in the waves and lounging on the beach. I decided to see if this gel could help me. I have to say that it does work. You do need to use it every day or the results will go away. The skin on my legs looked and felt firm and smooth on the beach and in a bathing suit. I could not see the evidence of cellulite that had been so prevalent before using the gel. This truly made a huge difference. Even my teenaged daughter noticed and told me that my legs looked a whole lot better. Neither of us could believe the difference! Just remember to start using this product a minimum of two days before you want to see results. The longer you use it, the better. (I also decided to use this on my upper arms.) Pretty impressed. Been using for about a month. I apply it liberally after a bath or shower to my upper thigh (front and back) and there is a noticeable difference in the texture and appearance. I seriously would recommend this product if you have been struggling with other products and their lack of results. Don't be impatient with this product give yourself about 3 weeks to see some impact.  I will continue using and I am sure it can only continue to get better."
26,B001ET73D8,"SO, I typically like the Cetaphil brands and recently purchased the Oil-Free with SPF35 face moisturizing lotion. The one thing I cannot stand with moisturizers that contain the added layer of SPF protection is if you can smell the SPF protectant. It has a unique and offensive smell to me. I was SO happy to discover that this does NOT have an offensive smell at all. I can't even tell it has SPF in it, so this is EXCELLENT news for my face which by my Dermatologist is required for me to have sun protection more than 30 at all times on my face. The texture is thick and covers well. The only drawback to this is the dispenser. I found it very difficult to prime the first squirt. Actually nearly impossible which I ended up giving up and just taking the top off and applying on my face by dipping the straw tube into the bottle. I had my husband prime it later. It is now primed and the only other drawback is it does not consistently pump, so not sure how long the lotion will be coming out of the tube properly. When it does it is in very small doses. However, does seem to cover well enough even with the minute doses of the small pump action. I did contact Cetaphil to let them know they  need to improve on the dispenser. Other than the functionality issue, I'm VERY pleased with it. Not sure about how long and how well the SPF works, but I'm not using it as a suntan lotion. Not sure how well it works against the sun but I burn easily. So hopefully this will help. I also got it to help moisturize my skin so hopefully that will work as well. I will update if it doesn’t work.  Does have a slight smell to it smells like sunscreen I don’t hate it it’s not overpowering, but there is a scent to it. This order comes in a package of two packagesI got only one and payed for two Me gustó mucho la hidratación que deja a la piel y el plus del protector solar lo hace un producto muy bueno.y práctico. I switched from Olay to this brand when I needed something for more sensitive skin.  I love it! Great product! No white colour of the product seen on the skin Un poco grasosa. Pará mí piel Clumpy!"
27,B001FB5IMI,"Excellent product the best Nivea Exceptionally good for dry skin pleasant smell non greasy. Wife likes it, must be good Definitely like it....have used it for years! Good value for the money and good product’ This moisturizing creme is the best! It smells really good and it makes my skin, specifically my face, really soft. Before finding this my face was very dry and flaky because I was using the acne.org regimen. Their lotion wasn't moisturizing enough for my face and I didn't want everyone at school to see my face all dry. So I decided to do some research and this moisturizing creme came up and had a lot of positive reviews on it and I gave it a try. I am in love with it and have been using it for over 2 years and have recommended it to all 3 of my sisters. There's also a travel sized squeezable tube for this which is perfect for when I have to go on trips. Mild and dependable. LOVE this product.  I have been using it for 10 years and have turned all my coworkers on to it.  My bff male co-worker comes over to ask if he can have a dab all the time.  I keep a pod at home, one in my bag and one at the office.  I use it after I wash my hands and I gotta tell you, New England winters are brutal, you need this stuff. I slather my hands, face and sometimes legs in it before bed.  It soaks in and in the morning I'm super soft.  I think it's helped as a ton of people say I don't look my age.  Hey, I'll take it! Three years ago, I discovered this body creme and I've never looked back. A few criteria that are important to me when I lotion: 1) The product cannot leave an oily residue, 2) It has to smell pretty good & be gender neutral (i.e. I don't want to smell like a man and I don't want my boyfriend smelling like a woman), 3) It has to work, even in the dry cold New England winters and even after daily swim practice where the chlorine wreaks havoc on any skin.Nivea's Soft creme works wonders! It's light and delicate with a subtle ""fresh"" scent and is refreshingly moisturizing. It locks in my skin's moisture post shower without being oily. And the container is the perfect shape -- you will never have to awkwardly squeeze the last few bits of lotion out of a bottle or tube again."
28,B001ABLKK2,"THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. When I ordered this product, I had previously done a whole research on Asian skin care products and found out that most of them were really expensive and sometimes didn't even work. So when I came across Cure Natural Aqua Gel on a Youtuber's Channel and found it was really inexpensive, with positive reviews, I was really excited to try it out. It arrived really fast and with no problems. My product was easy to apply since it came with English instructions on the back. When I applied it on my face, slowly and gently massaging it, I felt a bunch of little balls coming off. I was surprised that such a soft and gentle exfoliator could have such an enormous effect, so I checked the product to see if it had any hidden balls within it but found none. So, as I like to think, I conducted a small experiment that goes as follows:  ""Since some parts of our bodies have higher or lower concentration of dead cells, if I use the same amount of product on these areas I should get a different amount of dead cells. And if I get the same amount of ""balls"" it means it is all within the product. (Making sense? It does in my head XD)I decided to test two areas: 1) The elbows, 2) The faceWhy? Well, if there is a part of the body people clean(or at least within my family) it's the face. I know I am too lazy to scrub my body every single day and thus my elbows don't get such a nice treatment. Besides, elbows are a joint where skin accumulates, thus more dead cells. ( I am not an expert)Procedure:So I pumped twice and applied it on my elbow which I know has a big concentration of dead cells. And as hypothesized( if you like to think of it that way ;D) a big amount of balls formed. Then, I applied the same amount of product to a part of my dad's face as equal in surface area as that of my elbows (I had already exfoliated mine so it doesn't count). My conclusion was that the product truly works, because the same amount of product generated different amounts of balls, meaning it must have reacted to the skin. It's a weird way of testing it out and I know many factors could have influenced the answers but all you really need as proof, is the feel of your skin.Review: To really appreciate a product I write down my expectations VS. reality and with these, I draw my ""real expectations"" because having realistic expectations in mind really help to appreciate any product and understand it's value. For me these were my Expectations Vs RealityExpectationsYes, we all have wished our acne would simply disappear, together with the scars and all those skin problems after one application. ""My skin will turn to a beautiful and healthy glowing and perfect skin.""RealityAfter years of doing nothing to my skin( I am guilty -.-), it won't go away magically, and if it does call me. Skin needs time to repair, so I have to be patient. There is no ""perfect"" skin so I should love my skin the way it is even though I look like a Mexican version of a vampire.Results The product is as gentle as you want it to be( if your not gentle with your skin you can scar it even more -.- like I did when I exfoliated with sugar and rubbed so hard on my skin). It has only being 2 weeks, and  My acne is still there, but it has tremendously dwindled. I used to have acne all over my cheeks and now I only get one pimple every other day. My skin doesn't ""glow"" in the dark (LOL) but it does look a little more healthy and not so dull. The product has caused no ""after effects"", it is pleasant to use and has done close to magic for my skin \(^_^)/OVER ALL I am so happy with this beautiful product sent from heaven. I have lived with acne my whole life like a lot of people, and I did my research, bought this product and now I am happy. It is worth every penny, and it does wonders(at least to my face), fast shipping, you name it.I use this product with my skin care routine which is as follows:1) A make up remover (if you wear make up, I don't so I can't recommend any but oils are good too if you want a more natural way)2) A cleanser- use any of your preference, i haven't found a favorite yet.3) An exfoliator- THIS ONE!4) A toner- for this I use half Apple cider vinegar and half water because i don't like the idea of rubbing any alcohol product on my face.5)A moisturizer- Even if I have oily skin, I moisturize my skin(I think is very important but can't tell if it will make it worst for others or not) I recommend Aveeno6) Masks- sometimes I use honey for my red scars, or clay masks work too (Indian Clay)7) A Spray - Avene Thermal Spring water spray is great to keep face moisturize if you don't want to apply face cream often, its a lighter feeling.Sorry for my bad English, Spanish is my first language. This is only my opinion and my craziness :D So I was sold on all the positive reviews, before buying... and that's why I bought this.  In the back of my mind, I didn't know what to expect.Some background: I'm a 37-year old fair-skinned Asian-American male.  I have had a facial skincare routine every day of my life since I turned 30 years old.  For 5 years, as far as cleansing goes, I was always using Stridex daily, and 2x a month using an acid exfoliator (the Olay serum/scrub kit).  For the last couple years, I have switched to a basic water-based cleanser, and every 6-12 weeks I have applied either a 15% or 25% TCA chemical peel. In other words, I'm no stranger to what exfoliation feels like.As a kid, growing up, in the bath or shower, I would often scratch or rub my arms or legs to really give myself a deep clean.  It would produce these ""strands"" of dead epidermis.  But I would have to rub those areas really hard.Well, this ""CURE"" gel basically eliminates the need for all that rubbing/scratching.  You rub gently over your face and within 15 seconds, sure enough, the epidermis starts to flake or ""ball"" off!Now, before I purchased, I read some people saying that if this was really your skin, that you'd be suffering from burns on your face.  And I have two responses: (1) each time I apply this ""CURE"" gel, I squirt 4 pumps into my hands, and cover my face with it, and it appears to take off somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 of (the dead stratum corneum layer of) my epidermis skin layer; and (2) a lot of the skin that is flaking or balling off is actually from your HANDS, not your face!Of course, you've read the reviews that claim that this product does nothing.Well, so I ran all the following tests:(a) First, when I wore a plastic glove and rubbed the gel between my fingers, there was absolutely ZERO balling, even after rubbing 3 minutes until it dried.  So, that basically eliminated all these claims in these negative 1-star reviews that it was due to coagulation of the gel.(b) Then, I applied the lotion once, rinsed off, applied again, rinsed off, and applied again, rinsed off.  Each of those 3 times I had the balling/flaking results.  3 times!  Now, a note: by the time I rinsed off the third time, my skin was dry and stinging.  It was the same kind of stinging I get from applying a 15% TCA peel!  Maybe not as strong, so maybe it's similar to a 7% TCA peel, but the sensation is definitely the same.  And that stinging sensation comes where the TCA peel most affects me--around my nostrils, and under my chin.(c) My third experiment was on a separate evening, where I applied the lotion with a plastic glove (you can also wear a plastic sandwich bag, like a glove, instead).  This time, on the 3rd pass, I no longer got the balling/flaking results.  Instead, when I used the leftover gel from this 3rd pass attempt on my forearm, well, the dead epidermis started to ball/flake.(d) My last experiment was to try applying this in the shower.  And it didn't work!  This gel doesn't work at all if you try to apply it to a wet face.  It only works (and works REALLY well!) if you apply it to a clean dry face!!!The results are remarkable.  My skin is glowing after using this product.So after reading all this, what am I trying to tell you?:  #1:  This stuff is for real, most definitely.  The stuff balling up is most definitely your dead epidermis.  #2:  It's best to apply this with something, instead of direct contact with your hands.  I will continue using a plastic glove or plastic bag to apply.  #3.  If you decide to apply this 2-3 times in a row, you may exfoliate all your epidermis, and you better cover up with an SPF lotion.  #4.  Only apply on a dry face!I hope this helps some of you in your usage or purchasing decisions.  Cheers.1-WEEK UPDATE: If you wear a plastic glove while applying, you may need to rub with significantly more pressure because the plastic is slick and there's no friction to rub the surface epidermis away. But more amazingly, after about a week of use, it has gently removed about 30% of a discoloration caused by a popped pimple.  Usually I have to wait months for it to go away, or I use deep exfoliation on it and it gets irritated and sticks around longer. Finally, after a week of use, I've also discovered that my Ponds pore strips are much more effective now on my pores.  Overall, I'm convinced that the balling of skin looks so strange because it is an agglomeration ('mixture') of both your dead skin and the product itself (which isn't so far-fetched given that the product isn't supposed to necessarily magically disappear!). I'm quite happy with the gentleness of this product. Literally the best exfoliate I have ever used!!! Please buy this!! It works on sensitive skin as it is water based & I can’t live without this product!! Used to have a lot of breakouts and my rosacea was really bad and I started using this for a solid year now my face has looked great I soak and exfoliate my whole body weekly but it's so hard to soak your face / neck and I end up with dead skin behind my ears and dry patches on my face.But this makes it so easy!! Just wash your skin, dry completely, then use Cure! I use once to twice per week and my makeup goes on much smoother! It’s available when I need it❤️"
29,B00027DMSI,"Ya’ll, I don’t know what to think about these.  I’ve gone through two boxes.  I put them on every night before bed and leave them on for a full 12 hours.  I have not missed a day.  I typically use 3 squares for the lines on my forehead.  The lines aren’t terrible, but they bug me and seem accentuated while wearing makeup.  I don’t have any 11’s, so these are strictly horizontal lines that come from my expressive eyebrows.These don’t irritate my skin, but the glue smells a bit.  These are essentially the same concept as Biore pore strips.  Same type of glue and the paper gets hard as it dries.  The first few times removing them were PAINFUL because it was yanking out all my baby hairs.So—yes, when I take them off, the wrinkles are essentially smoothed.  However, that really doesn’t last long if your face makes any sort of movement.  Which brings me to my dilemma: should I keep trying to see if a few more months down the line will provide longer lasting results?  These are pricy.  I have another set arriving next week, so I plan to go through that set, as well.  I will say these are way more preferable than Smoothies.  Those felt so restrictive on my skin and definitely gave less results.  For whatever reason, they just felt horrible to wear.  I thought about alternating the two but I always just want to rip the Smoothies off whereas I don’t notice the Frownies are even on my face.  I will update when I know more.Also—some refill sets would be nice.  I feel bad getting that nice cardboard box over and over when they just get tossed.  I would rather just be sent the refills in the plastic wrap and use the boxes I already have. I’ve been using these for about 6 months and I do think they have helped my 11s. They’ve had an unexpected side effect I think is even more valuable though: I suffer from chronic migraines and I often wake up with them. While I’m asleep my whole face clenches in pain (spouse has shown me photos and I’m frowning fiercely) which just makes the pain worse because my facial muscles get sore. It’s a feedback loop—pain causes frowning causes pain. Frownies however stop that pained face clenching and I’ve noticed I wake up with fewer severe headaches now. I think it breaks one side of the feedback loop. I’ll definitely keep using them for vanity AND for headaches. SO I have been using these for a few years. I agree with most of the reviews - they do have a funky smell - but whatever - after I remove them my lines between my eyebrows are almost non existent and they do come back by the end of the day.  However, I am convinced that the lines would be so much worse if I were not using them. Some tips for use: I have noticed that I can reuse the patches 3-4 times if I use my retinol serum to apply them (instead of the recommended rose water). When I peal it off in the AM it does pull at my skin but I dont have any terrible reaction to it so for me thats a non issue. When I dont use them - I immediately can tell because the lines are so much worse. So while these will not take your wrinkles away forever, they do help prevent them from getting worse. I will continue to use and recommend them for anyone trying to stay ahead of the wrinkle:-) I really wanted to like this product and can say that I may not have given the product the length of time to see the results it claims to give. I struggled with the adhering and placement of the Frownies. I watched YouTube’s online to try and figure out where and how to place them as I felt the instructions that came with the product were a tad vague. I felt once I placed them on they really weren’t doing anything other than just being a sticker stuck to my face. I thought they would be strong enough to pull my skin back and hold it into place allowing the wrinkles to soften. I realize it talks about how the frownies help with muscle relaxation training which I can not attest to as I didn’t give the product the length of time it suggested. I also did not like the feeling of having these on my face overnight or waking up and taking them off as my skin is sensitive. They may work for some but I feel there is a learning curve to it! First off - they do smell. The first time you use you will be so grossed out. But you get used to it and it’s worth it.First picture is before. Second is a little over a month into using. Again - it’s not Botox. But if you can’t/don’t want Botox - this is probably your next best bet. I have also heard of people extending their Botox results with these patches.Overall, I have been using for a little over a month. The first month I used it every night and now I use it every night or every couple of nights - whenever I feel like it. You do have to wear it continuously to keep your results. My wrinkles definitely were better when I was using every night but they still look better then when I first started. Give them a shot! It really works! I really like it and I haven't even used for a month yet but very noticeable difference.Pros:-cost - i only use 4 triangles which is one sheet. and it will last for a long time-it is really easy to use and customizable.- IT WORKS! when i am awake i try not to frown  but when i am sleeping, I frown so much that it doesn't matter how much i try not to frown during the day time. this really helps to not to use my forehead muscle while I am sleeping.Cons:- it smells kinda like spit?-as it dries, it creates almost cast like form and sometime it doesn't stay  on the skin. there is air bubble inside and it is less effective when that happens. I have to hold it for a WHILE to keep that from happening.overall It is the most effective one i found and I see that it can be a botox alternative."
30,B001F51TNQ,"I have been using Olay products for years and, frankly, I like some of the more traditional ones, like these, better than some of the newer ones.  These products keep my skin soft and almost erase wrinkles, and they are affordable! It's the perfect blend to keep me moisturized and just the right amount of scent. Not overpowering! Well done Olay Scent is a little strong but other than that product is a good value and moisturizing. I use oil of Olay night cream every night. I ordered these and realized they were not my regular cream. Since I know all their products I’m using it but I just don’t care for the scent. My skin get dry and I  like the way it moisturizes  my face, I've been using this product for years. All I use is Olay for bath, sunscreen, facial products for day and night. I'm  76 and been told my skin is that of a 60 year old. That says it all. Used this product before and liked it. Aging wrinkles"
31,B0002JGU30,"It is very nice, smooth, and creamy. Spreads easily on your skin. I use it as a rule, right after my shower. When my skin is just enough moist and still warm.  The refreshing lemony smell lingers for a few minutes after applying but does not ""harass"" you by following you the entire day. Like some of them, where their goal is to just let the smell smother you all day. No thank you. This is by far the best that I used. I am 70 and lived in a few countries and tried a few things. So, trust me. This product  leaves you feeling refreshed and soothes your senses.And important it's  not heavy  and pampers your skin. My super sensitive nose can't handle many scents but lemon isn't one of them. Luckily this lotion smells  like lemon without the smell of an added chemical. My skin feels so soft and hydrated.  The smell is not overpowering and a lovely scent.  It pairs well with my shower soap and shampoo. Happy with order I love the non-greasy feel and light scent of this lotion.Price was fair and entire transaction was pleasant. I've used their products before and have been happy.  I didn't give 5 stars on all because I didn't think it was necessarily applicable to me.  I live in a very dry state so moisturizing is relative.  It feels good when applied, but living in AZ you have to constantly apply lotion and lip gloss. I purchased the lemon scent and I absolutely love it. It makes my hands so soft without being greasy"
32,B001EUS64M,"I like that it has a light fragrance and my face feels clean and soft. Also it takes eye makeup off great. I love these for travel & camping.  So soft, so wet, nice scent.  No matter where I wake-up I feel clean and attractive. I got these makeup wipes because I wanted to try them and they were on sale for Prime Day. The scent is pleasant, not too strong. They clean decently, though not the best. They don't moisturize, however they don't dry out either. They were okay. I'm going to try a brand with a better deal. But if they aren't good, I'll buy these again. I ordered 2 of these, they came obviously came together. The problem is when you pull out a sheet you get 2 sheets. And you have too stuff 1 sheet that is a square back in a hole that is a circle. Now if you don't know the sticky cover never lasts ever. They really need to come up with a better hole cover. Lo mejor es la textura de toalla.,no percibo fragancia. Good product! Did not see like the in packaging I have used these wipes for several years. I love how they remove all of my make-up while being gentle on my skin."
33,B001DI776S,"My wife & I are in and out of the back door often… taking care of little jobs that require a quick hand-washing. We typically keep a bottle of Dr. Bronzer’s liquid soap by the sink. It’s gentle, effective, and comes in a variety of fragrances. I’m fond of the lemongrass-lime, because the scent is particularly subtle. I fell in love with Saya's Lime and Lemongrass body soap and was hoping on a wish and a prayer that this would smell the same because it's half the price. It does not. It smells like bug spray. We cannot tell whether we like the soap yet because we cannot open it.  The first bottle had a broken dispenser top.  Rather than waste money and energy, we bought another one and planned on refilling the container with the old broken top one when we finished the second container.  We have not been able to get the container to open yet.We got it open, but it is not apparent when it is open or closed.  It has a nice fresh scent and rinses off nicely like the other Dr. Bronner's products. For some reason this lemongrass lime does not lather like the other fragrances. Not my preference! Bottle had the top broken off and soap spilled all into the box and bag. Product is fine, but needs to be better protected for shipping, otherwise you get half of what you paid for. Described as a 24 ounce bottle, received a single 12 ounce bottle. When the pandemic shortages in local stores made items hard to find, I ordered this hand soap from Amazon. Before this hand soap arrived, my knuckles had little tiny cuts from dry skin--a combination of winter dry air and more frequent hand washing. Initially, I just hoped for a pleasant herbal fragrance. Imagine my surprise when this soap not only smelled nice, but actually moisturized my skin well enough to cure the cuts. I had been using hand lotion a LOT more often, now I rarely need to use it. I'm now on my second generous-sized bottle of this soap. I will continue to use it. One note: the pump on this bottle is really strong. A full pump will provide enough soap for a bath! Now I just use a gently push to get lots of soap. Love the product but the seller clearly states the bottle contains 24 ounces and I received a bottle containing 12 ounces!"
34,B000KONYPY,"I ordered this face cream and have enjoyed using it every day. Moisturizes and feels great on you after use.Love this face cream! keep coming back to this At age 60, I have to expect some lines and wrinkles. While I’ve accepted that, I’m still doing all I can to keep them as invisible as possible. This night cream definitely makes a difference. It’s very moisturizing, but not greasy. It doesn’t give me acne or other skin irritation. In fact, I use it for daytime and nighttime, and love the results.The price is not bad for what you get. A 1.7 oz jar lasts about 3 months for me. Worth every penny. This cream is very nice but if you are scent sensitive, plan to use this during the day.  I tried it at night and couldn’t even get to sleep till I washed my face again.  But I use it during the day and it is light and makes my skin feel hydrated.  The rose fragrance dissipates after a few hours so I can use up the container but I probably won’t buy more.  It is a nice scent and I’m sorry I’m too sensitive with migraine to use it at night. Facial night time moisturizer Good light moisturizer Buen producto exactly what we wanted"
35,B001G7PMOK,"Great product, great price Olay Age Defying Cream is the best ever. I have used this special cream since I was in my teens and I know am in my 50s. My family doesn't understand why I don't have any wrinkles and mainly it's because not only I eat healthy but this special cream has a lot to do with it. My skin is always moisturized and firm throughout the day and I reapply it day and night after I wash my face with Olay cleanser. It's important to keep your skin clean, moisturized, and looking good. If you haven't tried a moisturizer try out Olay you won't be disappointed. I've been using this for several years  now, and this was the best price I've found.I LOVE the way my skin feels when I use this -  Soooo soft, and I've started using it on  my neck, chest, shoulders, and arms, too. (If I'm still wet from the shower, it really goes a long way.) It's amazing in how soft it makes your skin, and I  noticed a  real difference very quickly.That said, this is pretty much doing nothing about wrinkles, so if you want it  for that, you may want to keep looking. My wrinkles are pretty minor still, but that was the reason I originally started trying this stuff. I was diligent, and took pictures in the same lighting conditions every week for quite a while, then monthly, but I still see no difference in the wrinkle situation. (though it doesn't seem to be getting worse, either.)I still use it after every shower, despite not helping on the wrinkles. It's THAT great on making my skin feel great. I've never felt a lotion make that big a difference so quickly. I'd give it 5 stars, if they got rid of the claim that it helps with wrinkles (age defying). It's also kind of expensive, but this vendor, and a 2-pack are a good deal. OK I liked the price of this product. I use it as a face moisturizer in the morning. In my teens I used an Olay moisturizer that I absolutely loved. This one is no different. I'm now in my mid-20s and starting to notice fine lines on my forehead - my first go-to is Olay. I wasn't looking for something to take layers off my skin and leave it dry and peeling - I needed a moisturizer. On a scale of 1-10 (super-lightweight to thick and heavy) this is probably around a 3.5. I don't feel like I am soaking in lotion after I put it on my face and neck, which is quite nice. The smell is nice, light and not offensive. I have noticed that my lines look a little less noticeable but I've also noticed that if I use another lotion for a couple days, they come back. This isn't a quick fix but it is a good facial moisturizer that won't clog your pores and will leave your complexion looking like a baby's bottom as long as you use it on a regular basis. Its definitely a good buy! Love the mild scent. Lasts a long time because it’s a two-pack. Oh I just love this skin cream. I used to buy this particular line of Olay quite sometime ago, but then it seemed to suddenly disappear of the shelves one day. There are so many different variations of Olay skin cream, but this one has always been my favorite and I was so happy to have found it again :) It's very gentle and easy on sensitive skin. It won't make you look 20 years younger (unfortunately) but you will see some subtle results within the first few uses. I would highly recommend giving it a try!"
36,B001G773BU,"I wish I had known of this product sooner!!! I have a skin condition known as folliculitis- which is basically when the hair follicles have a hard time getting through the skin and tend to become trapped and irritated just under the skin and produces little raised bumps. I remember that when I would go to the beach and swim around in the water how good my skin felt after being exposed to the sea salt. It helped clear up any acne and made my skin feel super soft after showering. This works fantastic for a similar effect. It DOES NOT soap up. You use this after your shower on clean, damp skin and just run the salt bar on your skin. You may feel a very slight burn if you have areas that irritated or open, but it quickly goes away within a minute. It does not leave a grainy residue afterwards- which would be unpleasant in my opinion. I usually will not apply any lotion or moisturizer until I go to bed- simply because that is my normal routine. This does not dry your skin- in fact it seems to help retain the skins natural moisture without any additional product. It is also naturally retards bacteria, so it is very effective for my skin condition since it and kills bacteria and removes dead skin that allows the hair follicles to penetrate the skin without becoming trapped. I would highly recommend this for those with folliculitis or eczema as a natural remedy that really works. I was so excited about this product, that before it arrived I have been using a pink Himalayan salt chunk as my “soap bar” until this one arrived. I have had great results so far, but the bar is far better and smoother to use-leaving no grainy salt feeling. I have tried tons of products for my skin condition (exfolliants, sulfur based soaps, prescription lactic acid creams, etc) and none have works as well as the salt treatment. I look forward to continued use and clearer skin using this treatment, and I will definitely continue this regime. These bar should last a very long time, so it is a great price for months of treatment. I hope my review was helpful. I am having great results! I rinse my face with warm water, wet the bar, rub it on a washcloth I also wet with warm water and, then use the washcloth on my face. The bar is crazy sharp and will cut your skin if you use it directly on it unless you have a smooth part. I used it on my very red face and neck that has been very red from rosacea and my previous soap caused lots of bumps all over (my pores all seemed bumpy). I noticed that some red spots seemed to get way more red and some itchy. I posted a question about whether that happened to others and started to use it on a test spot to see if that got red bumps to see if maybe it was an allergy. I kept using it though in case the bar was drawing issues out from under my skin up to the surface and maybe would result in clearer skin in the end. This is what happened to me. Two weeks of using this bar three times a day, my face was no longer completely red, but did have some red spots. My neck rosacea got so itchy, but was noticeably less red. More just a bunch of very itchy raised spots like a rash. But the test spot showed no redness or bumps so I stayed with it. Now at 1 month spots and redness is almost completely gone. There is still one red spot not raised about the size of a quarter under my eye. Let's see what happens. I wet my face first and do not rinse the salt off. I will brush extra salt off if it is noticeable once dry. I plan on adding a drop of jojoba oil to my routine if my skin gets dry. I am seeing any blemishes as the bar clearing them out. I am very in to natural remedies and so happy to have found something that is natural and getting such a major result. I'm a kale-eating, oil-pulling, dry-brushing, all-around health nut, but you gotta be hard-core to like and use this soap. It's not for everyone. If you're considering it, here are few things to know before you buy:1. it doesn't lather. You're just rubbing salt on your wash cloth, and then scrubbing your skin with a salty cloth.2. You can rub the salt--GENTLY!--directly on your skin, but if there are exposed salt crystals, they can scratch your skin.3. You must thoroughly rinse your skin or you will be itchy. This is a big one.4. It's hard and it's heavy. If you drop it, it makes a big crash, and it can break apart.5. Another reviewer said it lasted a while. Mine does not. The first bar I foolishly left in the wettest spot in my shower, and it dissolved in under a week. (duh) I'm on to my second bar, and it's lasting longer on the shelf in the back of the shower.I have to say that after three weeks' use, I feel cleaner all day long. And I don't smell by the end of the day. I was impressed with that. Also, I think my skin feels softer. I have some eczema, which was why I purchased it in the first place, but the jury's still out on whether it's helping to clear up the rash.  And--it's very pretty to look at.My husband doesn't like it. He says he associates lather with getting clean. So there's that."
37,B0013OFRUK,"I really like this. It gives me the protection I need and helps me to lighten my scars because of the sun protection. People complain about the initial white cast but so long as you don’t put on too much and you allow it a minute or two to absorb, you’re good to go! I just got back from a week in Cancun. It’s all day in the sun and water.. a great combination to burn!  But I never did. My skin stayed clear and never dried out  I am now wearing it daily under my makeup.  I’m completely hooked I have not use it yet but so far I like what I see. I tested it on a small area and it felt very soft, easy to spread, and I like the smell. Siempre batallo con mi piel xqe es muy sensible pero esto es lo mejor que e tenido lo recomendaria siempre me compuso mi cara practicamente porq hasta unos granitos qe tenia se me quitaron This is the best face sunscreen I have ever used.I work outside on boats and on the water. My face is constantly getting burned. I have been using regular sunscreen, and it's just aweful!!!! The spray on stuff doesn't work very well, it's greasy and burns my skin. It messes up my makeup, when I sweat it runs into my eyes and burns my eyes, it makes it's way into my mouth and tastes terrible all day and at the end of the day I am a shiney greasy mess....who still has a sunburn.The lotion isn't any better, it opens and clogs my pores and just seriously makes my skin and face look terrible on top of all the other problems I have with the spray on sunscreen. I feel like I could never apply enough sunscreen and I dreaded it every time.I was searching for face sunscreen because surely there has to be a better option, when I came across this.It said it was dry to the touch and matte as well as long lasting.I was skeptical but needed something different so I gave it a try.At first it feels like regular sunscreen but it dries and gets non greasy really fast. Like within seconds it goes from regular sunscreen to this amazing finish that actually makes my skin look a little better than it did.Each one of my boat tours is around 2 hours each. I reapply between each tour and I haven't gotten burnt since. I have had no problems with sunscreen sweating or getting splashed into my eyes which is super important because I am the lead boat and if I cannot see traffic in the harbor I am putting all of the other boats in danger.It doesn't get in my mouth since it's not super runny and messy.I get home from work and I don't look like my face is melting off.Seriously I cannot tell you how valuable this product is to me. It has solved so many problems in my daily life and I am so grateful that they thought to come up with this. Finally a sunscreen with no white cast! Although I am very very pale i haven't noticed a cast. Doesnt feel gross under makeup either ! I live in Santa Fe, where the sun shines 300 days a year, and at 7000', it is vital.  I bought this after looking at many sunscreens and like how easy it is to put on; there is no white haze on my face, it dries quickly, and my makeup sits nicely on top of it.  I like the max coverage of 70 SPF and Neutrogena's brand.  I will reorder this when I run out, which will be quite a while, as a little goes a long way. I bought this for my husband. His son burns easily. He feel comfortable with it. No reaction. And it did the trick. He did get a little sunburn but I think it's just because we were out in the sun all day. I would definitely buy this again."
38,B000ODNSR0,"I started self-tanning and did some research on how to make my tan last longer. This product was recommended as a good daily body wash, along with the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion. I've been using the body wash and lotion for several months and am very happy with it. It has a nice mild scent and my tan stays on great. As an added note to those who self-tan, it's best to apply this product with just your hands. Although it may be obvious to most, using any type of loofah sponge or wash cloth will cause your self tan to rub off unevenly. It does leave your skin feeling a bit slimy, but it definitely moisturizes and has helped me a great deal with itchy skin and dry areas.  It also creates a luxurious, thick foam that I really appreciate. This was my first time trying aveeno body wash and It won’t be the last. They’re definitely moisturizing for my dry winter skin I have super-sensitive skin.  Everything I used seemed to give me chemical burns.  Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Wash is all I use now.  When I discovered that the Body Wash is available in this refill bag, I bought it and WOW!!  One refill fills up a liter size bottle.  I am really trying to watch ""extra packaging"", so I felt great that Aveeno now offers refill packaging. Why did I wait so long?  I've used Aveeno lotion for 4 decades.  This body wash is very hydrating and feels so luxurious.  Really feels like I don't need lotion. Pretty well moisturizes skin and does not leave a film. Fragrance extremely light.  Nice for bathing (additional time to allow Aveeno to soak in to your skin) Also great for all family members, infant to senior adult. I LOVE this body wash!!! Very creamy, hardly any scent and me feeling clean and soft. If your skin is super dry YOU NEED THIS!!!!!! No joke, i used to use small grain sand paper to exfoliate and then put Aveeno lotion on. This body wash is fantastic!"
39,B000UVZU1S,"Website states unscented, however, I apparently, got some in and around my eyes when I washed my face in the morning and my eyes started itching.  After itchy eyes for days,  read the ingredient list today on the container and it shows “fragrance” (parfum).  So disappointed since this product is cruelty-free and so reasonably priced..Update:  Since I cannot use this moisturizer on my face —tried once more and my skin started to get a slight burning sensation so I washed it off.  I have been diagnosed with hyper-sensitive skin.  I really liked the very nice creaminess, so I decided to use the remainder on my feet and ankles, and it does a great job softening those areas without skin irritation or allergic reaction so far.  However, I sadly won’t purchase again since I really shouldn’t be absorbing fragrance into my pores.  Maybe St Ives will come out with a fragrance-free product. I am 76 years old and have used this cream for many,  many years and hope they don’t discontinue  it! . I use this every morning and is a good base for makeup if you have dry skin . It has protected me from the sun as well and inexpensive . Other family members seem to use it as well on occasion . I've spent an insane amount of money on high end face creams and this one beats ALL OF THEM. I have combo skin, and it moisturizers my dry spots and doesn't make my t-zone appear oily. It works wonders during the winter. And it's $6! What are you waiting for? I have sensitive skin, and so I generally try to avoid all products with scents.  However, I find the scent of St. Ives to be very mild and unoffensive.  The product makes my skin feel soft and not greasy.  I've been using it for years. This moisturizer is amazing. Goes on so smooth. Skin drinks it up. Leaves skin feeling soft, but noisturized.Bought a 2nd in case they stop selling it Have used St. Ives skin products for many years - interesting to see new packaging.  Moisturizing  skin cream has been around for ages and it works well - lovely and light and no strong scent. Recommend over very expensive creams that do nothing. Very moisturizing- I use ot on my face and hands and saw results when i woke up the next day.I truly recommend this product.Ten Stars !!! ❣ St. Ives provides great moisture for the face without the greasy feeing many such products leave on faces."
40,B000U5O650,"This is such a great toner for those with sensitive skin and those of us with adult acne and hormonal acne. I have been using this product for years and will continue to use it because it has helped my skin so much. You never know how much dirt you might be leaving behind until you wash your face and then wipe your face with a cotton pad and some toner and you’ll be surprised how amazing this stuff is at getting out that dirt and grime that was still deep down in those pores and crevices! I highly recommend this toner! It’s one of my skincare ride or die products! I really love the scent it smells super clean and light and definitely doesn’t smell like a lot of toners I have tried in the past. It’s not super drying like other toners. The ad and written description are on point and accurate. I like this product a lot and would buy it again. Teresa R. 3/4/2023 I love the way it feels and removes any residue on my skin. I like it Works good on older skin. Very fresh and clean. Love this stuff Very soothing after removing makeup.  Smooths the skin and seems to cleanse even more. Gentle, clean scent"
41,B000YG82HI,"I got this for my wife to try out, and she liked it so much, I've had to keep ordering more. She says this is a good moisturizer, and really helps her skin feel better. She has sensitive skin too, so this is a big plus that it doesn't cause her any issues, and it does what it's designed to do, with NO side effects. I do think it's over-priced, but, if it makes my wife happy, price is of no concern. It’s perfect for my skin! Okay, so I had to review this product because I am blown away!  First it smells amazing, but I love citrus smell.  It glides right on and absorbs quickly.  I will warn you my face felt hot and my skin was a little red.  I put the cream on top and went to bed.  In the morning my skin looked brighter and more clear...beautiful!  Hydrated and some of the more faint pregnancy mask spots were lighter.  I love love it!  I have worked in skincare for 16 years and have sensitive skin: I get rashes and hives very easily.  The warmth and the redness were just the ingredients working.  You have to know your skin...know when it is truly an allergic reaction and when it is just active ingredients working.  Many great treatments you may feel a tingle etc. especially hydoxy acids or vitamin c products. They are working and it goes away shortly.  Serums/treatments tend to be stronger because they go deeper than creams.  I even wore it during the day under my moisturizer and makeup.  I was a little red at first but then it went away.  Did not disturb my makeup at all.  My skin was balanced and hydrated all day...very smooth and bright.  It feels warm when it is on, but only for a short while.  I am using the whole Avalon Vitamin C line and am in love!  I will probably only use the serum at night since it is so active and to not waste it.  I use the Cream, Milk cleanser, and toner too.  I am very very happy I bought this product and highly reccommend. Google effects This great antioxidant is the first thing that goes on my face under a sunscreen moisturizer and foundation. I love the subtle orange scent which doesn’t affect my allergies and disappears after a few minutes. It seems to have helped my skin to be more clear and smooth. The product claims that it tones, improve the  texture and  clarity of your skin. I have oily-acne prone skin. I use it to get rid of my old and new acne scar.... i have been using this for three weeks or so now and I have to say it does lighten up my acne scar. usually my acne scars would not leave my face until a couple months later but the Vitamin C serum really help fasten up the process. It doesn't make me break out in what I've seen. I am not really excited about the smell.. smells like a weird or rotting oranges... even my boyfriend said my face smells of orange when he kissed me (which i think its kinda funny but a little embarrassing, but i guess it's better than having scars/ i use my moisturizer to cover this weird smell). The serum is a little sticky in my opinion.. not oily, doesn't clog my pores,  i'm still using it.. I will use the whole product , as of right now I will be planning to purchase a new one once i am done with this.I got sent the wrong Avalon Organics Vitamin C facial serum, instead they sent me the eye serum instead... soo i wasn't too happy about that. Other than that I do like this. I love this serum.  It is my all-time favorite.  My only quibble is that it is a bit on the expensive side. Cost aside, this is the one I buy most often.  I cannot comment on the wrinkle / fine line reducing effect, as this is not the reason that I use it.  I use this in place of a facial lotion each morning.  I absolutely hate face lotion and refuse to use it.  Regardless of brand, I don't like how thick they are, I can feel them on my face all day, and I never like the smell of any of them.  Vitamin C  serum is my savior.  I have used many brands, but this is by far  the best as far as I am concerned. This one leaves my skin feeling super silky and ready for makeup. I don't feel it after I apply it and the scent is extremely lite and natural. Avalon Organics is also an environmentally conscious company and does not test on animals.  I would rather give my money to them than to a company with different/unknown ethics. Applied at night"
42,B000SX3380,"I’ve never used tanning lotion because I was fearful of looking like an orange. It’s winter and I was little pale and wanted to warm up my color. I figured I’d give this product a try because of the towelettes and that it would be easy to apply. There were no streaks. Everything was evenly distributed during the application process. The color was soft and reminded me of a soft bronzer. There’s 10 towelettes per pack, which I only used one per application. I think overall it’s a good value for the money and I like te results. So easy to use! One wipe is enough for both legs. The color is extremely natural and lasts a few days. I apply at night after I shower, it dries in seconds, and then I shower in the morning. I honestly can’t go without these wipes, I’ve been using them for years. Nice color.  Not orange.  Lasts for days.  Dries quickly.  Wish it was a little less $$ Nocr Have used self tanners for over 20 yrs including the high end ones sold at cosmetic counters at luxury retail stores.  These are easier to use and last better than all the other name brand tanners I have used.  Two Tips- 1. Never apply on totally dry skin,  use when skin is damp, like after showering and towel drying off, you get more even and natural coverage that way.  2. Do not apply to knees, feet & ankles or elbows & hands first, as they tend to be drier and absorb more product.  Apply to those areas after you apply to the rest of body when the towelette has less product in it.  I start face, neck, lower legs, arms, upper legs, then rest of body and do elbows, knees, feet & ankles last.  Be thorough and follow up with lotion.  Lotioning after not before allows the product to absorb better and you get less issues with lines from sandal straps, etc. One box lasts about 2 mos. in summer.  In warm months, I apply 2-3 times per week, it gradually wears off with each shower.  It is the most natural looking tanner for me, I have found on the market.  My skin type is neutral, not too pink or golden. Easy to use! Provides great color Let me start by giving you my stats;  I am 5'5"" tall and  I wear a size 8 in women's clothing.  This gives you an idea of how big I am.  Some of the reviews I read stated that one Tan Towel wasn't enough to completely cover an entire person.  They stated that multiple towels were necessary.  This is what I found to be true in my case even though I am  an average size woman.  In my case, I tend to have drier than average skin which may have play a part in why I needed to use 3 towels to effectively cover my entire body.Here are the Pros and Cons of the Tan Towels as I see them.PROS:1.  Application is easy.  Simply shower before application being sure to exfoliate (shave your legs, and any other part of your body).  Use a washcloth, or other item to remove dead skin from the parts of the body where you plan to apply the sunless tanner. Allow your skin to dry and do not apply any lotions or baby oil before using the Tan towels. Allow the sunless tanning fluid to dry completely before dressing.  I find it best to do this before bed and wear a loose fitting garment to bed. DO NOT shower or get wet for at least 12 hours after application!2.  The Tan Towels have a pleasant smell unlike any other sunless tanning product I've used (and I've used MANY)3.  You do not HAVE to wear gloves when applying as long as you wash your hands afterward.  Many sunless tanning products require gloves to keep from having orange hands even after washing hands.4. The overall color is natural looking opposed to that of many other sunless tanners.CONS:1. Each towel does NOT have equal amounts of sunless tanning liquid in them.  Some are nearly dry when opened while others have a lot of fluid. This makes it difficult to apply an even ""coat"" to the body.  This results in an uneven  sunless tan which is hard to see until the color develops.2. It easily comes off when you sweat.  This is serious issue when you live in the South where temperatures stay in the upper 90's all summer.  I find it ends up in the creases of my elbows and the backs of my knees in particular. Once it is wiped off, I find I have areas of white skin showing through in those areas.3.  Something about the product makes it turn an ""orange-ish"" color after swimming in a chlorinated pool.I hope this review helps .i The towelettes gave my legs, arms and face a light tan look. I am fair to medium skinned and tan easily in the sun.The towelettes did NOT make me look orange in any way, but I strongly recommend washing your hands AND fingernails with soap and water after applying. It lasts all day and night and even after showering, I could see a bit of color, but when I used my exfoliating scrub it washed off completely.They have a mild scent, as do all tanners, but nothing unbearable and it did dissipate quickly."
43,B0017SWIU4,"This is going to be a long review since I love this product so my apologies in advance. I hope it helps someone.Advance Warning - Both of these products have isopropyl alcohol which is *extremely* drying. It works but its possible to end up with irritation like I did. After about 4 days I ended up with a slightly itchy rash. There was no redness but a bunch of tiny bumps. It reminded of contact dermatitis. Fortunately my breakout was done by then. If it happens, don't freak out. Stop using the product for now. It will go away and it can be covered up by makeup without irritating the skin (be sure to use non-irritating makeup.) It can take up to 2 weeks ago. Mine did. The skin may have a slightly rougher texture for a couple more weeks after that. Exfolation can help. You will be able to use the product again in the future but use it sparingly and only on the areas needed. I think what caused it for me was putting it over the whole area of blemishes and being lazy instead of exactly where the spots were. It might seem like an unpleasant side effect but I really needed to get rid of the breakout that just kept multiplying. It was worth it to me as I think it was my fault for not being more careful. It isn't guaranteed to happen to you but if it does I wanted to share my experience. It will be ok I promise.I bought and use this in conjuction with the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion so I left the same review on both. I use them together based on another reviewer's suggestion so I can't rate them separately. That being said, oh my god this totally works. I was seriously blown away. I got a very unpleasant hormonal breakout of papules (blind pimples) on my chin during lady time and whenever I get them they take forever to go away because the infection is so far below the surface. To make matters worse anytime one went away another would show up. I had about 4 in the same spot and they were very painful. I really didn't want to spend that much on a product but the breakout had been there for weeks with no improvement from anything else I used and I was getting desperate. Below is a product description and how I used them.Buffering lotion - This product you can shake before application. Its a very thin, white liquid that's rated by Badescu as being better for Cystic AcneDrying lotion  - DO NOT SHAKE. A lot of people have been making comments about how the product settles. Its supposed to and the directions clearly say do not shake it and to use a cotton swab to dip it in the ""pink sediment"" then apply. This product is rated as being better for whiteheads.For my routine I waited until the evening and cleaned my face then applied the buffering lotion to the blemishes with my fingers as the instructions said to do. I waited about a minute until that dried and then used a cotton swab to apply a bit of the drying lotion. I used the products for 5 days just to be sure but I could have stopped at 4. I now have NO blemishes anymore and I'm just working on getting rid of the pigmentation marks. Those I can deal with. I'm extremely happy with this products performance and I highly, highly recommend it.Here is a bit on the different types of blemishes because it can be confusing trying to figure out what you have (Correct me if I'm wrong. Its based on my own personal research.)Whitehead - Standard, unremarkable. Not inflamed. Just looks like a small spot of pus. Goes away quicklyBlackhead - Open pore with oxidation causing it to look dark. Not inflamed. (These two products aren't designed for blackheads so I don't think it'd work on those.)Pustule - Inflamed whitehead. Infection at the surface but there's a lot of angry redness around the blemishPapule - Inflamed whitehead. Infection deep below the surface. Aka blind pimple. Its a closed comedone where the infection can't reach the surface. These can last weeks. They are hard to the touch and painful.Cystic Acne - Large, inflamed acne. It is one of the more severe types. It will feel soft the touch and be large in size. Rupture can cause spreading of the infection and lead to more outbreaks.Nodular Cystic Acne - The same as cystic acne but the infection is deeper under the skin and will be hard and painful the touch. Will not rupture but will not go away as Papules eventually do.The two types of Cystic Acne will likely need to be treated by a professional if severe. I'm not sure how these two products would work on small, minor Cystic Acne but its worth a try. Based on some of the other reviews this does work if its not very severe and all over the face.Note - Before you panic like I did and think your Papules are Nodular Cystic Acne, there is a difference and its size. Physically they feel the same but Papules are 1cm or less where as the Nodular acne is 1-5cm.Hope this helps! I used to have the “Eradi-Kate” by Kate Somerville and it lasted me forever but is kind of expensive, so I got this as a cheaper alternative. Well, I’m pretty sure it’s cheaper just because there’s not as much in it as the Eradi-Kate. It works! But I’m running out a lot faster, so I think I’ll just get the Eradi-Kate next time I need a new one. I have really nice skin. It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.Here's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is ""Black don't crack"". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.I hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases! Anytime you buy something, Amazon will make a donation to a charity of your choice. I'm donating to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society!!!!! When l first tried this product it dried and cleared up a blemish or start of one over night. Now hardly at all. It took over a week applying several times daily for blemhishes to clear. I still love how great it conceals and covers while healing. And no peeling. And the fact that it does eventually clear skin. My daughter had a double pimple action happening on the tip of her nose (very painful).  Decided to try this - it won't do an overnight miracle BUT within a day and a half it looked a lot less swollen, less red and dried out.  Glad I got it. I really appreciate the quality of Mario's products,  we got this set for my teenage daughter for the occasional breakout & especially for Prom so there is no need to worry about a blemish , she loves it Clears up pimples overnight :) I suggest covering it with a bandage if you can So I do have sensitive skin and rosacea. However this stuff works great you put it right on your spot at night. And it’s gone in the morning. It is a drying lotion so it’s a little dry in that area but it goes away throughout the day"
44,B000SASZ9K,"This product actually does what it claims--which is a rare find among the cosmetic products I've tried.  I've only been using this for about two weeks but I've already noticed a difference in the appearance of some Very Fine Lines in the corners of my forehead.  I also have noticed that I'm not getting the fine little red bumps/small acne on my forehead since using this.  While I don't know how well this would work on deep lines and wrinkles, I'm definitely pleased I saw these results so quickly.I should note that I had been using this twice a day since day one, entirely because I had been using other AHA and/or BHA products over several years.  As it recommends only using this once a day for the first week or so, it is entirely possible I saw results so quickly because I was using twice as much during that same time frame.  I still think the results are amazing and I'd still honestly recommend this to anyone who has a problem with fine lines and wrinkles.I should also note that I had some slight stinging when using this product for the first couple of days, in spite of my having used other  AHA and/or BHA products.  In addition, I had a little peeling on my face for the first two days, mostly in the corners of my forehead where I had been applying the most of this cream.  Still, this is now one of three things I use on my cleaned face before I apply makeup or go to bed at night.After trying MANY things over MANY years, this and two other items are now staying in my routine and for which I have given 5-star reviews. The other two are:1. ****UpdateI have used this product for a month now, I am running out of my first container. I have noticed contained acne control and significant reduction in my finest wrinkles. I think this is a good product to use for starting out, but should certainly be paired with a good sunscreen (I live in the desert and can *feel* that if I am out in the sun at all I will burn while using this without a sunscreen). I plan to order the 10% next and see if that does more; I will report back and if not, continue using the 5% until I am older.I sort of felt like this was an impulse buy, but I am so glad I bought it! I have been using other prescription acne products (retin-A and a topical antibiotic) for several years, but I am going through a very prolonged and stressful time in my life and they just stopped working at all. Plus my insurance doesn't coverage these products and they were getting expensive as well as pointless. I was having terrible break-outs and becoming neurotic about anti-aging skin care as my 30th birthday draws near. It was both pimples and alot of cystic acne (the deeper, swelling bump kind).So, this product and other reviews said it helped with fine lines, fading scars, and ""problem skin."" I figured what the h***, I have all three but have never tried glycolic acid, so why not. I chose the lower concentration simply because with all the other products I have been using and some important public occasions coming up, I did not want to risk a bad reaction.I put this on as per the directions (""for the first four weeks: apply at night and leave on for one minute, then add a night cream"") and the NEXT MORNING virtually ALL of my cystic was GONE and my other acne was really cleared up!! I never IMAGINED such an instant response, I was hoping for something by the end of the month! And I have never had any remedy whatsoever, prescription, home, OTC, do anything much for my cystic acne.It has been approximately a week now. I realize this is too soon to report on the effects the cream might have on my acne scars and fine lines, but I wanted to leave this review now because I have just had such an amazing and incomparable success with this product as a cystic and other acne treatment, I thought other customers might be interested. I will update this review in a few weeks regarding other product uses. This product is a GODSEND for my hormonal acne! This is my second jar of glycolic acid, and I feel like it’s been long enough now that I can write a solid review.After having my daughter, my skin was suddenly a wreck. I was getting deep, painful cysts along my jawline, along with smaller surface acne on my cheeks. Overall I was a mess, and no makeup could cover it! I was so unhappy with the texture of my skin I turned to amazon, and came across this skin cream. I bought this, along with hyaluronic acid from Tree of Life (also on amazon, check it out!). The combination of these two products COMPLETELY transformed my skin.I started out just using the glycolic acid once a day, but quickly bumped it up to twice a day (morning and night) once my skin adjusted. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and do feel a bit of a sting, but to me that means it’s working! The 5% to me is perfect, I don’t know that I would venture out to the 10%. This is strong enough to cause a bit of peeling, but not bad enough to cause burns (you can burn yourself if you aren’t careful/apply too strong of an acid too quickly! Please build up your tolerance!!). This is my first experience with any kind of acid, and I highly recommend to anyone experiencing hormonal acne. My skin tone has evened out so much, I can’t believe it. A lot of scarring has faded, and my skin is incredibly smooth. If I do break out, it’s much smaller/heals way faster than before.Side note: sometimes I do notice that I’m beginning to peel a lot around the corners of my mouth/nose. When this happens, I’ll skip a day of applying this cream and only use my hyaluronic acid to let my skin have a break. Use your good judgement as this is an acid. If you go slow and steady, and stick to your routine, this can make all the difference."
45,B0000632EN,"I have sensitive skin, and it is hard to find something that works on my face. After reading all the positive reviews, I decided on trying this product. OMG!!! love it, no breakout, it makes my face feels soft and smooth. Definitely going to make this my to go scrub. I use this every morning. It is not overly abrasive but it really helps to get rid of the dead skin cells. I I been using this a week now.. having blackheads problem and accumulating often. Using Aveeno stopped getting more.. I needed a new face wash.  This is a good product. This is a great scrub. Not too gritty & I have sensitive---red spots etc. I usually am shy about using scrubs but my face feels really soft & I'm liking it!!! This product is so gentle yet effective, can't get enough Desde que lo eh empezado a usar me preguntan que si me hecho botox o algo más por que se ve una piel limpia y resplandeciente. This is amazing product it cleanse your face and glows and also it’s good for sensitive skin."
46,B000WUD83E,"I've used this for years for a personal need and have never had a problem. We were using African Black Soap by the block (raw soap) and love that stuff. However, I decided to try a liquid soap, mainly because it seems easier for my little one.I first purchased the Shea Moisture brand on a whim while shopping at GNC (which I think gave me the thought to even try a liquid when I saw it)....and while I love every other item of that product line that I've tried, I did not like that one! It's not that it's a bad soap (and it does smells really good!) but it seemed nothing like the black soap we had been using. The raw black soap actually makes you kinda itchy while it's on you in the shower....and I know that sounds really weird and a reason not to want to use black soap...but I promise you that it doesn't last long and is great for your skin!Anyway, the Shea Moisture product didn't do that for us and did not have the same results for washing my face as the other.My whole reason for blabbing about the other brand is that once I finished that bottle, I came across this and thought I would try a liquid one more time.We ended up loving it and haven't gone back to the block/bar soap.It lasts a long time for the whole family. It's got a slight itch factor to it when you let it sit for a while, which I like lol 👍My daughter seems to notice the itch more but it's not unbearable....she's 5, so anything too itchy makes for a good dramatic episode...but she uses it and the best part is that, like the raw block/bar soap, it's GREAT for her eczema! There are very few things we can use on her skin, in fact we couldn't use the Shea Moisture brand on her because it would aggravate her eczema. We also use as a shampoo for her, she has really coarse hair so even though it has Shea in it, she still needs additional conditioner.It works great as a facial cleanser for me. I have very sensitive skin on my face, so like my daughter's eczema issue, I can only use select products. I follow up with a little lavender oil, peppermint and tea tree oil...and then a moisturizer like shea or coconut oil.My face and rest of my body also get dry easily so when I first tried black soap and got that ""itchy"" feeling I thought it would cause problems but I moisturize as normal and had no problems and have also seen improvement.As you can see, I'm a set fan and will continue to buy! I've been using this product for a week, but I already know I'm going to be a lifetime consumer of Dr. Woods Black Soap. I originally purchased this to use as a facial cleanser, but started to also use it as a body wash, shampoo, and in the tub.Let's start with the facial cleanser aspect - all I gotta say is HALLELUJAH! I've used so many different cleansers and facial products, and none of them ever did what I wanted them to do. I've tried so many different products to get rid of these little bumps on my face (in addition to the pimples); I've even tried ProActiv. All that other stuff just dried out my face and never ended up helping. Plus, I needed to use make-up remover wipes to get rid of the make-up before using ProActiv. The biggest observation I made was that even after using the make-up remover wipes and first step of ProActiv, make-up would STILL come off when I used the astringent. That other stuff obviously wasn't cleaning my face. But the black soap? It's the only thing I need to use to clean my face. I use a witch hazel toner after washing my face with the black soap, and nothing ends up on the cotton ball after applying the toner, so I know my face is CLEAN. You know the acronym KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid - this is the epitome of simple.Now on to the body wash aspect - again, a home-run. One thing I've noticed and wasn't expecting was that my underarms are smoother after starting this product. Sorry if this is TMI, but no more irritation from shaving my underarms. I used to get the red bumps, but now it's smooth. Again, it doesn't try out my skin - just makes it feel clean and smooth.The shampoo - I've only used it once as a shampoo, but I definitely noticed more volume. The one thing with using it as a shampoo is that I felt like I had to use a lot to get it to lather. Without a good lather, it was difficult for me to tell which parts of my hair actually had soap on it and which parts didn't. But hey, that's a minor issue. As others have mentioned, this product does tend to be ""runny"" compared to other soaps, but I'm cool with it.The soak for the tub - I guess you'd only use it as a soak if you like the smell, and I do like the smell. As others have noted, it's a unique smell and I can't really think of anything with which I can compare it. It smells clean and isn't overpowering by any means...it's just different.I would highly recommend that you at least try Dr. Woods Black Soap. I originally wanted to try this for two reasons - first, to get rid of the bumps on my face, and second, to try something made of natural ingredients. Boy oh boy, I'm never going back to lab-created chemical concoctions. This is the real deal. You can read every ingredient on the label. I am so thankful to have found this product!"
47,B00027DDOQ,"I have come to the realization that what worked for me when I was younger doesn’t necessarily work for me anymore.  I have written in previous reviews about I had really bad acne in my teens and twenties until I discovered benzoyl peroxide.  I used products with 10% benzoyl peroxide for many years and although it helped me immensely as a youngster, it’s too much now that I’m in my 60’s.That’s where Clean and Clear comes in.  It’s absolutely my go to now.  It’s clear, it’s got a wonderful scent, it goes on smoothly and it’s got my new favorite-salicylic acid (2%).  It’s gentle and doesn’t dry my skin, which is what benzoyl peroxide does to me now, unfortunately.I love all the Clean and Clear products for all the reasons mentioned above-easy on, absorbs well, great smell, etc.  Wonderful products, and I will be buying this again! Love how fast it works but it does dry area if you are not careful. Use to get it at Target but couldn’t find it so had to order it online This product It's amazing I've tried All kinds of products over the past 2 weeks to try to get the red bumps on my nose to go away with absolutely no luck. It happens everytime I eat something sugary. I used 3 times only between yesterday afternoon and this morning . And the results are astonishing. Have been using this for a decade and its amazing. My face is flawless because of this product. Never have breakouts. Have given to others and when they have breakouts, they are usually gone very quickly. Recommend it! I'm on my second order and I think it's a great value as well. Clears up tiny sebaceous cysts.With it was more affordable, though. This works great for spot treatment! This is one of the best acne medications I've ever used and I'm old"
48,B0000AJ3PU,"For almost $10 for only 12 oz. of lotion, I expected a lot better scent.  The only reason I bought such an expensive lotion was because I have a sore on my arm called ""pityriasis rosea"" and it was recommended I specifically buy Aveeno brand to help it heal faster (takes almost 3 months to heal).  The sore does look a little less red after 2 days, but I put it on my face as well as it feels very greasy (another reason to remove a star).  However, I also put it on my arms where there are no sores, and my skin does feel soft. I love the scent of lavender but am very disappointed that the lavender scent disappears in about 5 minutes.  Although it seems to already be helping my sore and my skin is soft, I would not buy this again for non-medical reasons because the scent is so weak and the price so high.  With that said, however, I am very glad it is helping my sore so I would recommend it for that and if you have the money to spend, it is a nice, non-scented lotion. I used this lotion for years then I switched to another brand,  unfortunately the price went up and they changed the formula on this other brand,  so I have started using Aveeno again and I couldn't be happier.  I have very sensitive skin and this lotion doesn't make me itch, it absorbs into my skin right away with no sticky or oily feelings.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft. I truly love the way Aveeno gets the job done. It has a faint scent, but it's not too much I love this lotion especially with the body wash. It is calming and relaxing. Looks just like pictured, smells amazing. Doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy. Also is a steal of a price for the lotion and the body wash together. I definitely recommend!!! Very quick and efficient shipping I will definitely order again. A We've used so many different lotions. This is the best one we've tried. It's very moisturizing. You don't have to keep applying it. It makes your skin so soft. I always use Aveeno products to keep my body soft.  Wanting to ask also why I keep getting messages that my account is having a problem?? relaxing smell, like it even more than cetaphil smells amazing, light weight and it’s jsit so good in general After years of looking for a lotion I think find right one. It soft lotion make skin feel smooth."
49,B000ZMBSPE,"*Disclaimer = This is not an advertisement of any kind but it is a more extensive review than most.Ok all of you with #SkinIssues ~ #Acne, #discoloration, #agespots, #wrinkles, #pores, #scarsI know how hard it is for some of us and how expensive some of the ""solutions"" out there are, so I'm going to share something with you that you're going to thank me for.I've battled #SevereAcne my whole life. I think I've tried everything that is out on the market. I even took something called Acutane in highschool that was so powerful that I remember each pill being individually wrapped with a No Symbol over a picture of a pregnant lady.Out of frustration I began researching and trying almost every skin product that is in the market and compiling reviews from multiple sources. After some trial and error I've found something that is almost magic.I now have a routine of four things that has erased all acne, discoloration and smoothed my wrinkles & scars in two weeks.Here it is:First the facial cleaner (which I believe can be substituted with anyones favorite but I've found this one to work the best for me):1. #Avene Cleansing Foamhttp://www.amazon.com/Avene-Cleansing-Foam-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B00BGCX63O?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s002. #MarioBadescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater (Amazon will try to get you to buy the ""add on"" which is only a dollar less but half the oz, so look at the size options.) I put this on after washing as well as use it to set my makeup. It is amazing.http://www.amazon.com/Mario-Badescu-Facial-Spray-Rosewater/dp/B00172O9NO?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s003. #LevenRose Organic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Natural Jojoba Oil, 4 oz (This and the Facial Spray are the most important parts of this. This product is incredible. You can also use it as a makeup remover, its great for hair as well as stretch marks and cellulite ((yes, I'm telling you the truth.) It also lasts a couple of months.http://www.amazon.com/Leven-Rose-Organic-Pressed-Unrefined/dp/B00GJX58PE?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s004. #AztecSecrets: Indian Healing Bentonite Clay (The larger oz is also only a couple of dollars more and will last you a couple of years.)http://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secrets-Indian-Healing-Bentonite/dp/B00N528HIC?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00I wash my face, then its important to let your face dry. Then the spray (let dry) and finally the Jojoba oil. I also use the spray and oil after the mask, which heals and seals your pores.Since I've been using this routine, my skin looks luminous and almost 10 years younger. I'm not joking. I've bought the most expensive products on the market and none of them compare to these which are a 1/10th of the cost.Let me know if any of you try it. I'm not selling any of these or making any money or anything for telling you all this. I'm just so incredibly pleased and surprised that I couldn't not tell people. I remember the first time I tried a mask with this stuff it was like magic the way it tightens on your skin. I could really feel this working on first use. I later purchased another brand from Rite-Aid and it was completely different. . I only use this from now own. I love this clay because it works with water, tea, and oils that I use for my hair and skin. This clay works great for 4C natural hair to cleanse and soften your hair strands. If you use a lot of products on your hair, it will help to clear your scalp without stripping your oils. The clay is not very moisturizing but mix well with moisturizing products. For anyone with sensitive skin that wants a deep cleansing clay that doesn't cause breakouts while it's detoxing your face, this Aztec Indian Healing Clay is the best. Another positive about this clay is that if you purchase the 2lb, it lasts for a long time, so totally worth the price point for the results you get. I LOVE THIS STUFF!! You need to get your face acclimated to it though. I make my mask more on the watery side, so it dries faster. I wouldn't leave this stuff on my face longer than the instruction say. It literally sucks the moisture out - but it's making a TON of progress on the pores on my nose. Make sure you follow with a GOOD face moisturizer. Am I disappointed?? Absolutely No, this is my second jar. Use on my face, underarm and hair and scalp :) it’s kind of a miracle in a jar Make sure this what u want I love this product, it lasts a long time and its verstile. I use it on my face for breakouts, i soak in the bathtub when im sick! Its just so great! Been using for yearssssss i have real bad acne & i really love this mask. If your consistent you’ll see results."
50,B0018ZMU04,"but now my face really hurts! I've been using the 15% TCA peel by another vendor for over a month, and I thought I ""outgrew it"" (need to leave it on for about 5-7 minutes twice a week to see any effect). So I bought the 30% glycolic peel from Skin Obsession. Holey moley, does it sting! Just applied it after a shower and left it on for exactly 3 minutes, then I rinsed for about 5 minutes with cool water combined with baking soda. True to the instructions that came with the package, my face still stings and it's been about 35 minutes since I rinsed it.For others out there who think it's all water and no acid--mine is VERY watery, but there is most definitely acid in the mix. The consistency is not a good indicator of the acid to water ratio (in chem class, the acids tended to be a little more viscous).I'll update after my skin starts shedding.**Update 7/29/2013**It's been a week since I last applied this product, and I honestly haven't seen a difference in my skin tone, nor have I seen a difference in the color/size of my age spots. The initial ""burn"" wore off after about one hour and, based on the instructions that came with the product, that is to be expected. Since I live in a very humid climate and exfoliate every day, I did not see signs of shedding, dry skin, etc. I will continue to use this product in conjunction with my TCA 15% peel and post another update regarding the effects on my melasma.**Update 8/27/2013**I've applied this product three times since my last review, and it still burns like heck each time--burns to the extent that I think I remove the acid before it can really do its work. However, this product (in conjunction with the mild TCA/Salicylic acid peel I use on alternate weeks) seems to have lightened my age spots a bit. The spots are still there, but the cover more easily with my drugstore (cheap) foundation--plus, no new spots! In other words, I intend to continue my acid peels + assiduous application of SPF until I see the spots worsen. Please do your own research, there's a lot to learn about this process. Here are some things I've learned.This particular brand and percentage was recommended in different websites and videos I watched. I think 30% was a great starting point for me and for others who have never done a chemical peel at home.I found a great tutorial for applying the peel and I watched several videos on youtube. I watched a professional perform the process and that was really helpful in understanding how to apply it. I also watched other home videos and those were helpful in understanding what to expect.Advice that I found most helpful:-start by leaving the solution on 1-2min, counting from the time that you make the first stroke.-put vaseline on your eyes, eyebrows, lips, and nostrils.-start with your forehead and go around the outer edges of your face towards the center.-add a couple of ice cubes to the baking soda solution so that it will be extra cold, when you neutralize the acid with the baking soda it will create a reaction that releases heat on your face and the ice will help that. It will not be too cold for your face, it will help.-most doctors seem to suggest a total of 8 peels: 6 light peels every 2-3 weeks, then 2 more peels with a month in between. But apparently you can continue to do this monthly after that.-if you start with thin and short peels you might not have to experience your skin actually peeling or coming off in big flakes. (this is what I did, I didn't want to walk around flaking all the time, so far, day 2, no flaking)-after washing it all off, you can put coconut oil while your face is still wet to lock in the moisture-do a hydrating facemark after your peel-moisturize several times and at different times after your peel. I completed it around 4pm and moisturized like 5-6 times after that. My skin was very grateful.Other good to know information:-the worst burns seemed to have happened because people wanted a ""quick fix"", and they left the solution on their face up until the point when it was burning and not tingling, that's a terrible idea. Start with just a little time and build your tolerance.-if you do happen to burn your face then it seems like you will be ok no matter how bad it may look, as long as you put a LOT of sunscreen on it. If it's really bad go to the doctor and get a special antibacterial cream for your face so that it doesn't get infected.-take your time and understand how to do it correctly, set everything up before you start, don't take shortcuts or you will cry of how horrible the peeling will be (just look up peelings gone wrong)-your skin is very absorbent at this point, make sure you are using natural moisturizers so that your skin will be the healthiest possible-don't use retinol or other products with acid, citric acid, AHA, or DHA, or whatever other acids, it will just irritate you and possibly hurt youMy experience:I watched a few videos right before and set everything up to get ready. I let the alcohol air dry. I put the acid on a little shot glass, like many places recommended. I started my timer, then worked on putting the acid on with the gauze that it came with, it took about a minute to apply. I dipped a q-tip in the acid and put a thin layer closer to my eyes. I watch the timer until 2 minutes, then I placed the soaked baking soda washcloth on my face. It burned more than the acid, but I was already expecting it because that's what I had read. That only lasted for a few seconds and then I just splashed the baking soda mixture right on my face for about a min. Then I washed my face with cold water. At this point my face was feeling hot, but it didn't really burn. For the rest of the day and even today (day 2) I feel my face hot, like a sunburn. Apparently this is normal and it's the skin having been irritated. I put on a lot of sunscreen today (2 different times), and I can tell you that when the sun hit my face, it made it immediately tender. I stayed outside for maybe like 10 minutes with my hand over my forehead to create shade, but even with sunscreen I think I burned my nose a little bit. So seriously, be very careful with the sun! I was able to put make-up without a problem this morning. I felt like I saw some results right away. My skin feels smoother and brighter, but I know it typically takes a week for it to be completely healed. I've read some people do a peel just a week after the first one. I don't know if it's too much on the skin, I know that 30% glycolic acid is not TOO TOO strong, so I might try to do it. I haven't decided yet. I took pictures, but I have to wait a few more days for the final results. Will update after I take those pictures and I'll post them.This is the link for the tutorial. [...] Bought this because I have melasma secondary to birth control pills. I was honestly scared pretty bad by some youtube videos of people who had them done (by a professional) and things went terribly wrong. Then I read the reviews of this product and was not completely convinced this was a good idea. I have now done this peel 3 times. First time I left it on for 4 mins, got great results. Didn't notice any ""flaking"" but the second time I left it on for 6 mins and definitely noticed some flaking around the more sensitive areas on my face. Just did the thrid treatment this morning and already my face looks smoother, minus the little pink tinge. So here are my pointers:1. Obviously, follow the directions. They come on printed paper with the acid.  Don't leave it on for more than 3-4 minutes the first time. Honestly, would you rather have no results or permanent burns? Start slow, your skin is different from everyone else. This is a real chemical so be careful.2. I liked using a brush the best for application. I just use a cheap art store one.3. It didn't burn bad for me at all. Again, your skin is probable different from mine. I would imagine that if it is burning more than you can stand, you might want to listen to your skin and wash it off, quick.4. Make sure you have baking soda, use plenty and splash your face for more than the recommended 1 minute. Use plenty of moisturizer afterward. Some people like to skip this in order to get the ""flaking"" over with faster, but your skin will have less wrinkles in the end:)So as far as fixing my melasma, it has worked fairly well. I stopped taking the pill, and that plus the peels has faded my dark spots about 30%. I expect it to continue fading, i might trying a different kind of acid or buy a stronger glycolic. I will definitely stick with the brand Skin Obsession, they seem to have the real stuff."
51,B001GBF0A2,"Thus is soap and it cleans well.  I have really sensitive skin and this soap works as it should.  Smells good and doesn't leave a sticky residue. I have sensitive, oily skin. I started using this to wash my face, and it is great! Plus, it lasts a long time. Super affordable option! Will buy again. Other soaps made my whole family itch w/ their fake toxic lab chemicals for color & stink (call it what it is, its clearly not coming from nature).  This soap is superb, luscious lather, creamy, super clean and WOW no bad itching or rashes! Neighbors recommended it as this is a growing troubling issue w/ all of these nasty lab chemicals that don't occur in nature.  Super Soap : ) Love it's for sensitive skin. Smells good too. Dove Sensitive, is the only soap that my sensitive skin can tolerate.  I stock up on it via Amazon,  due to great price points. This is the best soap for sensitive skin. It doesn't have any added scent, so won't irritate like soaps with fragrance. Cleans and moisturizes. This bar soap is bought in tandem with the liquid version.  Works well for ezcematic skin I’ve been using this product for years and Amazon offers it at a great price."
52,B00195MZUI,"Over time Triderma really does remove red blotches on my face. I am only 21 years old, and I have unfortunately watched my skin deteriorate from 'porcelain-doll' to pale, red, and flaky.  Around my nose I have developed broken capillaries which look terrible -- it has made the sides of my nose VERY red and flaky, and I have been very self-conscious about it since it started.  I have NOT been to a dermatologist to get an actual 'diagnoses' of having Rosacea, but I am pretty sure considering the appearance it is something of that nature.  I have tried Clinique's redness solutions, Dermalogica's intensive moisture balance moisturizers, Dermalogica micro-exfoliate face wash, tea-tree oil, lavender oil, vitamin E oil, coconut oil, so many different things, but I have come to find out that if you are not treating your skin for the specific issue then you will not see results.  I have now changed my facial cleansing routine to this:-I use Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser morning & night as a face wash-Apply TriDerma Facial Redness Repair cream, then 10 minutes later apply TriDerma Intense Fast Healing creamAfter just two days, I have noticed a remarkable change in the texture of my skin.  My skin is no longer flaky and patchy, but is now smooth, even, and glowing.  The redness on my cheek area close to my eyes and nose has pretty much disappeared, and the redness on the sides of my nose has greatly improved because of the texture and moisture improvement.  Granted, the redness has not gone away completely, this would be an unrealistic expectation because the product says it heals over time.  I have clearly damaged my skin from the over-application of make-up, harsh face-washes, diet, and other environmental factors, so it is important for people to remember that first-use miracles or 'overnight transformations' are probably not going to happen.  I am hoping that after a solid month of consistent use and maintaining the routine of use then I will see major results and my skin will continue to heal.I think this product, along with TriDerma intense fast healing, has greatly improved the overall look of my skin.  Even though I still have slight redness around my nose, I can see the improvement after every use and cannot wait to see how it looks after using for a few weeks.  Wonderful product(s)! I have had pretty bad rosacea for about 10 years.  I have tried everything under the sun that claims to be a remedy, but this product is honestly the only thing that has ever helped me.  If I am in an acute flare, my face feels like it has been sunburned and these flares usually continue through the night.  I have tried cooling my face to stop the flares with everything from cool compresses to witchhazel to ice and nothing stops them, except this product.  The very first time I tried it, it stopped the flare immediately.  Occasionally if it is a bad night (especially in the winter)  I might have another flare break through, but I just apply a little more of the TriDerma and it is stopped again.  I usually develop an acne like rash from the rosacea and this product usually clears it up within a couple of days. The redness is toned down within about a day.  It's a little on the thick side, but it is so soothing and not greasy at all.  I used to only use it when a flare happens, but now I try to remember to use it a few times a week and it seems to prevent new ones.  If you suffer from rosacea like I do, please give this a try. I have had horrifically bright red skin for most of my adult life. The pigment is inherited from my Father who I also inherited my red hair and delicate completion from. The older i got the redder my skin became. I was starting to look like a walking beet, having to pile what seemed like thousands of pounds of makeup on every day just to cover it and barely succeeding. So in desperation i bought this product. I've been using it for three months and I am finally noticing a difference in my skin. The redness is stilm there, and its still noticeable, but now i don't have to put on quite as much makeup to cover the redness. Now instead of piling on six different layers of concealer under my foundation, all i need is a little concealer on my monthly pimples; and a light application of foundation on top and i look like a human being instead of a bright red root vegetable.It seems to be working quite well. I am hoping the redness will go away completely so I will keep trying this product until it does. :) Admittedly at first I didn't really like this.  I bought it thinking it would diminish a broken capillary, and when it didn't really do that, I got frustrated.  However, one day I had some dry skin on my forehead and I just grabbed the cream and put it on my face.  I looked in the mirror a couple of hours later and noticed that my skin looked really nice.  It seemed kind of glowing and my general redness was gone leaving a more even tone.  This is when I started liking the cream for a different reason.  It makes my skin smooth like a rose petal, velvety and soft.  I can wear it under makeup without any greasy effect.  It does combat redness and dry skin, but the claim to fixing broken capillaries is not quite as true.  I think it makes makeup look more even, kind of like a primer, which is a good thing.  It smells kinda weird and reminded me of burn cream, but you really don't smell it on you and it doesn't leave anything oily on your face or hands.  For the price, you can't beat it.  Basically I have very sensitive skin, so for this to have a positive impact and not break me out or anything, it's pretty good."
53,B000VF5WVG,"I really love this product. This is my favourite thing from Premier. All you do is smear a layer of it on your face and wipe it off with a towel. It removes all dirt and makeup from you face. The reason I know this works is because I use a cotton ball saturated with toner afterward and the cotton ball reveals to be cleaner than when I was my face with water. The person that said it doesn't feel clean, obviously didn't check to see if her skin actually was clean.The real reason I love this is because it only takes like 2 minutes and I don't have to use water. I hate washing my face before bed, usually I just skip the whole thing. If I wear eye makeup, I'll just rinse my eyes with water, but not actually wash my face. I know it's not good to sleep with makeup on and that it ages the skin, but I just hate it. I'm glad I found something so simple and easy to solve my problem. If I could, I would buy a life time supply of this so I'll never have to be without. Here's a product that actually seems to smooth my skin, although I am still confused over whether I'm using it correctly or not.  The instructions (albeit faint and difficult to read) say to massage the milk cleanser over a washed face, then wipe off the excess.  I always rinsed off cleansers before, so if this is supposed to be a ""cleanser"" than why am I leaving the residue on my face?  At any rate, the milk cleanser does seem to smooth out my facial skin texture so putting on subsequent moisturizer and light tint goes on smoothly.  The jury is still out on whether or not I really, really like it.  There are so many other products out there that do better at less cost. I received this the day after ordering. I know the price may seem expensive but the bottle lasts a long time because you only need a small amount. I use a cloth and water to wash my face first. Then I use a small amount of this cleanser on my whole face and neck. I wipe it off with a tissue. My skin feels so soft. I use this cleanser every morning and night before I use my moisturizers. All other cleansers seem to dry out my skin. So worth the price! I've been searching to find this cleanser!  So happy I was able to find on Amazon!  The scent is so clean and fresh and really makes my face feel sooo nice!  Excellent product!! Love All Deap Sea products.Cleans my face instantly and feels very soft I love the richness and the fragrance of this product.  Makes my skin feel so smooth.It’s pricey but a little goes a long way. I have been using Premier Dead Sea products on and off for the past 3 years and it rivals many of the top moisturizers in the business. I love the creamy texture of the cream and when you apply it to your skin you can instantly feel it hydrating. Due to economic struggles I have had to use other store brand names to clean my face, which resulted in my face being dry, dull, and lackluster. Since using the creams, toner, and moisturizers for the past 15 days many people have complemented that they have seen a glow in my face.  I was very surprised to find the product in Amazon and at a reasonable price. At my local mall this cream along with the other products was $30.00 each! I am so glad and fortunate that I can now buy and enjoy high quality affordable face creams here at Amazon. I love this milk cleanser I use this one every nightI’m 37 so I had started to really notice a difference in my skin like a lot of Dryness and  from that my skin was aging 👎I started using this a little over I month ago and it has changed that , my skin is more hydrated and very healthy looking !!! I’m so pleased with this product in addition I use the toner and there mico bead cleanser in the morning !!!"
54,B0014UAHQW,"I got curious about essential oils on my hunt for a solution to my dry, curly hair. I heard some talk about Rose Hip Seed Oil and how it can work well in thin hair because it doesnt coat the hair it absorbs and holds in moisture. With furthur research I learned that this oil contains vitamin A which helps assist with cell regeneration, delay the effects of skin aging, and promotes collagen and elastin levels to increase. The results are smoother, firmer and more youthful skin. There is also a high amount of essential fatty acid acids and Vitamin E which further promotes heathy skin. It is supposedly successful in treating stretch marks, psoriasis, eczema, hyper-pigmentation, uv damage, wrinkles, scars from surgery, acne and burns, dermatitis, age spots, burns, age spots, brittle nails and dry, damaged hair.Because it is a dry oil, it will soak into the skin easily and not leave a greasy residue, but dont use too much. It spreads very easily so you only need a little bit and it will last a long time. Even though you can use it un-diluted on your hair or skin you can also add it to creams, lotions, moisturizers, conditioners ect. It is not recommended for use on sever acne or on very oily skin.My first time using Rose Hip Seed Oil I added a few drops to a combination of Suave Moisturizing Almond and Shea Butter Conditioner and Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine 3 minute Deep Conditioner, then I combed evenly through my hair and left in for about 15 minutes before rinsing out. That day I did notice an increased softness and less frizz, although no extra shine like I was hoping for. I have natural curly hair thats shoulder length and pretty fine, although I have alot of hair and it is dry and can get frizzy. On my hair Id rate this oil at about a 3 but there are many other great uses for it.So far I've applied this oil using a cotton swab to my nails twice a day for about a week and the results are phenomenal. I've always had crap nails and cuticles that I had a habit of biting that I just couldnt get over. Every once in a while I'd stop, and they'd grow (some of them) but they'd always have an ugly color and break because they were so weak, so eventually I'd start biting them again because I hated them anyways. A little while ago I found I no longer had the need to bite them (thank god) but still have the same problem, also they get weird bumps and ridges and some of them grow uneven. But ever since I started with this oil my nails have not only grown (if you can see results in only a week, you know it's working) but they are already looking healthier, feel stronger and I haven't broken a nail since starting and thats a record for me. It has also already started to heal my cuticles and suprisingly a cut on my hand that I experimented with a dab of the oil, cool. Although even more suprising, I tried this on a razor bumps and over night they were gone.I would like to try this on my acne scars, as I have yet to find a product that will get rid of them, but am worried as my skin is semi oily and I still tend to break out from time to time. Last thing I want to do is make my skin worse, right? But I do plan on experimenting with it and Tee Tree Oil, which I've used with success on the occassional break out (and many more uses) and possibly a facial cream and add to my review at a later time. I'm 31 and have battled acne forever it seems.  I stopped purchasing ""commercial"" skin care products as they all made my skin worse. A few years ago i researched and tested many natural products. Some worked and some didn't. I've found using certain self blended oils on my face is much better than any ""face cream/moisturizers"" on the market. This product has worked miracles.  I mix half rose hip oil and half almond oil in a glass apothecary bottle and.....wow! My previous face attempts left me with horrible cystic acne and many white heads. The rose hip oil acts as an exfoliater without irritation and sweet almond oil as moisturizer/anti aging. I combine both 50-50 and apply a small amount to face after washing with dial basic bar soap. I scrub skin with soap and a hand powered soft face scrub brush. Soap and brush bought from dollar tree, then i apply my mixture and steam my face twice a week to loosen clogged pores. My face is almost clear! Almond oil absorbs quickly and leaves a my skin nourished while the rose hip helps my skin exfoliate and rid it of dead skin cells that lead to clogged pores with no irritation!! I've tried every carrier oil out there. Many times spending $400 on so called miracle products. This is by far the best combination and so much cheaper. I am honestly amazed! If you have problem skin 50-50 is perfect. If you are not as oily then i would start with 25-75;75 almond. I use a dab of just the almond under eyes for its anti aging abilities. I never leave reviews but i feel as i finally found the perfect products and routine. None of it is scented, i believe fragrances irritate my skin. My skin appears more youthful and break outs are at a minimum(pcos and hormone imbalance will never make my face perfect but this routine is by far the best my face has ever looked!)  you must try the routine and i highly trust the companies qualities.Here is a breakdown of my new found miracle routine:1Wash face twice daily with dial basics soap bar and very soft bristle face scrub brush2 apply above mentioned combo after each wash3Dab of almond oil under eyes for anti aging4 steam face twice a week for 15 minutes right before wash/scrubThat's it! And when i put on makeup i use 2 squirts of seaweed pore minimizer from the body shop and blend it with a smalll drop of. Cliniuqe(sp?) foundation, rub between hands and apply like a lotion. Gives great coverage and doesn't feel caked on. Feels natural and matte quickly!!!-Stop spending so much money and see if this works for you!! I couldn't be Any happier!!!* this review is. 100% honest. I'm in love! Even my dermatologist is amazed."
55,B000NPWQU4,"This is an awesome moisturizing lotion while also giving you that healthy glow. I saw darker skin overnight and my skin feels very moisturized. Doesn't streak and color can be buildable the more you use it. Love! I love this L'oreal moisturizer, use it all the time, but I also got a package addressed to someone else! Please pick it up. Works so much better in just one application. Love I’ve been using Jergens for a few months now and the color is super subtle (too subtle for me) so I decided to give this one a try. After just two uses I noticed a deeper color, deeper than anything Jergens was able to get to. However, in the sunlight I can see a slight glittery sheen on my skin, which I don’t like. The lotion itself is kind of thick and sticky, and takes a while to dry. The smell is ok, not great, but not as bad as other tanning products.I keep comparing to Jergens since these lotions have the same end use - so in a side by side comparison:Color: L’Oréal definitely leaves a stronger tan. However, I don’t like the glittery sheen.Lotion: Jergens feels nicer on the skin and isn’t as sticky.Smell: Jergens definitely smells better and doesn’t have that fake tan chemical scent. This has a nice very light scent. The color is nice, not too dark or unnatural looking. I have tried others and like this the best! Love the slight color.  I have tried Jergen’s but it’s color looks off on me.  L’Oreal’s is just right for my complexion. this is just as other reviewsers say you dont think youre gonna ee any color but i used this two nights in a row i was stark white now i look sunkissed! mostly on my legs is where i put it and now my legs are twice as dark as my arms! my arms always get a little sun but wintr has been so long my legs never got any sun but now it looks as though ive been laying on the beach! and to make it all you can just take your time use any thin regular body lotion first so it wont look splotchy you can get any kind at dollar ttee! wait for skin lotion to completely dry and not feel tacky but not so log as ur dry again! then when you apply i shook my tube up real good cause it seemed runny at first so i recappd it an shook it up when i applied i just slathered it all ovr my legs and kept rubbing gently in circles til my legs were all covred and the product was in my skin real good! dont know how you dress but i dont go bare so i just put on sleep shorts real high up on my legs like bootie shorts walked around forgot about it for about hour really didnt see anything so i went on to bed boy when i woke up it was like the tan fairy visited me! yesss! so i did same procedure lotion and all AFTER a quick shower and after the second day when i woke up it was on!!! i had a beautiful tan not splotchy even though i am a woman of a certain age have varicose veins etc thiss stuff made me look and feel beautidul! sooo its better than jergens cause it does not streak and really didnt affect my knees or ankles thats why use body lotion first! good luck hope you enjoy this as mych as me i plan to put it on auto order thru summer! This is the best daily moisturizer I’ve tried with a tanning tint. The color is very subtle so not a major tan—just a little glow. I use this on the days I don’t use a stronger self-tanner. Kind of to supplement it.  I just use it on my legs and feet. Pretty easy to apply. Goes on smoothly."
56,B000NWGCZ2,"Living with rosacea for about 35 years but lately my skin was greasy and acne prone so I researched and then purchased different moisturizers: One that was $55 and one that was $45. After about a week of each, my skin was worse in a different way. It was dried out and rashy. I Googled and ended up here with Vanicream that cost about $15 for a “vat” of it. Unbelievably amazing! I applied three times the first day. It is a heavy cream, but my skin just soaked it up. Two days later, my red rashy face has cooled down and calmed down considerably. I am impressed! I also purchased the cleaner and I don’t feel like that is as impressive. I think this cream is what turned things around for me. I am very grateful for that! I very rarely write reviews- but this product is a holy grail for eczema and parents with children struggling with eczema need to know about this.My baby has struggled with dry skin since birth. By the time she was three months old, her skin was no longer just dry. She was suffering with eczema and it would get worse by the day until eventually it was severe. It was from head to toe, bright red sandpaper. I took her to her doctor and she recommended frequent baths without soap (about every other day) and then to slather her in aquaphor. Now, the frequent soap-less baths did seem to help. The aquaphor also helped a little bit, however it was temporary relief and I had to slather her multiple times a day. The aquaphor was worn off by the next diaper change, and sometimes I didn’t really notice a difference in her skin at all. The results were minimal at best. I did this for weeks without any noticeable results.So, I started doing some research and came across Vanicream products. I purchased this lotion and the healing ointment. Figured I’d give it a go since I had read good things and the aquaphor wasn’t cutting it. I can’t speak to the baby formulated lotion- I didn’t know it existed until I had already purchased this one. However, the ingredients in this are gentle and safe for baby, so I really see no issue using this as opposed to the baby formulation.MY DAUGHTER’S SKIN CLEARED IN ONE DAY. She went from SEVERE eczema to NOTHING by the next day. I was in absolute shock. I had given her a bath, slathered on the lotion and topped off with the ointment from head to toe, and by the next day it was all gone. Completely. It’s been about a week since then and I have been applying the lotion daily and the ointment on areas that seem to be getting a bit dry. She has not had one eczema patch since. Do yourself a favor and buy this and the ointment if you or your child suffer from eczema. Highly, highly recommended. Reviews around the web saying that this was ""a bit greasy"" made me wary but I decided to try it anyway. I wanted to find something similar to the CeraVe cream that I use on my body but can't use on my face.  This has no scent and feels very ""clean"" on my skin,This is thicker than CeraVe but it absorbs really fast. I actually feel that this is not oily enough, but I am able to use it on my ace without as much irritation. I'm beginning to think that body creams in general will not work on my face! This will be my nighttime body cream and I will keep using CeraVe's night cream for my face. I love the price and I really like having a pump. I've always loved CeraVe body cream, and I still do, but this one has a little bit more substance. My skin has been extra dry this winter, so my dermatologist recommended this VaniCream and gave me a couple samples. I couldn't order it fast enough! It feels greasy when you first put it on which had me worried, but somehow it absorbs instantly. It's also unscented which is better for your skin. I haven't have a single break out, and it kept my skin hydrated until my next shower.He also gave me samples of the face wash and it's really nice, too. I'll be ordering that when my current face wash runs out. I've tried a couple different face moisturizers including Korean skin care brands but I am so happy I decided to give this one a try. The ingredients list is simple but the effect is immediate. Very moisturizing without feeling super greasy. You'll definitely have a glow but a healthy one. I purchased primarily to use in the night but I'm finding myself reaching for it during the day as well. A couple of my kids have eczema enough that they need a prescription (mild) steroid ointment for flare ups.  When we use vanicream regularly, we can minimize the the amount of steroid ointment we have to use.  Vanicream makes a huge difference in keeping their eczema under control.  I'll be buying this forever. Just about every skincare product under the sun burns my face off, including the well-adored Cerave and Cetaphil. Anything with regular sunscreen in it burns as well. I have extremely dry and sensitive skin as a result of having a particularly pronounced case of rosacea. I usually have a list of ingredients that I try to avoid. When looking for a moisturizer, none of them were without one of those ingredients, including Vanicream. So, I decided to take a chance and start narrowing down through trial and error. I was a little skepticle but hopeful as I needed a moisturizer for my face relatively quickly. I tried this one out this morning and initially there was a subtle burning on my face. (My face was also slightly more red, which happens after I wash my face anyway) however, by now (about 3 in the afternoon) it no longer burns, my skin feels relatively well moisturized, and the extra redness is gone. Suffice to say that I'll be using this one until it's empty and then I'll decide if I want to continue using it.Now for some logistical concerns:1. The cream is very thick and heavy at first. However, after about 7 hours I don't really notice it anymore and I don't know how long it took for it to not feel heavy as I was preoccupied with an exam.2. The pump ain't pumping. It takes several pumps to get just a tiny amount out of the jar (if you could call it that).Then to sum up my other concerns:1. It burns a little at first and then feels normal after an hour or so.2. Makes my rosacea slightly more pronounced for a bit, but after a few hours she calmed down.3. She's thicc and takes a while to fully absorb"
57,B000MXHG7A,"I’ve been using two products from Reviva and do not miss a night of using it ... The 10%  glycolic acid and a Dmae lifting cream.The glycolic acid sloughs away dead skin cells and also you can feel it tighting the skin, once dry put thin layer of DMAE lifting cream on in an upward motion from neck to face. This photo was taken a few months apart.I can promise you, if you use this every night you will see a huge difference ! BTW photo was take at the age of 50! I’m 52 and my neck looks the same.. I did run out and didn't use for about a month and it started to sag so I make sure I never run out again ..** Make sure to use good sunblock and wear a hat when out in the sun.. Your skin will be more  vulnerable to sun damage because you were sloughing away the dead skin cells. I keep a big brim hat in my car and put it on every time I get out of the car... Smooth texture and gives me the results I'm looking for as stated on the container. Product is used as a day creme, not night.  It keeps my skin hydrated through out the day, without having to add another product. I’ll be using on face and neck for first time tonight. I tried some on my hands when it arrived and it felt a little waxy for the first fifteen minutes until my skin soaked it up. Typically DMAE with Elastin causes dryness (to tighten skin and moisturize) so it will be interesting to see how well this product goes up against “BioCell” by South beach labs, a product that does work but is completely out of range for the average person by price. The latter product I used for thirty days and became so dry I had to return it. So as a less expensive product, I thought I’d give this a try, as its very economical and has basically the same ingredients (DMAE and Elastin). I may or may not add a hydrolonic acid treatment to this night cream regimen after I see a few weeks of results. I will update in a couple of weeks to finish out my review. I have high hopes!TBC... Really good moisterizer, thicker cream, nice absorption. My skin felt nice, smoother and nicer texture when applied. I only used one jar so no huge difference yet. I think this is a really good moisterizer and with the added DMAE it has a tightening affect. To me, nothing but retinol ( anything containing retinoids, there's a few forms)  is going to reduce or lessen the appearance or depth of lines and wrinkles. This is a good moisterizer but I don't think it will rid you of any major lines. Still I do like the moisturizing effect and feeling it left on my skin. Added with other products, I see this as a good addition, when used with retinol products.All in all I like the Reviva products. Finding the right one for you, that's the tricky part. Great stu6 First two ingredients are water and aloe vera gel, but feels very oily ..........  Used this a few years ago and remember it being a lot lighter. Pills on your face as it dries.  Guess I'll be using this as a body lotion. I really like this moisturizer.  I had been using Shiseido for decades but they decided to create a new formula that was supposed to be an improvement.  I have very dry skin  and did not like the new formula so I went on a hunt for a new moisturizer.  I tried every moisturizer I could find and nothing was as good as what I had been using.  I purchased Elastin & DMAE night cream, not really expecting  much, but I am very pleased with the product.  It feels rich and my skin feels moisturized throughout the night (and day, since I use it in the morning too).  I would recommend this cream to anyone with dry skin."
58,B000NCTQV4,"I love this salt scrub!Be careful when you rinse as the floor of your shower can get slippery but my skin loves the feel and smell.. it feels very hydrated afterwards Before I go into the negatives, I do really like this scrub and I bought it because it’s fragrance free and has good skin ingredients. With that there are a lot of negatives but I don’t mind them honestly. The formula is incredibly oily and even though the scrub is made up of coarse salt, the grains separate super easily and doesn’t give a great exfoliation because of that. I will continue to use it but its definitely not your average tree hut scrub experience. nice and smells great, and a bang for your buck, however it’s VERY oily and liquidy. You for sure need to be careful when picking up the product from the jar because it will spill. Otherwise it’s a nice product and filled to the brim. It came with no lid? Thankfully, it was sealed. I do Love this product I love how soft it makes my skin feel. I highly recommend this product! It’s worth the purchase! So the buyer is aware, if you're hoping for something along the line of tree hut this is not your jam. It's oil with coarse ground salt in it. It doesn't soften well, it actually cut my skin. The oil is nice for pre-shave but I had to use massive amounts of soap to get it off I usually love Alba Botanica products, but this one was a bit disappointing. The grains of this scrub are too big and they don't exfoliate much. The scent is nice and lemony, but I think I'll go back to making my own scrub at home. I have been using this for the past 2-3 months and I honestly would recommend this for dry skin types. It is really oily!My skin is olive color and I have dry patches of skin as well as bumps on my arms from those ingrown hairs. I figured that I need to exfoliate more and I use this after product after using ""Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub"".Pros:•I really love the large sized salts, they really do feel great on my skin.•I like the oil in this product as it makes my more hydrated but I don't feel oily and greasy afterwards. I use a towel to dry after my shower.•The amount in this jar should last you at least 1-2 months showering everyday and using this product all over.Cons:•I do not really care for the smell of this product. It is a little overwhelming and kind of reminds me of canned pineapple scent. It doesn't smell GROSS it just is a little overwhelming is all. (It's not so bad that I wouldn't purchase this again though).•As much as I do like the oil in this product, I also dislike it. I wish it was just a tad bit less oily.•I do not really like the consistency of this product. I feel like I am shoveling rocks out of water when I get some out of the jar. There is not really a gel like consistency to it to hold the sea salt together.Overall, I do like this product and would purchase it again. I am still deciding if it is really worth almost $10 though."
59,B0014TDE5E,"Great soap! I use it Also to wash my veggies and fruits too! You never get a bathtub ring with this Great soap,and its THe best for children,And pets! This Miracle II soap is so good for many things.  It is great for washing my hair and also great for washing pets.  Just dilute it with some water.  It is also great for making a spray to kill pests like spiders and bugs (you dilute it in water for this also). Been using this product for many years Best product for so much relief. love to have these products on hand.  Good for burns. This is a wonderful  soap that I have used for years for multiple applications. It is made to be diluted with water to whatever strength desired, so it lasts a long time. I use it as a shampoo and body soap in the shower, and for general cleaning. It leaves my skin very soft. It is also great for washing my car, as it leaves any metal or enamel surface very shiny. When I rub it on my arms or legs, it is a more effective insect repellent than most of the harsh, toxic chemicals that are sold for that purpose. This product is all natural and no harsh chemicals like the general cleaners people use for their bathrooms or kitchens or for general use.It is antimicrobial and smells pleasant and a great cleaner. Does anyone know why the consistency and scent is different, and which one is the real product? As you could see from the pictures I’ve added. One is darker green and of thicker consistency with a noticeable scent. The other is lighter green color and doesn’t have a thick consistency not a noticeable scent, seems more watered down. Which one is the real miracle soap? Also is this seller a reputable seller of the product? I’ve ordered many times over the years from Amazon buying the 22oz and gallon sizes of all their products. I do love the products. I use them on my whole body and I use daily all their products. I use the miracle gel and moisturizer on face and on my hair instead of gel. It is the best stuff I’ve found. Keeps shape and soft. Never any flaking. I also use it when I want a face peel. I leave soap on face for about 30-60 minutes. Over the following week face will slowly peel. Depending on skin type you may have to repeat until it peels.  Be careful on sensitive areas like around nose lips and eyes. If it don’t work at first. Repeat.  My face always peels. It’s a slow peel. I usually just ad more to problem areas , Age spots and such. They slowly get better over time and the more peel you do. Try and do during winter season. I like better then stronger peels. Cause it’s does thinner layers at a time and doesn’t ruin skin. I also use this for cleaning kitchen bathroom cars. Pretty much everything. I also use for shaving my face. Never clogs razors. Very smooth. Never leaves soap scum. Don’t have to clean showers as much. This is the only product in my shower. There are many more uses. Would love to get more details from others that are reviewing on Amazon"
60,B001DJDP7C,"My skin looks very smooth, no break-outs, zero wrinkles, etc. since I've used this product for over a year now. Love it and wouldn't change.  At night I use a small amount of face scrub, rinse, then more of the toner. I used to get professional facial. With  this product don't need them. Love it! And I'm a Grandmother with very smooth skin---I think from this product and nightly face scrub--that's all I do. My family has been using Thayers Witch Hazel for years to reduce inflammation from acne or injuries anywhere on our skin, including in sensitive areas. Without alcohol in the toner, it doesn't overdry. The aloe also doesn't leave a sticky residue. We like that Thayers uses high purity and quality ingredients without unnecessary additives. Thayers is gentle enough to use every day to avert issues and to help heal problems. I like the refeshing cucumber scented toner and my husband, who has very sensitive skin, prefers unscented. I had been using the rose Thayers toner for about a year when I decided I should try the lavender. Although I like the scent of rose better, the lavender has actually cleared up my face and calmed my skin more. So glad I decided to switch. Just use a couple of cotton pads with this after washing your face and just look at how much dirt and makeup that the face washed missed! This is an important step to my face care and I use it everyday! I highly recommend and it smells good too This product is good for sensitive skin. It does not over dry the face. And the scent is very mild which I love. I’m not the kind to be able to handle such strong fragrances. I rarely write reviews but this definitely deserves one!  Wish I have used this for years. Have been using it for like a week so far and my face is 100% smoother. Feels clean (and is!). Wow! Highly recommend!  You won’t be disappointed! I have particularly sensitive and acne prone skin and this toner used after the cerve moisturizing face wash has cleared my skin up more then any other products. I have been making my teenage boys use it and have seen their skin improving as well. Very happy with this product. I love this product. but it is an amazing facial toner, I 've been using Thayers Original Witchazel Facial Toner for the last three days this is an absolute lifesaver. I have sensitive, acne-prone combination skin. My acne has reduced in size and this product isnt drying like other acne products or toners. My skin feels very hydrated after. Amazing! Ive only had it for a couple of days and already see a difference in my skin's texture and redness level use it every night before bed. It helps clear my skin and remove any excess oils and makeup after I cleanse my face. I also have put it in a travel-size container and carry it around with me and if I feel my skin is getting greasy I just put some onto a cotton pad and wipe my face and it leaves me feeling fresh and clean. It does smell like roses when you squeeze it out of the bottle but I haven't noticed my skin smelling like roses and it hasn't made me sneeze or make my eyes water after use."
61,B00014EKJC,"I have been using this bar for many years. I can’t recommend it highly enough as it is way above 5 stars. It is very good for sensitive skin anywhere on the body. Special thanks to S. Ise for contacting the company and obtaining the ingredients list. I consolidated it below for quick reference.Ingredients: Vegetable (Tapioca) Starch, Vegetable Glycerin, Vegetable Oils (Sunflower, Jojoba, Olive and/or Safflower), Potassium Sulfate, Potassium Phosphate, Purified Water, Bentonite, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Natural Essential Oil (Lemon), Iron Oxide, Lactic Acid (Non-Milk), Citric Acid, Allantoin, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)BodyThis cleansing bar works well as a body soap, my skin feels clean and doesn’t feel dry. I keep a bar in the shower and one by the sink to use as hand soap.The normal pH of skin is between 4.5 and 6.2.  And normal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5. Water has a neutral pH of 7, anything below is acidic and anything above is alkaline. Our skin is naturally acidic, but most soap bars have pH levels of 9 or 10, which are too alkaline for the skin. I love that this soap has the same pH of skin and doesn't dry out skin like alkaline soap bars do.HairFor the longest time, I used diluted liquid castile soap as shampoo and then rinsed with diluted vinegar as a conditioner. It was a bit of pain having to mix the vinegar rinse every time I showered, but I didn’t mind and did it for years.After using this cleansing bar to wash my body, I decided one day to try this cleansing bar on my hair after remembering a friend telling me about using shampoo bars. My hair was so soft afterwards, I couldn’t believe it. No conditioner needed because of its low pH. And it made so much sense since the pH of hair is between 4.5 and 5.5.FaceI was hesitant to try this bar on my face at first, I wasn’t sure how it would react. But after the first time, I was sold. I’ve only washed my face with this bar ever since (it’s been over 6 months now).I’m bad about washing my face; I do it about every 2 or 3 days. When I wet my face to prepare for washing, I can feel the rough/bumpiness of dead skin on my forehead. After lathering on this soap once or twice, my face feels very smooth. It feels like it’s sloughed away all the dead skin cells. I don’t even use toner afterwards, just a vitamin C serum and moisturizer. And I think my skin looks pretty good.TravelI usually don’t like the shampoos and soaps offered by hotels, so prefer to bring my own. I bought a travel soap holder from Amazon (ASIN: B075D32CG3). I let the soap dry on the plastic rack before storing it back in the soap box.Likes:- pH of 4.5- can be used on face, body, and hair- replaces shampoo, body wash, face wash, hand wash- easy to travel with- fresh lemon scentDislikes:- not fully transparent about ingredients (apparently due to manufacturer and not company)Summary: I no longer buy face wash or shampoo because I just use this bar soap for everything. Absolutely, hands down, the best soap to clean the sensitive skin on the face.  It works well on all other parts of the body, including hair, but it is a bit too expensive to wash those, so I keep it strictly for the face.  I have been using this soap for at least 15 years and I have only praise for it.  I will never go back to any other kind of soap, unless they discontinue this one, of course. The only soap I ever use for my face. Suds up good and fast. Awesome Lemon scent. Lasts a long time. I'd like to post the ingredients that I was given in response to my emailing the company. This is what they said: ""Dear Valued Customer,The Natural Beauty Cleansing Bar is one of our oldest products. We started buying it from a natural soap manufacturing company nearly 40 years ago.  They have avoided telling us all of the ingredients based on the US regulatory exemption of soaps from full disclosure in the Food, Drugs and Cosmetics Act.Nevertheless, we believe we have been able to work out everything, but the natural fragrances.Here is the most complete list I have. I hope you find it helpful.Ingredients and Descriptions:Vegetable (Tapioca) Starch ? Vegetable starch is an all-natural thickener providing a smooth, clean texture.Vegetable Glycerin ? A major component of cleansing bars, glycerin is a natural moisturizer.Vegetable Oils (sunflower, jojoba, Olive and/or Safflower) ? Vegetable oils form natural cleansers and help skin retain moisture.Potassium Sulfate & Phosphate ? (These ionic minerals react with vegetable oils, a process called saponification, to impart strong cleansing properties.)Purified Water ? Water is 100% purified with the most advanced filtration system available.Bentonite ? This natural mineral clay forms a natural cleansing buffer that also helps ensure uniform pH.Cocamidopropyl Betaine ? Made from coconut oil and betaine, this natural surfactant offers unparalleled cleansing activity.Natural Essential Oil (Lemon) ? Fragrance is a blend of natural essential oils extracted from lemon fruit.Iron Oxide ? A natural part of the buffering system iron oxide is an electron acceptor which neutralizes the alkaline pH of other ingredients.Lactic Acid (Non-Milk) ? Derived from lactobacilli fermentation of starches, this natural acid helps lower pH.Citric Acid ? Nature?s strongest and most ubiquitous acid, citric acid helps lower pH.Allantoin ? Allantoin is a natural moisturizer, skin protectant, conditioner and rejuvenator.D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E) ? Vitamin E is added for its antioxidant and preservative activities"" I've been using this for years without ever provides review. I swear by it for my face & now ny teenagers are using it and it's keeping the acne at bay. Love this. I use for face, body & hair."
62,B000ORV3NC,"I bought Weleda Skin Food for my husband after he was given a prescription cream from his Dermatologist to remove some pre-cancerous lesions on his face. The prescription cream basically creates a chemical burn on the skin (very nasty one at that) and the Dermatologist had him using Vaseline (petrolatum) on it twice a day over the cream after washing with a gentle cleanser. He had to use the prescription for two weeks and after the first week I had him add Weleda Skin Food under the Vaseline (based on all the wonderful reviews, I figured it was worth a shot). His skin was at a point that it wasn't super raw after the two weeks and he did a skin patch test to make sure he wasn't allergic to any ingredients on his forearm before adding it to his new routine. My husband hates using skincare products (hence the pre-cancerous skin lesions) but he loooooved using the Skin Food under the Vaseline. He said the Vaseline felt great, but the combo of the Skin Food and Vaseline felt wonderful. My husband got to the point that he looked forward to washing his face so he could put them both on again (he did reapply the Vaseline throughout the day if his skin felt dry or irritated). He loved how soothing the Skin Food was to his skin and how fast his skin was healing.After three weeks (2nd week of treatment and two weeks post treatment) his skin never looked better. I know the wonders of Vaseline, but the Skin Food ramped it up so many notches! His skin is seriously amazingly soft and radiant!  I am going to buy my own tube to see if I can get a bit of that glow for myself!I would have added pics, but he didn't want me to and I wasn't going to do it without his consent since we did take quite a few before, during, and after his skin treatment. If you're reading this, please wear sunscreen! I don't want anyone to go through what he did (and his was ""just"" pre-cancer) or go through worse. There are plenty of great sunscreens out there and self tanner, if you feel you want your skin to appear tan, but I bet you look just as fantastic with the skin you were born with :) Normally, in the store, I don't know if I've EVER spent $11 on lotion or an ultra-rich cream like this but, that being said, I wanted to try it.  I just got it last night and tried it about 10 mins ago.  As one person said it's thick but it is moistening and seems really good for dry skin.  Before this I had never heard of Weleda Skin Food and some reviewers said Julia Roberts liked it.  Well, pretty woman shops a lot so she does know some things!  LOL  And the smell is quite lovely as my friend in England used to say when I lived in Europe!  I thought I could hear that song that says...Girl you got that yummy, yummy,...."" play when I smelled it!  Seriously, it feels good on the skin and I would buy it again; wish it were a bigger one as it's 1.0 fl ozs and yeah, on sale would be nice too!  Just sayin....  :) It does the trick, but it’s hard to get outa the tube if it’s in the car and cold overnight. No big deal, ID buy it again, works for my dry cuticles and skin. I have sensitive skin ( seems like I’m allergic to my watch’s wristband now!) but this works without any problem. Smell is mildly herbaceous, I don't mind it. It is VERY moisturizing, but tends to leave a bit of a greasy film on my skin for a few hours. It has helped me through winter, which I appreciate, but it hasn't changed my life. It's also way THICKER than any other lotion I have ever used on my face, but I don't mind. I have no idea how I forgot the stuff existed but it came up on suggested for me a while ago. Absolutely awesome I love the citrusy smell the heavy moisture but non-greasy feel and the Dewey look that it gives my super winter weathered skin up here way up north. Absolutely awesome under make up prior to sunscreen and just plain air after washing my face at night. Love it I enjoy the scent and feeling of this lotion though I dont know that its worth the price. I didnt realize they had it in Wholefoods, I would have just grabbed it from there than waste on boxes etc. Ultimately it's nice but I prefer something more cost effective for regular use. I purchased this because I read an AOL news ad featuring it as a product actress Julia Roberts loves. It was a genuine ad. The price was great, so I gave it a try. It actually is very very good and you truly only need a dab. It moisturizes older skin and has a pleasant natural scent. I only use it on my face.  After it quickly absorbs, it is not greasy. It is well worth trying. If you don't care for it, another friend or family member will love it. I really like this product for the aged skin on my hands and neck.  It doesn’t take long to see positive results."
63,B001E76B0G,"love the product Apparently Thayers has stopped offering the taller plastic bottles of this product.  It doesn't make much difference to me, witch hazel will always be something I keep on hand.  Its great to moisten a q-tip and clean inside the folds of the ears, especially kids!  It has a natural, fresh lavender scent which is not overwhelming, and much more energizing in my opinion than the scent free, although both varieties work the same.  The cucumber scent is another favorite of mine, so I often switch each time I order. Mostly I use it on a cotton cosmetic pad to clean my face each morning. I also use a few drops of witch hazel to mix into jars of moisturizers that begin to get thick from opening and closing the lids each day.  Several drops or more, then mix around, and the consistency will lighten up and spread easier.  Lastly, if you have some natural ingredient body lotion left over in a bottle, or pump bottle which is hard to get out, pour enough witch hazel in to shake and blend a very light lotion. which makes it easier to use up as it will pour out of the bottle and you won't waste what is normally left over. I love witch hazel as a toner… this deal was amazing and when I need more I surly will be buying from this vendor again. The scent isn’t too heavy but very nice. I have sensitive skin so it’s always imperative I find a good product that won’t break me out. First time ordering the lavender scent and I love it. I believe this product is one of the main reasons my acne has practically disappeared. I dealt with painful cystic acne for 2 years before I found this product, and this has help not only keep my face from hurting, but it kept me from breaking out and heal much faster. It is also not like other toners that immediately dry your face out. My face actually feels moisturized after using it! I used to use the Clinique toners, but they were so drying that they were actually making my acne worse because my skin was over producing oil to compensate for all the moisture loss (and yes, I was following up with multiple moisturizers). This stuff feels (and smells!) so nice. Seriously, you will not regret buy this!Some people have complained about not getting ""authentic"" products by this brand off Amazon, but from what I can tell this specific order is authentic (it has the lot number on the bottom of each bottle). I've used both the Rose Petal and the Lavender Witch Hazel and I truly like them both. Neither scent is overpowering in its smell/aroma - which is really great if you're needing to use this on your face. Thayers Witch Hazel formula is so kind to my sensitive skin - and scalp. I have such extreme sensitivities with my skin and scalp - everything seems to affect them - even changes in tap water ('soft water' or no) that isn't filtered. I have been using Thayers for at least 5 years now, for my face and body. Then, one day, not long ago, just for the heck of it, I massaged a liberal amount of Witch Hazel onto my scalp and within a few minutes I felt measurable relief. By the next morning my scalp felt 'normal'. Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't a 'cure-all', but, for me, I find that it does help 'soothe' irritated and/or inflamed sensitive skin. Please bear in mind if you're considering whether to try this Witch Hazel formula, what works well for my sensitive skin, may not do the trick for you. But, fwiw, it might be a reasonable 'bet' to try it if you're plagued by 'suffering skin'. Per the wife: I love Thayers Alcohol-Free Toners, and this is no exception. I use it for my 53 year old mature skin to get rid of excess makeup or dirt after thoroughly washing. It does not dry out my skin and is gentle and wonderful.  There are no parabens or other harmful ingredients, and the price is unbelievable. My 17 year old daughter with acne-prone skn also uses this, and it does not cause break outs. We both love it.  She was using the proactiv toner before, but that is three times the price and has parabens - I do not want her using that anymore and this does the job better. I have used the Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner as well, and like both. The lavender scent on this is so faint that I really don't notice it. You can't go wrong with Thayers Alcohol-Free Toner. Highly recommended. I have been buying it for years. I love this toner!  I do feel as though the lavender helps with my acne.  I like that my skin does not feel dry after using it.  I can use this throughout the day for when my face is oily or feels dirty, and feel great afterwards.  So far, one 12 ounce bottle lasted me 2 months, which is great! I think this stuff is what a 'nice shave' means.  Put it on your face, pretty liberally, as it is unscented.  Then let it dry by itself.  It will soak into your skin and tighten it up for an awesome smooth face.But if you decide to go with this as an aftershave.  You are going to need a nice glass decanter for this.  A plastic bottle just isn't right, for me.  And I have figured out that a spray bottle is great for aftershave.  Just use it before you put your shirt on, so the over-spray will go onto your chest.  They sell a couple nice ones here a Amazon.I got an Old Spice bottle from ebay and a pump sprayer at the same time.  And the pump sprayer won my appreciation for best decanter."
64,B0019QU5P4,"I love this stuff, but be warned that this is not going to be a great sunscreen for everyone, which is why I knock this down to 4/5 instead of 5/5. It absorbs well (for me) but looks a lil greasy, even after letting it sit for a moment. It looks greasy, but it doesn't feel greasy, make of that what you will. I personally really like looking glowy without having sticky/moist feeling skin.Another thing: If you have darker skin, this might not be the best product for you :( (and tbh ppl with darker skin are probably already well aware of this possibility with all/most mineral sunscreens, but I just wanna confirm this does in fact leave a white cast) I am pale as snow, so the white cast this leaves on my skin almost works like a tinted SPF (lol).BUT, I believe Blue Lizard has a Sheer SPF that works a lot better for more melanated individuals.This stuff doesn't pill up, even when I use a thick moisturizer underneath it. It looks great when I put makeup on top of it. It stays on basically all day and doesn't budge, I actually have to work it a little to get it off my skin with my cleanser at the end of the day. I use this on my face and my body daily and it has never broken me out or stung my eyes and I have pretty darn sensitive skin. If you need a heavy-duty sunscreen (and again, you either don't mind a white cast or are pale) this stuff is very good!! If you have sensitive skin, and have tried hundreds of sunscreens, try this one. Every sunscreen I’ve ever tried has burned my eyes while wearing it, and while trying to wash it off, it’s burned my eyes even more. But not this one. This one was easy to apply, didn’t burn my eyes while wearing, and while removing it - still didn’t burn my eyes! I stopped wearing sunscreen for a long time because I’ve never been able to find one. But finally, I can stop having the sun damage my skin and I finally found one that works. Just buy it, and try it. In the past I always had a problem with getting sunscreen in my eyes when I workout or play Pickleball. No matter what I did the sunscreen and got in my eyes and was very irritating and painful. Blue Lizard sunscreen solves that problem. No matter how much I sweat, or whether I apply this sunscreen close to my eyes, there's no eye irritation. It's also provides great, long-lasting, protection from the sun. I've been using this product for over a year now and I plan to stick with it. Very happy with this product. I actually found out about this stuff when my sister bought a bottle and brought it home as this one was being shipped. 🙄I'm very fair skinned and burn easily. One might say I'm a vampire, though the sight of blood does not excite me. And because of this I'm either covered head to toe 365 a year or drowning myself in sunscreen.Many of them irritate my skin because as luck would have it, nature blessed me with being sensitive, too. To perfumes and whatever else they're putting in other sunscreen. I can maybe get away with putting some of it on my legs and arms, but never on my face. Anything perfume-y on my face and my eyes swell up and shut tight... I look like I'm turning into a fly, no thank you.I was using Shiseido Sunscreen at one time for all over, until I ran out. It worked very well and I never had an issue. Except it's rather costly and it's got a white cast to beat the band. Yeah. I'm talking full-on clown makeup. Still, no burns, no tan. Hallerlujah!So now I've got Blue Lizard. And it's got a white cast, but it's not terrible. It's also not permanent. It actually disappears after a few minutes - which kind of left me wondering if I was covered still. I checked... my skin is slick so sunscreen is still on me. If there's doubt, the gnats return to start annoying me with their presence.I spend upwards of 3 - 5 hours in the pool every day, unless it's storming. The first hour is walking around in the water vacuuming, so my hands are getting more water exposure than my face is. Rash guards from neck to ankle.Roughly 30 - 45 minutes later, the sunscreen that was on my hands is gone. I believe that the bottle says up to 60 minutes water-resistant (not waterproof! Any sunscreen that claims ""waterproof"" is being deceitful), and I know you're supposed to reapply every 80 for this SPF... but there should be something to let consumers know that water exposure will halve the protection time.Because I reapplied religiously, I never got any kind of sun burn or tan. Somehow my hands magically escaped with my reapplying while wet. But after you let the product dry a bit before you return to your activity, it should work fine.I also had zero irritation - EXCEPT when I went underwater after vacuuming and scooping out nature's little minions for over an hour.This product will run. It will get in your eyes. And it will burn. It doesn't matter if you applied it dry or with damp hands and then let your face dry. If you start sweating or your face gets wet at all and the water goes into your eyes, it's picking up product and taking it to your peepers! This happened so many times over the course of two weeks I thought I was going to lose both of my eyes. At first they just felt dry. But every day it got worse and worse.For this reason I have stopped using it on my face and have started using something else that doesn't run and cause irritation. My eyes were red as fire trucks for over a week, and I have been worshipping the makers of eye drops ever since.The lid changing color to let me know of the UV danger is nice. I don't know how scientifically accurate that is, but it's a good focal for me anyway.So, it's really great stuff as far as I'm concerned. I just know better where to put it now. I recently purchased the Australian Sunscreen mineral sunblock and overall, I am quite pleased with it. One thing to note is that it is not waterproof, only water resistant, so it's important to remember to reapply after swimming or sweating.One downside of this sunscreen is that it can be slightly greasy, which may not be ideal for those with oily skin. Additionally, it can sting the eyes if it gets into them, so be careful when applying around the face.One thing I really appreciated about this sunscreen is that it doesn't leave a white cast on my Asian skin, which is a common issue with many mineral sunscreens. It is also thick and creamy, which makes it easy to apply and spread evenly on the skin.Overall, I would recommend the Australian Sunscreen mineral sunblock for those who are looking for a water resistant, mineral sunscreen that is free of a white cast. Just be aware of its slightly greasy texture and potential to sting the eyes. I really liked this for several reasons:No toxic chemicals, white cast faded quickly, stayed on skin well, good protection"
65,B00006JT6O,"I read reviews all the time but never write any, but now I've decided to write because I appreciate the helpful reviews others have written that helped steer me in the right direction, so I want to give back and help others if I can. I've tried many products and for the most part have seen no difference in my skin. This includes many highly reviewed products. But this, along with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream Wash (which I also buy for a great price on Amazon too) are the only two things I can remember using that made a noticeable difference in my skin.So you know, I have rosacea, and had shiny, red, sometimes flushed and burning cheeks. I tried many things until I finally settled on this regimen and it has improved my skin greatly. It has more of a matte look instead of that shiny, red irritated look. I use the clarisonic Mia with the DELICATE brush. I ran out of it once and used the gentle brush that came with the Mia and saw and felt a definite difference. It was too rough on my skin and left it red and abused feeling. I use it with the Neutrogena product I mentioned in the first paragraph. (I was using the Neutrogena grapefruit wash before and that was NOT good. Left me very red.) Then I use this moisturizer. I used to use the same one in the daytime version, but that one would go on streaky and then crumble when I tried to wipe away the streaks. Also it looked kinda shiny and I didn't like the way my skin looked with it on. The night version has none of those problems. I wear it day or night and when I put it on in bed without a mirror, if I get up to go the bathroom or something, when I look in the mirror I see no streaks. That was not the case with the daytime version which I used to use at night. I woke up in the morning with all kinds of crazy streaks. Also, I love the smell and feel of it while it's going on. It feels a little cool which is just what my rosacea skin needs. You might not notice the cool feeling, but if you have rosacea then you definitely appreciate a cream that's cool rather than warm when going on. Also, it's hard to explain, but it makes my skin look really nice and glowing-like. Other reviewers have probably explained it better than me and all I can say is it's true!One more thing that I feel I should mention, though with many reservations and ""buts"", is the Tanda Luxe. I bought one around the same time I adopted this skin care routine. I think it has also made a difference in my skin as far as the shinyness from rosacea but it also leaves my skin pleasantly flushed when I finish using it which might not be a good thing for Rosacea, but I'm unsure. Another reservation I have in recommending this is that all the reviews that complain about its battery are completely true. I have to charge it after every two times I use it. And lately it's gotten even worse.Those of you reading this that have rosacea, you should know that the products I use have ingredients that are not recommended for people with rosacea, but it works for me and my moderate rosacea. It might not work for you, and I guess we all have to find what works for us and our type of rosacea. I hope I've been helpful and wish you all the best! I love how this cream feels. It is the perfect weight for me. It is light but creamy, and it is not greasy at all. I am weary of creams, but not this one. It soothed my skin and feels great.The best benefit for me: I'm very impressed this product addresses seven skin care issues. Most companies will sell you 10 products to get the benefit that you can get in two. I detest piling on layers of skin care products before I go to bed. I usually skip some when that is the case. It becomes a chore. So, if I can address all of these issues in one step - especially for this price - I found a new friend.I do have to say that I don't love the smell of this product. It isn't a strong smell - just a little bit odd. I only noticed it the first time I used the product, but if that is more important than addressing this many skin care issues by applying one product you won't like it very much. That is up to your personal preference.I am a former professional skin care consultant and make-up artist, and I know the market. I gotta tell ya - Olay has really stepped up their game, research and technology in the past few years. They used to be an okay but passe' company. Now they are hot on the trail again, making some notable and popular products. They are competing very well again in the market and have without any doubt many of the best products you can get for this price point. Good for them! Who said, older isn't better? :*) I have used this cream on and off for the past few months and have more or less enjoyed the effects of it. Originally, my chief concern was that I wanted to firm up the dark bags under my eyes and assist to preserve my skin starting early (I'm 24). I was delighted after the first few uses to discover that my cheeks did feel firmer and I felt pretty refreshed. However, my first few uses were spread out from each other.A few months later, I decided to start a normal regiment. After 3 nights in a row(maybe longer), I, and other people, started noticing that my skin was breaking out. I have never had skin problems or acne ever before in my life, and this was a pretty disconcerting reaction. I followed the directions and washed my face each time before bed and added a very very thin, rubbed-in, layer all over my face. I suppose having an oily/creamy microlayer over your skin all day can't be good for your pores. Who knows. Perhaps I should make a note to wash my face once I wake up each time. However, I will continue to use this product and see if the effects remain consistent.One other reviewer mentioned similar effects in their review.As for the smell, it's pretty mellow. I would prefer it to be gone personally, but it's not a terrible concern. Let me start off by saying that I've worn a heavy foundation every day for the past 15-20 years due to uneven skin tone, redness, blemishes, undereye circles, etc.... Now that I'm in my mid 30's I was looking for a heavier moisturizer because my skin has dried out a lot in the past year. I wanted to be able to go without any face makeup and feel confident about it. I've been using this for the past month and a half, and after the first couple days I saw improvement. I've been able to not wear any makeup and my skin looks healthy and has a glow to it. After the first month or so, I noticed it looked firmer and the fine lines I had developed around my eyes were gone. I am beyond happy with the results. My skin looks and feels heal their than it has ever been- even my pimples have disappeared.It has a very pleasant scent and I don't find it heavy or greasy- I often wear it during the day. I would reccomend this moisturizer to anyone!"
66,B000EGYRGS,"Was not effective at all. If you have flaky skin and am looking for an inexpensive way to remove it, this is what you want.  It's a bit messy so have a vacuum handy afterwards, but the results are great.  I'm using retinols and the flaking is a bit crazy, but if I use this twice a week or so, my skin looks like glass. Great value. Oh my God!!! This product is super amazing!!!! It makes my skin smooth and uniformly bright. The brown stains of my pimples/brown spots are fading out gradually and surprisingly a sagging of my cheeks is tightened up a little bit. (Maybe it's because of the alcohol in it?)I think I uses it too much (once a day, because it changes my skin so much!!!), never had any bad reactions so far. It has a pungent smell and sting my eyes but I really don't care!!!! I can tolerate anything for this dramatic changes!!!I've used soooo many expensive skin care cosmetics like $500 cream or $50 masks but no others has made my skin changed this much as this only $15 product!!!!!!I strongly recommend to try this for once. If it wasn't for you, you only waste one-meal money!I'm sure I will buy by a box for myself and my family whose in Japan!! It’s a great skin brightener! Love this product!  I had a professional chemical peel and I had to take two days off from work.  My face looked like I was tied to a car bumper and dragged down the road.  It was so painful, burning, peeling - never again.  A year later when I was starting to forget the agony, I purchased this from my neighborhood ""drug store"".  The price was over $20.  I use it on my face, my hands and my butt.  When I found this on Amazon for half the price I bought two.  I smear it on, shower with a wash cloth and then use a good moisturizer.  My old face feels fresh, my hands are pretty and my butt is smooth!  PS)  I have nothing to do with this company and hope they do not test on animals. Previous formula had a different texture and more recognizable natural ingredients. I am wondering if the company was sold to another entity. It still is helpful, but I liked previous formula better. Seller shipped and got it to me promptly. I've purchased this for the 3rd time in a row.  Great product that makes my skin look dewey and fresh and I'm 43! Will be a returning customer. I had to use this very sparingly to begin with and not every night until my skin had built up resistance.  It still tingles a little in pkaces, but I've come to like that as it feels like the active ingredients are working their magic.  My pores seem smaller,  my skin feels smoother and much prettier in complexion.  It also zaps any hormonal spots that try to break out. My go to night cream now.  Always super quick shipping too. Before you waste your money, read only the reviews from late 2018 to 2019. The Formula has been changed and the mixture arrives dried out and unusable. Out of the 4 jars I have recently ordered, only 1 is somewhat spreadable, the rest have shrunken to a mass that won't stick to skin. Please see photos of dried out jar and semi-spreadable jar.Also see the photo of ingredients on an old jar and the new jar. They look the same but they must have changed something. The clue is in the instructions. Whereas before the mixture needed to be kept on for 3-5 minutes to dry, the new jars say only 60 seconds. Whatever they added to make it quick-drying, has backfired big time.I am perfectly willing to wait 3-5 minutes to have a usable product. My old jar lasted two years and never dried out. When it ran out, I thought the dried out replacement was a one-off. Four jars later and reading other reviews seems this is now the norm. A total and unacceptable waste of money. I have a hard time understanding how Reviva haven't figured this out yet and are still selling a dud to unsuspecting customers."
67,B0002DTV0K,"I am a 53 year old male and I have tried many products to deal with damage done by retinol and pre-mature aging to the skin area under my eyes and crows feet. I have tried phytocerimides, vitimen C serum, instanatural eye gel, and hydronic acid and these things only seemed to cover up the issue some but not deal with the wrinkles themselves. This is the first time I can say the crows feet and wrinkles seem to actually be filling in (not overnight) I have been using the soap about 2 weeks once a day in the shower following up with instanatural eye serum and my skin actually seems to be healing and filling in around my eyes for the first time with any product. I did experience a little drying the first few days but I have dry skin. The nice thing about the soap is it is causing the skin everywhere on my body to look better. I have ordered the 6 pack and have decided this is the soap I will be using from here on out. Since emu oil is a carrier oil I also ordered some emu oil from instanatural and am going to try put that over the eye gel I use every morning from them to carry the ingredients from it deeper into my skin. I will update this post in about a month or so. I will not be buying phytoceramides any longer since they are expensive and the soap has done much more in 2 weeks then those ever did in over a year though I did see minimal improvement taking those. I am so glad I tried this soap. I have extreme allergies and sensitivities and am even allergic to many fragrance-free soaps so I was leary about purchasing this. After reading the great reviews and I saw the minimal ingredients with no added fragrance I took the plunge. Well, this soap does not aggravate ANY allergy or sensitivity and not only that , but cleanses exceptionally well. I really feel extra fresh after using this soap including armpit odor. I can not even use deodorant due to allergies and my pits smell great even after a long days work. It truly is a refreshing soap that can be used on the face too. My skin feels just very clean and refreshed after using. It is good to know they use emu oil in it (although I am not sure how much is actually used)  it is a very soothing soap. I use pure emu oil on my face after washing (I use Swanson emu oil which can be purchased on Amazon for a good price). Your skin will thank-you. I plan to always use this as long as they carry this. Please do not stop making this soap. It is a must have. Even if I had no allergies to worry about, I like to keep as many toxins away as possible so this soap delivers I haven't found a comparable soap to this Emu oil bar soap. I have sensitive dry skin and I am continually on the hunt for products which have non-toxic ingredients and have finally found what I was looking for in this soap. This soap leaves my skin clean and moisturized. I even use it on my dry scalp to calm and stop itching. This soap is so gentle I use it for my 2 year old's shampoo and body wash. For the cost, no non-toxic ingredients and the results I haven't found anything better after looking the majority of my life. I should mention now that it is winter I follow up with emu oil as a moisturizer and my skin no longer becomes dry and flaky after scratching even after a couple of days. I have since ordered the six pack and given a few out to friends and family to try and they too have had the same experience I have and said they will be ordering this soap for themselves. I had white heads, blackheads, grainy looking texture to my skin, huge pores, not too much present acne but always one or two big one's at a time, but most of all acne scarring. I've been researching emu oil for quite a while (really intense about what I put on my skin) and I stopped using the sisley phytoblanc milk cleanser (ridiculously expensive and after 8 months no difference) and switched it for this. BEST DECISION I EVER MADE.First I only used it on my body and sporadically on my face, then I noticed my face getting smoother, and it was more receptive to the creams I was applying afterwards. (la roche posay effaclar duo + and the shiseido 42 sunscreen) BEST COMBINATION EVER. The only thing I really changed was the soap, then I switched from the phytoblanc moisturizer to the effaclar duo + and the results were even more amazing. GET THIS SOAP. It is truly unbelievable. I got this soap for my son after reading the reviews it helps when someone has red bumps, I forgot the name right now but I'm so excited to say it WORKED!! The doctors (4 of them) said there is no cure, my son will have the bumps until he's probably 18... the bumps got worse and worse.. SO mom had to kick it into gear.. I got online, did my research and BOOM his bumps are gone!! The doctors were wrong.  THIS soap did magic within 2/3 weeks.  He has small scars but he's no longer itching daily and they stopped spreading until the ones he has left... I'm so happy, my 5 year old son is himself again.. all because of this soap! I ordered on a Sunday and received it on a Wednesday! I use this product on my face as a cleanser and it usually leaves my skin very dry. I have used it for 3 days now and every time I use it, the same dry feeling. I continue to use it because I am anticipating some good results (but so far I do not notice anything). To combat the drying, I follow up with a oil based cleanser and then the emu oil (which is very moisturizing for my skin). If I do the oil based cleanser first, the emu oil soap will completely remove the oil and I am left with that, once again, dry skin. Overall, there is no smell and I will give it about a month to see true results as I am still in the beginning usage of this product. My wife uses this more than I do, but she likes it quite a bit.  It does lather up well and washes off completely with no lingering residue.  It is very smooth and silky without any grittiness at all.  We use emu oil as well so it is hard to determine how good the soap is compared to the actual oil product, but as a bar soap it is very good and has no strong odor like some bar soaps.  Only issue we had with this product was the packaging, but the product itself is very good."
68,B000A0ADT8,"I used this serum for 2 weeks and it cleared a lot of acne and stuff on my face and neck.  I woke up one day and my face was completely clear! Been using this for years and years! The best! Skin very smooth and healthy after use. So far so good I’ve noticed a glowier look to my skin, plus the fresh citrusy smell is amazing. Glides on easily and works well with my other serums and moisturizers. Will defiantly buy again! Use it every morning before my moisturizer. I purchased this after try a sample which is was perfect but this one looks like is giving me an allergy, will keep trying to see if it is ok to use.  Also I didn’t see the collagen In the ingredients Great smell I am 34 years old with medium-light melasma and never-ending acne.  I purchased this in the hopes it would lighten the dark spots on my cheeks and help clear up my skin in general.  Previously I had used OTC hydroquinone but it was too harsh on my skin and left lasting red marks for a couple of days after use.  So far I have been using this product for about a week and have noticed that my melasma is a little bit lighter and after an initial break out (3 days) my skin has cleared up quite a bit.  It has a nice smell and is completely non-irritating.  I tried wearing it under my makeup but since I tend to have oily skin, it didn't work out very well.  We'll see how it works after another couple of weeks, but so far so good!"
69,B00081J4P8,"Best sunscreen for the money. I have used this for years and find it to be the cheapest and just as good as the more expensive brands I’ve used No Ad for more than 20 years.  It is a great sunscreen without all the additives that irritate sensitive skin.It looks like it may be discontinued because the price is way too high.  I thought I bought several bottles for the price I paid, only to find I bought a single bottle. We have been using this sunscreen for YEARS and stop selling I was so glad to find it again Use to use it for my kids at the beach and never got sunburned Great price for such an effective sunscreen I am so grateful that Amazon carries this brand since I can't find it in stores anywhere!  I bought a bottle a long time ago and it has lasted me for many years (not out in the sun an excessive amount) and when I was looking for more, I realized stores don't have it.I originally bought SPF 8 and this has worked in all situations (beach, pool, working in the yard, etc.).  I am fairly light skinned and if I'm out in the sun a lot, I burn first and then tan for the remainder of the season.  So, in using this SPF correctly, I avoid the burn and go straight to tan.  My husband is light-skinned and only burns, so he wanted a higher SPF, so I ordered this one... He actually goes between 8 and 15 and never gets burned.There isn't any smell, it's not sticky and I even put it on my face without any problems.  It's an awesome sunscreen and when I saw there were different SPF's, I bought those too!! Is it just me or this stuff doesn't really work compared to coppertone or another major brand.  Purchased this because it was a few bucks cheaper but felt like it either wore out quicker or just didn't protect as well as other branded stuff.  To be clear I'm not a stickler for any particular brand of anything and prefer to look at the active ingredients, and based on my anecdotal evidence of a week in the sun, this didn't really do the trick even with significant re-applies. If you look at the active ingredients for each brand it seems that Coppertone has a higher concentration of all of them, plus two extra - which, admittedly I'm not a chemist so cant speak to their effectiveness but could potentially be part of the reason for my lack of results with no-addNo-Add: Avobenzone 1.2%, Homosalate 7.5%, Octisalate 5%,Coppertone: Avobenzone 2%, Homosalate 13%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 2%, Oxybenzone 4%Ultimately I'd spend the extra few dollars to get the good stuff for your skin I've used No-Ad since I was a little girl. It's the only sunblock/sunscreen that I can use without breaking out in a rash. Sadly the stores in my area don't carry it anymore so I had to buy it online. The reason I chose to buy this one was because there was not an outrageous shipping fee. The others charged like 5-6 bucks to ship this 16 oz bottle. The product itself is fine but the bottle does not look taken care of. It's dinged and the labels are pealing off so that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. So over all product is excellent but I wish the seller would make sure his products are being taken better care of. Due to my sun sensative skin about 15 years ago my Dermitologist told me to apply sunscreen everyday for the rest of my life. He said I should get SPF 15 strength and that higher strength does not offer any more protection. So, I have been doing so ever since, rain or shine, summer or winter. After an exhaustive search I found No-Ad SPF 15 to be ideal for me. It applied evenly, did not sting my eyes, did not stink, reasonably priced and did the job. This year, 2007, I was unable to find No-Ad SPF 15 in any of my usual retail outlets - Walmart, Longs Drug, grocery stores, etc. Nowhere to be found. Only the higher SPF numbers that were not as good. Finally I looked on line at Amazon and behold there it is, so I ordered a bunch. Thanks Amazon for being my sunscreen savior.David J.Blomquist Good but a little greasy"
70,B000MVYJ0O,"I loved this soap so much. Gentle on the skin. Used for about 2 weeks helped rid most of my enzyme issues. Sadly, it didn't do great for my drains. The soap leaves silt on its path and it's really NOT great for the drain system. I had to throw away more than half of the soap because the silt started clogging the pipes. I am going to start off this review with the following statement. I do not believe there is a miracle product. If there was, everyone would buy that product and nothing else. This Dead Sea Mud soap is not a miracle product.However, this soap and this soap alone, which I use to wash my face, has been keeping my acne and blackheads under better control than the small arsenal of skin care products I had in my medicine cabinet. Not only that, it has evened out my skin tone and faded acne scars (I don't even think it's supposed to do this but it has). So, needless to say, I am blown away. Do I still get pimples here and there? Yeah. Do I still have some blackheads to deal with in problem areas? Yeah. Though not nearly as many as when I was carpet bombing my face with salycic acid, benzoyl peroxide and all that nonsense.The price for the soap is actually a bargain for the whopping seven ounce brick you get. Forget those wimpy four ounce soaps that are typically sold at the store; One With Nature gives you your money's worth and then some. There's not much to say on the packaging, it comes in a plastic wrap that you'd expect a soap to come in.The soap itself has a very nice, sweet cinnamon scent to it. It's not much, heck I barely notice it, but that's kind of the point is that the product isn't filled with artificial fragrances that could anger your skin. That's the problem we're trying to FIX remember!  The Dead Sea Mud soap is supposed to be on the more exfoliating end of the spectrum with granules in it to scrub away dead skin. Now, personally, I use this soap directly on my hands and the granules don’t do much, that’s just me though. To get a real exfoliation with this, go to your local Target and get some of The Bathery’s shower gloves. Lather those up and have at it. Of course, don’t rub yourself raw I accidentally did that once.This soap cleans terrifically and has really brought my complexion issues which I have struggled with since middle school under control to levels that I haven’t seen in any other product to date. Again, will it work miracles? Probably not, but it’s pretty darn close. These soaps are fantastic and One With Nature’s customer service was excellent in helping me discern the difference between the Dead Sea Mud and Dead Sea Salt soaps. This is money well spent. So I bought this way back in September or October I think but decided to wait to finish using it before reviewing it just to be sure of its use. I first tried the Vanilla Oatmeal kind of this One with nature dead sea minerals soap collection and that one was fantastic. I even tried an overnight mask on my face with that one and it worked miracles. It lasted for two months and then I was able to start using this version. Also I did not put it in a cover but just in the soap dish in the shower so it did not last as long (a month and three weeks) but that is my fault. This soap is the truth. I dont have very bad back and/or body acne but the ones that are there are pretty noticeable. After using this soap they are all gone and have stayed gone. I tried it for my face as a scrub but I may have overused it or it may not be for everyday use as I did not get any noticeable difference on my face. Either way I will highly recommend it as a fabulous body soap. It lathers well, scrubs nicely and does not have any EDTA, SLS, Sulfates, bla bla bla ingredients that make us raise our eyebrows once we realize they are in our skincare products. I even tried it as an overnight mask on my bikini line and it calmed down those stubborn ingrown hair bumps a bit. I think I will work towards buying a lifetime supply of these until they stop making them or until it stops working for me, which I hope is never. I normally break out everywhere when I travel back home to Ghana..and yet thanks to this my skin is still looking fresh and blemish free. I am sold. Ok, so I noticed that I've started to get Adult Acne  ALOT of Acne and I'm almost 40! Acne always signals my period...like clock work. So I purchased the Dead Sea mud soap. Second BEST PURCHASE TO DATE (out of thousands and I have proof...thousands) from Amazon! First best purchase was The Ultimate Ice Cream Book--but nevermind that now!  First couple times I rubbed soap directly on my face...HUGE MISTAKE. As it left red bruised patches on my skin...too Abrasive for direct contact with my face. Then I began to rub it on a wet wash cloth upon entering shower leaving on duration of shower, finally rinsing  off with cool water last just before getting out. For a sort of Poor Gal's Spa steam facial treatment. Then follow with Now Solution's Avocado Oil on my face, lips and body ( also purchased on Amazon, their Almond Oil is great too!) My scars and acne have almost completely disappeared and it's only been 4 weeks! I have Clear and Healthy 20 year old looking skin!  I got my period but NO ACNE...WOW!  Will share this with my family and friends as i have it on Auto delivery. Got my second shipment today...Still have 1/2 of bar left. Can't wait to try the Lavender and Lemon Verbena soaps next!  If  you have Acne and Acne Scars GET THIS SOAP! This soap has exfoliating granules not too harsh for sensitive skin. I have been using this as a face wash for years. It does not make my face oily. I do have very sensitive skin so I cannot use anything with scent and this has NONE. It cleans makeup off my face wonderfully. I just use it in shower with my hands. I do notice my face is dry during the cold winters here after use but it is not overly drying on a normal day. I usually clean my face then after shower apply moisturizer anyway. I had tried so many varieties of bar soap, but none of them really impressed me. This soap is incredibly soothing to my very sensitive skin. Even when I had temporary eczema, it did not irritate my skin at all. It does not leave a thick film like other brands and foams well. I have finally found the right soap I can use every day.  I recommend it to my daughter who also has sensitive skin and she absolutely loves it!"
71,B0018ZRTZA,"I did some extensive reading on peels and African American skin.Based on that - I decided to try Skin Obsession's 40% Glycolic Acid Peel and their 25% TCA Peel (no longer sold here on Amazon).A) I've had some persistent hyperpigmentation from old scars for YEARS and during the winter, when my overall skin tone lightens - they are even more noticeable. B) I also have some new scars - a result of an allergic reaction / contact dermatitis. (My skin breaks easily. I keep my nails short, but even friction from from a t-shirt or bed sheets can cause my injury to my skin if I have a mosquito bite or a rash.)  I wanted to lighten both old and new scars.Glycolic Acid Peels are recommended for African American / ethnic skin. The 40% Glycolic Acid Peel did produce some light peeling a few days later - but I wasn't satisfied. So after about 4 weeks - I tried the 25% TCA Peel.Neither peel burned during the application process.  And I never got experienced the 'frosting' either - but I stopped at recommended time.  Unfortunately - the morning after using the 25% TCA Peel, I my skin was red and raw in a few places.  I think its because I did not follow instructions and used a small stiff brush to apply it instead of gauze. I did this because I wanted to apply it JUST on the old scar - not the skin surrounding it. Once those areas were healed - it left me with light scars AROUND the scars I was trying to fade. SMH.  I'm sure the 25% TCA Peel works well for some but most articles I read warned that African Americans should avoid TCA peels. I was just hard-headed. Lol.Fortunately, I was able to treat and fade the new scars very easily.SO - my ultimate verdict: if you're African American / Black - stick with the 40% Glycolic Peel.  It may not produce rapid results but Rome wasn't built in a day!Other tip:  Just like a mentioned before - if you have a scar - WHATEVER you have successfully used to fade your scars - start your treatment as soon as the skin is no longer open or raw.  Consider using cocoa butter, shea buttor or Vitamin E oil while it's healing.You do NOT want to give your skin cells a chance to treat this new, darker block of cells as the 'new normal.' Scars are typically the result of excess collagen being produced at the site of a wound.  In African American skin, more melanin is sent to the area, resulting in hyperpigmentation.  You want to act quickly, so the cell regeneration and cell turnover starts immediately, restoring the original color of your skin in the affected area. This is my first review so bare with me.My background:  I am a 27 year old African American.  I have a dark skin tone of maybe Fitzpatrick skin type V, and I use this product to treat hyperpigmentation. I also have oily skin, which tends to be a problem as well. Before I begin, I'll let you guys know that this is not my first time using Glycolic acid for treatment.  I started in January of this year with a glycolic cream of 8%, and I have carefully progressed from there. I am from the Gulf Coast, so I experience a lot of hyperpigmentation in my face from working out in the sun. When I realized that the hyperpigmentation on my face did not fade during the winter (as it usually does along with my arms and legs), I became concerned and began my research for solutions. After reasonable consideration, I decided to give glycolic acid a try.June 2, 2014: I purchased this product after I completed a sample of 35% glycolic acid – lactic acid serum.  I received my product on time as anticipated; however, I was a bit hesitant because of all of the negative reviews that I have read about it.  I also didn’t see too many reviews from people of my age group or skin complexion; yet then again, I did not spare the time to read all of them.  So after about a week, I finally decided to give a shot.June 12, 2014: I followed the instructions to the letter. I did the patch test, which worked out fine.  A week later, I performed my peel. First, I cleansed my face with an organic clarifying cleanser and I made the mistake of using alcohol pads after.  I did not realize how much it was irritating my face from rubbing my skin too hard until I applied the glycolic acid 10 minutes later. Yikes! Never again will I apply alcohol that way.  I wasn’t able to keep it on for an entire 2 minutes. After about a minute and thirty-something seconds, I dipped my face in a sink filled with cold water. Once I rinsed the solution completely off, I patted my face dry and applied a generous amount of Aloe Vera gel. The next day, my face was firm but no signs of irritation from the night before.  I did notice most of my hyperpigmentation gone but not all of it.  I still had some dark spots from acne, but that is okay because I know that it takes time for things like this to work out the way I want.July 3, 2014: So the second attempt took place three weeks later after my skin healed. Mostly the same process with some changes: I used cotton swabs and witch hazel for my toner. This made a bid difference in the experience. I was able to last for 3 minutes this time.  No burning and no irritation. The dark spots have faded some more and my natural glow has returned.I have now completed my third treatment. I still have some dark spots that are fading slowly but surely.  I should have mentioned this before, but I do wear sunscreen underneath my concealer when I go out.  It is a SPF 70 and my concealer is an SPF 15.  I know it’s a bit much, but you can never be too careful down here in southern Mississippi. I also try to stay out of the sun as much as possible. So as far as fitness goes, it’s either at the gym or at home.In conclusion:  I am very satisfied with this product. My skin glows. I wear less makeup because of it (concealer, eye makeup, and gloss/lip balm).  I hope this review helps others (especially the ones like me) in their decision to purchase this product. Just make sure you check with a dermatologist first to see if this will work in your best interest. I didn’t do that (my bad). Fortunately for me, I knew enough about my skin to research and find out what works best for me.  Thank you "
72,B000052YOL,"This is a wonderful product, but Neutrogena has discontinued it.  I used it for decades and haven't found anything I like better, even at higher prices.  I contacted Neutrogena customer service and they explained that it has cycled out of their product line for now, but if there is enough interest, they could possibly bring it back.  If it is something you have used and liked, please consider expressing that to the company. This lotion was the best on the market! Tried several of the suggested replacements, and none of them leave my skin feeling moisturized. I wish Neutrogena would bring this back. 😫 I went on neutrogenas website and unfortunately it says this product has been discontinued. The next closest thing looks like Ageless Intensives® Anti-Wrinkle Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 20 Switch to this retinol product from a more expensive brand. Very happy with the results, working well and appreciate the extra benefit of the sunscreen protection. I'm an old geezer at 74, and this has definitely decreased the amount of wrinkles in my cheeks. My skin does not have any wrinkles because of this product. I'm 67 yo. I love this product and have been using it for years, now I can't find it. This product does everything it promises: moisturizes, protects your skin from the sun, and does help to even out dark spots, if used faithfully. I'm having a  hard time finding it in the stores, so I'm glad it's still available online. It's been my favorite for several years. There’s nothing about this product to dislike!"
73,B000177FXW,"Love this bar, for body and hair💚helps with dandruff, skin allergies, and rashes. I like this .. prefer the peppermint over this for scent. I do not like the smell and it dissolved pretty quickly Used this to wash myself and my clothes on my last river trip. I might start using it all the time! Their products last a long time and deliver excellent quality while being ethically responsible. I love how clean my skin feels when I use this soap, so much I bought some and sent to my family and they enjoyed this soap too. Great buy :) Overall I enjoy this soap it is a bit pricey for a single bar of soap and it leaves my skin rather dry I feel it has a pleasant smell and i like the idea of the tea tree oil I have read, with amusement, some of the reviews of this soap.  How complicated they seem to feel washing one's hair to be.""Oh it will dry my hair, oh it will dry my scalp, you have to mix it with something else.""  Maybe I'm just too dense to understand or because I'm a man, I don't get it.  I've used this soap - that's this soap, nothing added, no magic blending with something else - and I cannot in all my 81 years (and yes, I've been blessed to still have a full head of hair) remember my hair looking or feeling as soft, silky and shiny as this soap leaves it.  Perhaps I'm doing something wrong.  I first hook my spray head to the hose on my sink.  Next I wet my hair with pleasantly warm water.  Then, in my left hand, I take the bar of soap and rub it over my hair.  It makes a great lather.  I rub the soap into my hair and using my finger tips, really get it down onto my scalp.  I use my spray to rinse off my hair.  If my hair doesn't squeak when I rub my hands over it, I soap it up a second time, rub, rinse and towel it off.  I comb it and let it dry as I go about my daily duties.  I do this about every 4 days or more often if I do something that gets it dirty like plastering or tossing hay.  My scalp doesn't itch anymore either. I neglected to say I had been having trouble with itching.I'll continue to buy this stuff as long as I need it.  OH yeah, I do use it to wash my face and the rest of me as well.  The smell, BTW is very light but pleasant."
74,B0000536P4,"Been using this for years - I’m almost 75 and people think I look much younger.  This is lightweight and perfect for my still oily skin.  Originally started using it because of enlarged pores and uneven skin color - both of those problems have been corrected and have not returned. Truly Fragrance free.  Works well, no skin irritation.Free delivery with prime and I can find it without running all over town!  :)Price is high everywhere so neutral on price. Good product for sensitive skin , smmoth and soft to apply and not greasey I like the creamy smoothness , not greasy, helped decrease my dryness use all the time Amazing Feels great, reasonably priced, and…it works! I LOVE this Olay product & have been using it a long time. I’ve got extremely very sensitive skin & it doesn’t irritate me or break me out, (being fragrance free), which are hard to find. The price was EXCELLENT here, as opposed to other major retailers! My face felt soft, upon waking up. Plus, I’ve got a very mild case of rosacea (which is hardly noticeable), & it did NOT make it worse. I highly recommend this product. Thanks OLAY !!! And, thanks Amazon, for the great price & selling it!!!"
75,B0018MIT70,"I am extremely happy with this product. My skin has been itching for the past two months. I was constantly scratching my back and stomach. Even when I put on lotion the itch was unbearable. I used the body wash and I haven't had to scratch. My skin tends to get extra dry during the winter. Only con is that it doesn't have a nice fragrance like the body washes I'm used to. I would still recommend it. 5 stars Fantastic to alleviate dry flaky skin!  If you're looking for sudsy  aromatic this is not its purpose.  Does not smell as people state.  Been using this product for months.  Wonderful! For my keratosis pilaris and for regular moisturizer in the shower. Totally recommended. I have severe eczema and there are days that my skin is in pain. But as soothes I wash my self it helps me and I can function I like this when my eczema flares up. This is the only soap that helps calm my skin down. It’s unscented but there is an oily smell that goes away. It’s worth it because after a bath my skin isn’t dry and itchy like any other soap would leave it. Have 7/10 experience with this product. The quality is good within this price. If u have dry sky definitely suggest If you have very sensitive skin this is good. Doesn't suds much and not very luxurious feeling - kinda watery. But if your priority is to pamper delicate skin then you are willing to forego those things. UPDATE: I've been using this every day, head to toe (hair included) for almost a year now. I'm not allergic or sensitive to it AT ALL. That's incredibly rare for me.When I developed a new sensitivity to my conditioner (yay) and had to go without while I searched for a new option, my hair was not as shiny or smooth, and it got tangled easily, but it had good body and didn't have ridiculous breakage. So if you're the no conditioner type, this is a good option.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I hate trying to find skin care products. I'm allergic to a bunch of stuff, so I can't use most body wash, bar soap, shampoo, or lotions. I also have eczema and painfully dry skin. There is a grand total of ZERO shampoos and bar soaps and only ONE body wash at my local Walmart I can actually use. I hate it. It leaves me feeling slimy and doesn't wash well enough to prevent stinky body odor.I've used this for about a week now and I love it. So far I haven't seen any of the early warning signs that my skin is about to dry up and try to fall off. I use it as a body wash, shampoo, and for hand washing.CONS:It has a mild fishy smellYou have to shake it up every timeThe fish smell doesn't linger, so I only have to endure it while washing, I don't walk around all day smelling like a tuna.PROS:Reasonably pricedCreates a decent latherRinses quicklyNo stinky armpitsMoisturizing enough I don't have to use lotion constantlyIt works well as shampooThose last two are HUGE bonuses for me.There isn't a single shampoo I'm not allergic to at the grocery store, so washing my hair involved contortions and a ridiculous amount rinsing, trying to keep it off of my body. No matter what I did, I always got shampoo somewhere. Now I just lather on this body wash from head to toe and don't worry about itchy, flaky patches.Lotion is equally problematic for me. 100% petroleum jelly is the only moisturizing product I can use every day. Everything else makes my skin itch, crack, and flake if I use it for more than a few days in a row. With this I can skip lotion after my shower and washing my hands. Now I only use a little on my hands before bed.I REALLY hope my skin doesn't get sensitized to this in another week or so and freak out! I really like this stuff!"
76,B0013NHSYE,"That picture is at age 52, no filters applied.Every time I get out of the shower I apply this cream to my face since around 2015 when I first found the product.  I have been told by the ladies that my skin looks great.  My wife likes the clean scent.  If the product does nothing else just know that the sunscreen alone will be a benefit.  Better late than never! First few orders were great. Lightweight, cooling and very moisturizing. The last one I ordered felt different on my face. Very good moisturizer last all day non greasy. 👌 Works wonderfully on/for men's skin treatment. Actually does all of the above, will order again. Nice moisturizer with retinol.  The scent reminds me of Menen men's deodorant so that could be changed but the price was right (no pink tax) and it seems to work well. I’ve been using this product for two weeks now and see little or no effect. Hopefully I will with time. This product works amazing! Really does fight wrinkles and reduces existing ones. Also, I'm prone to acne with most face lotions.. but this one, no acne! Highly recommend. Good enough for my skin"
77,B00027DMI8,"I have spent a large majority of my 22 years in the New Mexican sun, and while I have been very good about sunscreen the last couple of years the sun damage of my youth has caught up to me and I found myself with 3 forehead wrinkles and a scattering of freckles and sunspots. While it might seem insignificant to some I hate to think what I'd look like at 40 if I already have signs of aging.So I did a lot of research into proven wrinkle treatment and in my search I discovered something. There are millions, MILLIONS of products, home remedies, and concoctions that claim to prevent wrinkles, treat wrinkles, make them disappear, and do a number of other things. However the ONLY FDA APPROVED ANTI AGING INGREDIENT is the various strands of RETINOIDS. That doesnt mean that nothing else out there works, but it means that the only one that has enough strong scientific evidence to be considered a treatment for anti aging is products containing some type of retinoid. When you go to a dermatologist for wrinkle cream, you will very likely receive a prescription strength retinoid because it is proven to work.What are retinoids exactly and what is the difference between the various types?Retinoids are essentially vitamin A, their structures vary in each of the three generations but generally all the retinoids found in anti wrinkle creams are first generation. They are in fact natural ingredients found in plants and animals and we consume them in our daily diets. Researching the various types of retinoids for anti aging there are 3 things that pop up.: retinol, tretinoin, and retinoic acid. It took a while to decipher what each of them is and after reading a number of papers about them the short summary is this. Tretinoin is retinoic acid (its also known by its drug name Retin-A) and is the retinoid you will find in perscription cream. The difference between retinol and tretinoin (in relation to their usefulness) is simply their strength. Tretinoin is retinoic acid that is directly applied and effective where retinol is applied and your skin coverts it to retinoic acid to be used.One of the dermatologist articles I read said she recommends anyone who considers a tretinoin to start with a retinol so you can build up to the full strength.Retinol and Tretinoin have been found to treat a number of different skin conditions, including acne, wrinkles, stretch marks, and even some studies have been done on its effect on treating skin cancer.How it treats wrinkles. When its applied your skin has cells that synthesize the retinoic acid and it increases cell turnover, thickens the skin, increases collagen production, Stimulates blood vessels in the skin, and reduces sun spots.One thing to know though is if applied everyday results will not show for 3-6 months with best results in 6-12 months. So for everyone who says they've used it for a month and haven't seen results, they  haven't been using it long enough, remember sun damage and wrinkles took years and years to appear and are not going to be undone in a month.The way to apply the product is to spread evenly 30 minutes after washing your face, to ensure your face is completely dry. While I have found different reasons as to why it shouldn't be applied wet most articles say that it: decreases effectiveness, increases risk for side effects like dryness and pealing/scaliness, and one article says it doesn't matter if you apply it wet, but putting it on while your face is completely dry can't hurt. Retinoids also make your skin more sun sensitive, so sunscreen should be applied daily (which if your trying to undo sun damage and wrinkles anyway than you should be putting on sunscreen anyway to prevent even more damage)Now finally for my personal results. I started using this product every night around 4 months ago and I have noticed a difference. My forehead wrinkles have almost completely disappeared, my sun spots have faded, and even my acne scars are less noticeable. For the price and effectiveness I would recommend this product. The only reason I do not give this product 5 stars is simply because it advertises itself as a deep wrinkle cream, and as I only have fine lines I cannot gauge its effectiveness on deep wrinkles.I hope some of the information about gives you a little insight into retinoids, but please know this is only basic information gathered by an individual from various scientific articles. I am not a dermatologist and if I was to go into more detail about retinoids this review would be 10 times longer. If you want to know more you should do your own research and talk to your doctor. I purchased this RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Anti-Aging Night Cream at the same time I purchased the RoC Rentinol Correxion Eye Cream. I've been using both for about a month now. I apply once a day, before bed. I did have some slight burning initially but no redness and the burning subsided after a little bit. It didn't cause any other sensitivities and I do have sensitive skin. My understanding is you do have to use products with retinol for about 3 months to really see results but I can already see subtle ones. My skin appears to be brighter and smoother to the point where a couple people have pointed that out.For full disclosure: I wash my face in the evening, pat with some earl grey water essence, let dry and apply this along with my eye cream. I then finish with a firming ampoule. So far I am very much liking this product and intend to keep it as part of my nightly regimen. I have a friend who has been using this for decades. She has incredibly beautiful skin and is nearly 80. After hearing several dermatologists discussing it as less aggressive than retin-a, I decided to try it. After a few weeks, I'm still not used to the heavy perfume smell, and am at a loss to why it is even necessary.  It causes my eyes to water - it's that strong. My cat won't come near me - it's that strong. I just can't use it. I have had mild irritation and breakouts as well, but that's to be expected. I will be looking into a milder retin-a. Dermatologist say this is the strongest retinol you can buy across counter. I’m not sure yet how it’s going to work because I haven’t had it long enough but I do like the way it makes my skin feel. I have sensitive skin,after applying at night I feel not burning sensation and able to sleep.This product is not sticky where as I don’t get it all over my pillow! I have very sensitive skin and this has always worked for me! Would absolutely reccomend! I have dry skin that is prone to hormonal and cystic acne. I have prescription retinol that dries me up like a mummy. This stuff does almost as good of a job at reducing acne and blemishes while being way more moisturizing. I still get dry and peely if I use it too many consecutive days, but I can use it several days a week and get glowy skin if I alternate with a heavy moisturizer on other nights. Or sometimes I put aquiphor over the top which also keeps me from getting too dry. Anyway, I absolutely love this stuff and it has definitely done a good job on some of my 40 year old fine lines and wrinkles as well, especially crow's feet and forehead. Repeat buy!! This product was a “what the heck” purchase for me as I have many expensive and decent creams for wrinkles and sagging etc.  This product is far better than any other product I have tried—and am buying a back up tube today."
78,B00163JVJQ,"A few weeks after ordering this on Amazon, SkinCeuticals sent me a free sample bottle of their CE Ferulic... (Do they have access to my purchase history? That was creepy.) BUT it did allow me to do a side-by-side comparison of this product and the SkinCeuticals one. (I also previously used Paula's Choice Resist C15. I like PC products and use their Clinical Retinol Serum, but for me, their C15 was more irritating to the skin than either CSS or SC's vitamin C serums.)So, back to my side-by-side comparison. (In fact, right at this moment I have this Cosmetic Skin Solutions Vitamin C+E Serum (CSS) on the right side of my face and SkinCeuticals (SC) on the left.) Here are my thoughts so far:Both products make my skin a little sticky, a little shine, and sometimes have a slight stinging sensation. They're both almost clear, but very slightly yellowish in hue. CSS is a little stronger in odor (kind of astringent smelling--not unpleasant. And I'm more sensitive to smells than anyone I now.), a little more watery in texture (drops roll down my face faster), and it's just a bit stickier after I put it on than SkinCeuticals. I've also had the CSS bottle open longer, so that might account for some of the difference.After applying either product, I wait a bit for absorption and then apply moisturizer. Once that absorbs, the stickiness is much less of a problem. And if I wear foundation, I don't notice the sickness at all.When I have either product on, my complexion glows. It's noticeable right away. It also tightens the skin a little right away. I really like the way my skin looks when I have either product on. As I mentioned, both products sting slightly sometimes. When this seems to last longer or cause a little redness, I take a day or two off. Neither makes my skin look yellowish (I'm caucasian with yellow undertones anyway, though). Also, my skin tends to be quite sensitive.What I've seen of the research on vitamin C is that  the results take several months to show. I'm 39 and interested in decreasing current/preventing future: sagging, dark spots from sun damage, and wrinkles. All the experts agree L-ascorbic acid is great for this, so I'm going to try to give it several months before making a judgement.Bottom line: ALMOST NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO PRODUCTS in my experience of them after a few weeks. And yet, CSS costs about 75% less than SC. It's a HUGE difference in price. I can afford a $40 bottle a couple of times per year. $165 is a dramatic difference. And let's face it, a rip off. Which I resent. SC has built a huge following with their branding, but it's not worth 4x the price for basically the same ingredients that several other companies (like CSS and Paula's Choice) offer. The ingredients are almost identical. (SC patented the pH of their formula, so CSS is a tiny bit less acidic in order not to violate the patent.)  And how much does it actually cost to manufacture this stuff? If other companies can make the same product for just 20-30% of the cost, then it's my feeling SC is making us feel like theirs is better by creating perceived value through a hiked up price and raking in enormous profits off of our desire as (mostly) women to look better. It ticks me off, and I'll do whatever I can to avoid these fancy brands with insane mark-ups. I like the product, but I don""t think it has a smell to it, I am almost 28 years old and decided it was time to really start taking care of my skin. My boyfriend just turned 40 and looks amazing... and here I am at 28 with fine lines around my eyes and laugh lines when I smile big! But other than that my skin looks pretty good. I don't get out too much in the sun... not because I don't want to but because working full time in front of a desk and being a mom doesn't allow for much sun bathing! So my skin had fairly even tone and no spots but I was amazed that this product made such a dramatic difference.This product is amzaing... I used just 3-4 drops the first night. It felt great. It instantly made me skin feel smoother and looked much brighter. I went to bed and woke up with the softest skin. That morning I used it again right after the shower. It instantly tightens, smoothes the skin, and brightens.I tend to have oily skin and breakouts and this seems to heal blemishes faster and didn't cause any breakouts.I knows its $30 a bottle but you use so little and its a fraction what the other brands cost for the same product.I am sold. I LOVE this stuff.*****NOTE***** Today is May 24 which means I have been using this product for roughly a month now. I use it every morning right after I get out of the shower. My skin looks so much brighter and smoother having added this to my skin care regimen. On the weekends, I find myself using this, my moisturizer/spf and a little of my smashbox primer instead of makeup and feel completely confident in my appearance. Its amazing how much my skin has improved without realizing it had that much room to improve! I also have noticed undery my eyes and my crows feet are much more smooth. The only downside is with my skin being overall more healthy, it does leave a bit of a shine to my face after I apply it. This was my very first topical Vitamin-C serum purchase, so take my review with a grain of salt (as I am unable to compare the results to any other brand). After carefully researching the efficacy of the different types of Vitamin C, I have come to quickly realize that L-Ascorbic acid is the best form of Vitamin C available. However, I also quickly understood that it is highly unstable and must be (1) Paired with Ferulic Acid and (2) Formulated within a specific pH range (below 3.5). Additionally, it must be stored in an opaque/dark colored bottle so that the stability is not compromised due to external light sources.My review: According to the company's description, it meets all the requirements. Vitamin C comes in the form of L-Ascorbic acid; Paired with Ferulic acid; Is below 3.5 pH. It glides onto the skin nicely (has a watery consistency). It is sticky to the touch; however, I believe this is standard and unavoidable. Because the pH is so low, it is acidic and therefore stings your skin a little. I have found that your skin gradually becomes accustomed to the stinging and I have not experienced any prolonged burning sensation nor redness. I have used this serum twice a day (morning and at bedtime) for the last 4 weeks.I take great measure not to leave the bottle unopened (as the surrounding air will destabilize the formula, rendering it ineffective), and I keep it out of heat/light. (I do not keep it in the fridge).However, I do have a concern: my formula has an extremely strong scent (that of vinegar). I do not remember this product smelling this bad when I first received it (or at least I don't remember). Is this normal? Did I do something to destabilize it without being aware? I really cannot handle the smell now: It makes my eyes sting/water, and the smell is just nauseating. I don't want to apply this serum if the formula has become destabilized, but I also don't want to consider it as wasted money. Is it normal for this specific formula to smell so bad? Please let me know as I feel uneasy about continuing to use....Thanks for any information you can provide to me. :)"
79,B0002JHI1I,"This facial wash is wonderful.  Leaves your skin very soft.  Have bought several bottles so far and would  highly recommend this product. Works well I love this product. I have  been using this product for a few years. I use it twice a day after washing my face and before putting on facial cream. It has a wonderful gentle smell and your skins feels so nice. No dryness or irritation. I wanted to try on several skin issues. I purchased it as a vehicle to apply the CoQ10.  Instantly improve a blemished skin appearance. Its the best cleanser i have used so far . The best thing i liked about this cleanser is that it doesn't leave any residue on your face hence doesn’t clog your pores. Just make sure you use a washcloth afterwards to remove it.Really good for mature and wrinkly skin. This toner is the best I have ever used! This cleansing milk is amazing! I have adult acne, and I have been trying to keep my breakouts at bay. I take prescription pills and cream to try to help. I have been using I am 61 years old and have been using this product for about 10 years.  When I was a teenager and into my late 30's, I used a product called 10 0 6 lotion by Bonne Bell because I had frequent breakouts.  As I got older, it was far too harsh and drying.  I began using various other products at that point, but not until I found Avalon's Perfecting Toner did my skin begin to really look good.  My work involved long hours and often I was too tired to do a full facial cleansing routine late at night.  Still, I didn't want to go to bed with a dirty face.  So, I began moistening cotton pads with this product to cleanse my face as well.  Took off all the makeup and dirt easily, no breakouts and I noticed my pores began to appear smaller.  Today, I begin and end my day with Avalon Toner, and although I no longer fall into bed too exhausted at night to complete my cleansing routine, I can tell you that my skin has never looked better!  Few wrinkles, tight pores, clear skin, minimal sagging.  I won't stop using it unless  they stop making it.....and you truly cannot beat Amazon's price.  In order to get the free shipping, I place my order for 3-5 bottle at a time.  My last order was for 3 and they lasted me from Nov. '13 until now, Sept.'15.  I am a VERY pleased customer!"
80,B001F51TDG,"I’ve been using this spf moisturizer every morning since I was 20 (well back then only spf 15 was available, but of course now use the 30). I’m now 53 and don’t have a single discernible line or wrinkle on my face. Of course I use a thicker waterproof sunscreen and hat when hiking or swimming, but I can’t speak more highly of this product. Doesn’t cause acne, lightweight, and moisturizing. I wanted a day-use product which I could wear on cruises, without feeling the need to lather-up with sunscreen.  This worked fine, but does have that ""sunscreen smell"" which I had hoped it didn't.  I love Olay products and creams, but the scent of this one makes it a no-go for me in future. I have been using this product for many years and I am very happy Using it for 2 weeks now. Nothing spl to mention, but does hydrate the skin for sure. Will wait for the summer to see the SPF effect. Been using this moisturizer for years.  Tried others, even expensive ones, nothing works as well for me.  I don’t use makeup, just lipstick & get compliments constantly about how good my skin looks.  Even my dermatologist told me to stick with this product. When you get near the bottom of the bottle, the pump no longer works to dispense the product. There is still about 20% left in there. I take the top off and try to force it out but it is difficult so I usually start a new bottle out of frustration. I like the product itself, moisturizing and I hope it is protecting my skin from the sun. I had to switch from using Aveeno moisturizer to this one because they stopped making Aveeno moisturizer.  This one is just as good with double the sun protection.  The price is about the same too.  I used Aveeno for many , many years and this is a close replacement. Recommended by my Dermatologist, been using it for years!"
81,B001G7PLZ0,"This bar far is the best lotion. This is the only lotion that keeps my eczema from flaring up, with this Olay I have no need to reapply. Last year I bought some, I realized they are no longer sold in stores. I have used this for decades. Last year I paid $15 for 2, now it is $70 for a bottle. This is absolutely one of the worst case of price gouging. I hope olay brings this back and put it back in stores. The new brand is nothing like the old.  The shimmer had the best scent. I have been using this particular product from Oil of Olay for several years. Tried it after watching a beauty YouTuber that I follow suggested it for pre self tanning. It’s perfect for summer because it soaks into the skin and doesn’t feel heavy. It has a light scent when applying but not much scent once it soaks in Found that due to A/C and then Forced heat my skin would suffer due to dryness. I ordered this when it was at a much cheaper price AND was available. Love the scent and is not overpowering and helped the dry skin I have.. I have been using Olay products for DECADES & this is absolutely my all time favorite This lotion compared to all others I have tried smells good not over powdering goes on light not thick like most, spears evenly works in qwick you don't have to rub forever to get it worked in your body, and once on it dose not feel greasy or oily just smooth and refreshed skin is what you feel. I have real dry skin and so Ive used lots of lotions for dry skin they leave you Ricky oily greasy well this lotion dose not smooth soft and puts some vitamins even back in your skin witch skin like mine you'll take all the help you can, I also loved thatwhen I looked up the 10 best lotions out there this was up at second on third I remember, so even better,and for the price you get two big 20fl oz bottles for the money. Every good nothing better then a real good deal for the money. I would tell a friend I will buy again it stay the same price and deal cause I like this lotion hope it stays. I will say props to play lotion good job I think on my scale of 1 to 10 I give it a big 91/2 I will keep 1/2 just cause Ive not used it long enough to say how well it moisturized my very dry kin but I will come back later to tell OK I ordered the lotion because I thought it was the same one that I was using the Olay Quench body lotion the original ones that I've always used over the years had a shimmer in it like a little glitter but this one didn't have it other than that everything else is okay I'm just disappointed Use to be at CVS for bout $18. Now it’s twice the cost. Olay does not have it on their website since the pandemic. Others have inquired too yet seen no response from Olay. I love everything about it, didn’t want to run out so I ordered two!"
82,B00014DMQE,"I've been using this for about 3 years now and have glowing, youthful skin at 40 years old. I get compliments on it often. This stuff works great keeping my skin clear and fresh BUT BE AWARE--DON'T put it under your eyes. I started doing so thinking it would help my under eye skin since it worked so well for my face and never considered until having 2 years of constantly watering, dry, red eyes with painful eye styes every other month that it was from this until sitting in the eye doctor's office discouraged and all of a sudden it dawned on me that my face product could be causing it!!! LIGHTBULB! I started avoiding all around the eye as if I had a racoon mask on and that was the ticket! I haven't had an eye stye since and I no longer have to wear sunglasses on cloudy days from light sensitivity! PHEW...that was ROUGH. Love the product, BUT be careful not to get it near your eyes. I purchased this 10% glycolic cream after a very negative experience with using a prescribed hydroquinone to lighten dark marks on my face. Instead of it lightening the marks, the hydroquinone burned me and left me with darker, nearly black marks on my dark brown skin. Needless to say, I was devastated and without hope. I unconvincingly had to conceal the marks every day and felt that I would live that way for the rest of my life. The skin even scarred and was rough and bumpy making it look even worse under makeup. I began researching TCA chemical peels but was put off by the downtime, excessive peeling, and risks factors for women of color. I knew I wanted something much gentler but effective, and was willing to try anything. One week of using this glycolic cream has already given me so much hope! After applying this for 3 consecutive days, my black marks have lightened by at least 15% and have completely smoothed out, removing the rough bumpy scars left by the hydroquinone burns! My skin did peel. I can't believe it! This stuff is very powerful..and with that said, depending on HOW you use this cream, it can significantly improve your skin or permanently damage it. That brings me to my #1 gripe about this product-It comes with very limited instructions. There are definite DONT'S that should be followed when using this product and I shouldn't have to read through \ reviews to find out what to do and what not to do. While I am very pleased with my initial results of lightening my hyperpigmentation, I came very close to burning my face in other spots! This says to apply it 2-3 days, but I does not say that you SHOULD NOT apply this every day consecutively! DO NOT apply this for 2 or 3 days without taking a break between applications! DO NOT over apply (i.e., apply a layer, let the product dry, then apply another layer). The more you apply the more sensitive your skin becomes and the more likely you will burn yourself which is what nearly happed to me. If you feel anything more then a tingle/slight sting NEUTRALIZE IT IMMEDIATELY! This was my mistake. I took the ""burning"" feeling in my cheeks as ""tingling/stinging"" and it was not. If you have to wince, if you think ""ouch"", or have to fan your skin...it is burning! Stop what you are doing and neutralize with water and baking soda. Instead of doing this, I woke up the next morning with a huge black scab on my left cheek and was horrified! I immediately stopped applying the product and thank god it all peeled off within a few days. But I have been left with some light spots in those areas at this time. I'm hopeful they will darken back up, but it could be unlikely. However, I prefer slightly light spots to dark hyperpigmentation, so I am relieved at this point. Even if you are dark skinned/African American you will have to wear an SPF every single day once you begin using this product, otherwise, your spots will darken back up. Aside from the improvement to my hyperpigmentation, my overall completion improved after those few uses. A friend even commented on how good my foundation looked when I wasn't wearing any. I'm still giving my skin a few days to heel from my scare, but I do plan on continuing to use this product. I only intend on using it twice a week with a day or two in between, however, I am going to avoid those sensitive spots. I am anxious to see how my hyperpigmentation will improve further and I am so grateful for this product. I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel!P.S. I am not a person to write reviews but wanted to share my experience with others in similar situations looking for a solution to their skin problems. I’ve used Reviva’s glycolic acid as a face cream for decades, but I never realized how effective it could be in relieving my dry, cracked, painful fingers and hands. I had always washed it off my hands after applying it to my face. Recently, I put some on my hands which felt like shredded plastic. Unlike other hand creams I have tried which just sit on the surface of the skin, the  Reviva glycolic acid cream was instantly absorbed, softened my hands, and relieved the painful finger cracks. I highly recommend it for face and/or hands. I had always had a spot or two on my face but once I hit my early twenties I suddenly found my skin a battleground strewn with every type of acne you can imagine. I had white heads, I had black heads, I had papules and pustules, and I had cystic acne. All of this around the jaw and chin like a damn beard of pimply shame. It got to the point where I hated looking in the mirror and constantly considered darker thoughts because how could I live like this? I was afraid to go bare skin at the beach, camping was a nightmare, I hated taking my makeup off at the end of the day and I never wanted my husband to see my bare face. Even if I had ONE day where I didn't have an active break out, I had horrendous hyperpigmentation and since I am extremely fair, it was really obvious.Add to that the damn quest to find something, anything to calm my persistent hormonal acne. I tried birth control, I tried antibiotics, sulfur washes, prescription creams, and finally accutane. NOTHING. NOTHING WORKED.About a month ago I stumbled upon this product and read the reviews and thought ""Well... Why not?"" In a MONTH my acne was gone... It took care of everything. You know those stubborn flesh colored bumps that you can't squeeze and seem to never go away? They were gone. I am still amazed at how much I like my skin. I still have a lot of scarring but everything is finally healing and I'd much rather deal with a few scars than a million angry bumps.So this product does have a bit of a burning sensation but it's not going to give you a chemical burn, you kind of just have to deal with it until the tingling subsides which lasts maybe a few minutes. I use this after I thoroughly cleanse my face of makeup. I use an oil cleanser for makeup mostly around my eyes then I use a gentle wash to remove the oil and remaining foundation. After that I use the ROC resurfacing disks every other day which you can pick up for about 10 bucks at the drug store. I have completely stopped using any sort of exfoliating product with beads or nuts or any of that crap because they just irritated my skin. I find that the ROC pads gently exfoliate and really get rid of dead skin cells. After that I put the glycolic cream on and if I feel that my skin needs extra hydration I'll put on a night cream. That's it. With the exception of the gylcolic cream, you can get everything else from the drug store for under 10 bucks. In the morning I wash with a gentle wash again and then put on sun screen.That's it. My acne is gone and my skin is now fairly normal (it use to be very oily). I'm not at the point where I would go out without foundation and concealer but the topography of my face is smooth and I'm using far less products to cover up my skin. I'm hoping that the hyperpigmentation (which is also benefiting from this cream) will be gone by summer so I can just enjoy a light, fresh face.If you are thinking about getting this product, just try it. For less than 20 bucks it might completely change your skin. If not, I really hope you find your holy grail product someday because I've been where you're at and I know how it feels."
83,B001ET78QK,"Gave me color, and goes on thin. I bought this on a Wednesday after finally finding a dress for a wedding on the next Saturday. Used it every day. It obviously isn’t going to make you a bronzed goddess, but it did give me some color so I didn’t look like Casper. I saw some reviews about smell, but I don’t think it’s too bad. Like any other tanning lotion. A little chemically, but also smells like the beach. If you’re looking for a quick way to get some color this will work This product is very moisturizing and provides a gradual “tan”.  I like that I have complete control of the “tan” by how many days it is used.  There is no streaking and washes off of my hands easily without staining and there has been no staining of clothes yet.  Please remember, there is NO SPF protection so you will still need to use sunscreen.  There is a slight scent, but nothing I find offensive. I put this on after every shower. I do mix half lotion half the Jergens  it does not streak gives you a nice tint to your skin, and I am very fair. Plus the added bonus takes away all dry skin love this product. Only used it a couple of days so not sure how dark it will be,  but it does not smell like a lot of other self tanning lotions. This lotion works incredibly well and you see results fairly quickly, within two days or so! Great for helping with tan lines and giving you a summer glow year round! Highly recommend! This product works slowly but it does work and it doesn't leave you feeling greasy. It doesn't streak. It looks natural. We have ordered this several times and will continue to. My friend talked me into buying this.  She has a tan in the Winter using this Jergens product.  It doesn’t streak if you use the right amount and rub it in completely.  There’s no bad smell either. Gives a quick bronze when I want to wear a skirt…. Pretty happy with the product. I bought the suggested mitt to apply the product, so it wouldn’t stain in my hands. Eventhough the glove had a weird feeling, I’m really glad I purchased that too"
84,B000O5RVJO,"Having had non smooth, bumpy complexion due to a history of acne hard to treat, this product has quickly cleansed pores leaving skin smoother, with white heads and black heads GONE. Put on before bed and see the progress daily and lessen the amount used as days go by. Quite amazing, must be a Hollywood secret! This is the first thing that has worked on cystic acne around my jaw area that I've been struggling with for several months, now. I was getting ready to make an expensive proactive purchase, but I'm so glad I decided to try this first. P-A works great on my regular acne, but I really haven't had an issue w/that for a couple of years. It doesn't do much for this cystic stress acne. Anyway, here is how I've been using the buffering lotion (in conjunction with the MB acne face wash):Each morning and evening after cleansing my skin and doing my k-skincare routine, I place several drops of the lotion on my makeup mirror tray. Dabbing my finger in the lotion, I gently massage it in circular motions along the whole of both sides of my jaw line and under my chin. Then, dabbing my finger again, I tap a concentrated amount directly onto any ongoing or developing blemishes. This can be tricky as its watery, but you figure out how to get the right amt on your finger.Next, if it is morning, I go ahead and do my eye makeup before my foundation routine in order to give the lotion time to do its thing. I use powder mineral foundation, so I can't say how this would work in conjunction with liquid or bb cream. But it doesn't seem to effect my powder foundation at all. It blends right into my skin when I brush on the foundation.Be realistic. I began to see results after about 2-3 days of steady use. But it took about 2wks to clear up my tenant acne. You know the ones you can't ever seem to get rid of? They are fading scars now, but I still treat them daily. Yes, you may have some drying in some areas. I use a light non-comm moisturizer and this seems to help prevent most of that.For those complaining about the alcohol: the alcohol is there to kill the bacteria on the surface of your skin. It quickly evaporates and leaves behind the medicine to do its thing.Give it a try & be consistent! Good luck! This is going to be a long review since I love this product so my apologies in advance. I hope it helps someone.Advance Warning - Both of these products have isopropyl alcohol which is *extremely* drying. It works but its possible to end up with irritation like I did. After about 4 days I ended up with a slightly itchy rash. There was no redness but a bunch of tiny bumps. It reminded of contact dermatitis. Fortunately my breakout was done by then. If it happens, don't freak out. Stop using the product for now. It will go away and it can be covered up by makeup without irritating the skin (be sure to use non-irritating makeup.) It can take up to 2 weeks ago. Mine did. The skin may have a slightly rougher texture for a couple more weeks after that. Exfolation can help. You will be able to use the product again in the future but use it sparingly and only on the areas needed. I think what caused it for me was putting it over the whole area of blemishes and being lazy instead of exactly where the spots were. It might seem like an unpleasant side effect but I really needed to get rid of the breakout that just kept multiplying. It was worth it to me as I think it was my fault for not being more careful. It isn't guaranteed to happen to you but if it does I wanted to share my experience. It will be ok I promise.I bought and use this in conjuction with the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion so I left the same review on both. I use them together based on another reviewer's suggestion so I can't rate them separately. That being said, oh my god this totally works. I was seriously blown away. I got a very unpleasant hormonal breakout of papules (blind pimples) on my chin during lady time and whenever I get them they take forever to go away because the infection is so far below the surface. To make matters worse anytime one went away another would show up. I had about 4 in the same spot and they were very painful. I really didn't want to spend that much on a product but the breakout had been there for weeks with no improvement from anything else I used and I was getting desperate. Below is a product description and how I used them.Buffering lotion - This product you can shake before application. Its a very thin, white liquid that's rated by Badescu as being better for Cystic AcneDrying lotion  - DO NOT SHAKE. A lot of people have been making comments about how the product settles. Its supposed to and the directions clearly say do not shake it and to use a cotton swab to dip it in the ""pink sediment"" then apply. This product is rated as being better for whiteheads.For my routine I waited until the evening and cleaned my face then applied the buffering lotion to the blemishes with my fingers as the instructions said to do. I waited about a minute until that dried and then used a cotton swab to apply a bit of the drying lotion. I used the products for 5 days just to be sure but I could have stopped at 4. I now have NO blemishes anymore and I'm just working on getting rid of the pigmentation marks. Those I can deal with. I'm extremely happy with this products performance and I highly, highly recommend it.Here is a bit on the different types of blemishes because it can be confusing trying to figure out what you have (Correct me if I'm wrong. Its based on my own personal research.)Whitehead - Standard, unremarkable. Not inflamed. Just looks like a small spot of pus. Goes away quicklyBlackhead - Open pore with oxidation causing it to look dark. Not inflamed. (These two products aren't designed for blackheads so I don't think it'd work on those.)Pustule - Inflamed whitehead. Infection at the surface but there's a lot of angry redness around the blemishPapule - Inflamed whitehead. Infection deep below the surface. Aka blind pimple. Its a closed comedone where the infection can't reach the surface. These can last weeks. They are hard to the touch and painful.Cystic Acne - Large, inflamed acne. It is one of the more severe types. It will feel soft the touch and be large in size. Rupture can cause spreading of the infection and lead to more outbreaks.Nodular Cystic Acne - The same as cystic acne but the infection is deeper under the skin and will be hard and painful the touch. Will not rupture but will not go away as Papules eventually do.The two types of Cystic Acne will likely need to be treated by a professional if severe. I'm not sure how these two products would work on small, minor Cystic Acne but its worth a try. Based on some of the other reviews this does work if its not very severe and all over the face.Note - Before you panic like I did and think your Papules are Nodular Cystic Acne, there is a difference and its size. Physically they feel the same but Papules are 1cm or less where as the Nodular acne is 1-5cm.Hope this helps! This has worked wonders for clearing my acne"
85,B0013KY296,"Let me tell you I do a lot of research online about alternative organic natural & healthier treatments for everything & when I found the herb Neem I finally found the holy grail for clearing breakouts of all kinds like to get rid of skin infections on face or for body you need to prepare the concoction that I mentioned below(on #3)and add about 100 ml or 3.51 fluid ounces of it to your bathing water to treat Acne, Rashes, Mosquito/Bug Bites & it really works. But I did not use only it, let me tell you what I did. I purchased here on Amazon 5 Neem products:#1.) Neem Foaming Face Wash - 150 ml Price: $12.99 I didn't  like the lotion was to thin There is so much I could say about this lotion that I don't even know where to start!.. But, I want to state what this lotion has done for me in a total of 3 days.I have always had terribly dry skin.  I live in a place of extreme winters and dry summers, which makes skin VERY unhappy.I live with a very common skin disorder known as Keratosis pilaris ('KP, also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris).  Which leaves me with flesh on my upper arms that looks like its covered in goosebumps.I used this lotion daily (after a bath using the Theraneem soap, and I would soak in the Neem water left by lathering up the soap in the bath [I read a book to pass the time!]) covering my ENTIRE body from my toes to the bottom of my jaw, (it was used up in 3 days, so I WILL be buying more).  However, on the VERY FIRST day I noticed a change in my skin.. the tightness was gone!  When I scratched my skin, I didn't see flakes of dead skin flying off of me and into the air.. My gentle scratching didn't even leave scratch marks.  My skin felt glorious!  Now, for my KP, the bumps are gone....G.O.N.E!!!  That ""cheese grater"" texture to my upper arms is completely gone. My skin feels like a baby's bottom.. lol!  I have been driving my friends INSANE telling them about this lotion and the power of Neem Oil (because that's a major part of what healed my skin).  Because I am THAT excited about what it's done for my skin.. After trying thousands of creams and lotions, none of them could do in years what this did in 3 days!  Also, this stuff is free of acids, alcohols and parabens.. it's also safe for Vegans.  That's a plus for me.. putting poison (mineral oils, parabens, etc) on your skin doesn't help it, it damages it.Many people avoid Neem because, well, it smells, just terrible.  But, not this lotion, they have scented it with grapefruit essential oil.  So, it has a very nice smell, if you like citrus.. if you don't like citrus, then it probably won't smell nice to you. :)If you have a severe skin condition, such as eczema, psoriasis, and KP (not itchy, but it can really damage a person's confidence), you need to use this daily and use the Theraneem soap as well to see results... If you have relatively normal skin, you can get away with using this sparingly on problem areas.For the FIRST time in 12 years, I will be able to wear a short sleeved shirt in the summer and not feel self-conscious about my upper arms.. I will be able to wear shirts and dresses with straps, instead of trying to find it in long sleeves.. I can stop wearing a jacket in 80 degree weather because I was ashamed of my arms.. I LOVE this lotion and will NEVER use another type again!  I feel like crying I'm so happy!  I can't praise this lotion enough! I do not believe this Neem product is intended as a moisturizer but rather to be used more for healing, It is very helpful when used on hands that are toughened from constant gardening. Better yet, when applied to small abrasions it speeds healing. I learned about this product years ago when searching for the answer to fix acne on my cat's chin. This went to at least two veterinaries because his chin was blackened that was determined to be acne. The veterinaries didn't have a solution and I am not sure they were even the ones who made the diagnosis. After reading that I should use Witch Hazel, I went to the supplement store and learned that Witch Hazel has an overwhelming order. Neem is odorless. As I was telling my partner that there was no way I could use this on my cat, a woman behind me suggested Neem (I use the gel). Before purchasing, I checked the Neem website to be sure it was safe to use on animals and smiled because a photo had shown instant results for a dog that had thinning hair. That photo probably wasn't entirely true but it came close. Much to my surprise the cats acne was gone in 24 hours. Veterinaries were unable to solve the acne problem. Since that time I have also used the gel to restore hair loss on a cat. It is best to massage the product until dry or distract the animal until it is dry. An animal will want to lick the area. great lotion This cream is a much easier way to get the skin benefits of neem than using the oil straight. It disguises the pungent smell of neem with citrus oils. If you have a poor sense of smell, this product will just smell lemony; if you have a good sense of smell, you will smell the neem underneath, which isn't the greatest odor. But who cares because neem is so great for your skin. It is wonderful as a daily moisturizer and it can also treat skin problems."
86,B0013KY6I8,"Theraneem Neem Leaf & Aloe Gel feels so good on my skin.  I especially like it for my feet.  Feels good, it is refreshing and isn't greasy!  Truly a great product! I have been using this product for over a decade for Immediate pain relief and first aide for Sunburn,, Insect Bites and Bee Stings.  Also the Neem Mouthwash and Neem Stick - Lip Therape.  I always ensure I have a three products on hand.  I have used the Neem Mouthwash for first aide for myself and pets on cuts, acts as a pain relief and antiseptic. I use this for many purposes, including wounds on my critters, softening callouses, etc.  Best thing ever for scrapes and burns! Have used this product for years. The Neem literally stunk! They changed the formula and now no annoying odor. Great for after sun on the face! I initially tried this product at my local health food store but they did not have any in stock, only the tester, but I was so impressed with how well it absorbed into the skin without being tacky, I went online to order it.  If you suffer from dry hands but find that lotion leaves your hands greasy and tacky (a problem if you work with paper in an office setting like me) then this is a good product for you.  When you first put it on it feels like thick Aloe Gel (which it does contain) and you think ""ick, this will never absorb"", but it really does absorb quickly.  Although your hands feel smooth and soft like they have silicone on them, they aren't tacky at all so you can touch things almost immediately.  It also has some natural antibiotic qualities because of the Neem Leaf so it's a great product! This is a great moisturizer! I’ve even put it in my hair to de-frizz my natural curls. Love this! Fave body moisturizer ever! Fresh natural smell. I have sensitive skin and this is lovely and super moisturizing! It has gone up in price unfortunately quite a bit. Works great on my 8yr old daughter as it provides instant all day relief from her lifelong severe eczema itch. Amazing Neem leaf & Aloe gel act as a natural antibiotic & have anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, soothing & cooling effects. We stumbled on this product at our local natural foods market 3 months ago. On our last visit they were out of stock. I was relieved & surprised to find it on Amazon for a great deal!I was delighted by the standard free shipping on orders over $25 & the unbelievably speedy, well packaged, delivery two days after I ordered it!!I recommend this amazing product by Organix South(THANK-YOU!) to anyone who suffers from severe itching especially babies/children who struggle with the nightmare of eczema itch. We seal it in with a good moisturizer(we use Alba unscented original body lotion). We've pretty much eliminated the harmful use of corticosteroids with the power of all natural products, foods & vitamins."
87,B000UO3GGQ,"I am hispanic, have a fair to medium complexion, skin tends to be dry or combination, have a few freckles and spots. This didn't help my spots but, then again, mine are from stubborn melasma and no one product alone has worked on them. I continue to buy this cream regardless simply because I love the texture. It feels perfect for me.  Its not oily or greasy, not too thick, not too thin and runny, not too rich, not  too....I don't know what the opposite of that would be but, whatever it is, its not that. I alternate use with this one... This is the first time I have purchased or used an Ole Henriksen product, but as I creep toward 34, I noticed that my skin needed something more. I use this product at night (I am posting this under my husband's name, by the way...). A friend recommended adding this in as the last part of my nighttime routine. I do like it and feel it has made a difference, but it's not quite moisturizing enough for me. I have really dry skin and so I usually use this, let it soak in and dry a bit, then I put a light layer of Cetaphil on top. I don't use it in the morning because I find it makes me makeup kind of shiny and it wears off faster. But overall, I do like it and a little goes a long way-- I am guessing this jar will last me about 4 months with using it sparingly every night. Very light weight not greasy This is the best face lotion ever for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. The ingredients are less harmful on the spectrum of things women put on their face, and I feel like there is a slow fade of my summer sun damage, without irritation from retinol.I used to work in cosmetics, and developed sensitivities to several products, especially fragrance. This does not trigger eye or skin allergies for me. I can basically only use vaseline, some lip balms (no beeswax, chemical sunscreen or natural fragrance! Plants are awful!) and a few other Ole Henriksen products as a base, or else I get stuffy and grumpy and cry.I use it morning and night. I would bathe in it if I could. Product appeared to be used I FOUND MY HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT. I have acne prone skin, and a VERY OILY skin, not combo but VERY OILY everywhere. I break out all the time,  but  this product has stopped my skin from breaking out. I put it at night, and I wake up with a very smooth oily yet!  calm skin. It has dramatically reduced my dark spots from acne scarring and has reduced the redness of my skin. If only I can use it during the day time too, but I simply can't it is not the products fault it's just really my SUPER OILY SKIN. But overall I am in love with this product, I will repurchase! 3 stars for the price, which over 4 months, has crawled up by A LOT. The cream is a 5 star not because it helps with aging (diet and water helps with that though) but because it's non greasy, moisturizes and doesn't cause breakouts. I like the cream for my combo skin but not enough to pay this spike. I went with a different one from this brand for half the price. It also has great reviews. I also buy it for my mom who is in her 60s and she likes it. We'll be looking at something different because of the price increase I absolutely love Ole Henriksen Sherer Transformation, but unfortunately when it arrived, it was opened and dried out and I had to return it. The price had increased dramatically, so I had to go and purchase it at Sephora.This is the very first time this has happened with this product, so I only took off one star."
88,B000P1S0N8,"I have super sensitive skin. I got rosceasa, psoriasis, dry flaky skin. One thing I don't suffer with much is acne. I used to use a different company that had a green tint cream to hide rosceasa but they discontinued that a line time ago. It was helpful as long as you don't over do it. I find the same is true here. Look, if you are having a flare that makes you a bright red tomato, don't expect a cream to make you porcelain white in 5 mins. That's not going to happen. I see some people complaining about they look green after applying. How much are you putting on? I find a over sized pea is more then enough to do my face and blend into my neck. I pump it onto the back of my hand , drab Little spots all over , then smear in circles with my finger tips and it's fine. If you are trying to use a quarter size that's probably way too much and making you look green. I find it absorbs after 5 mins. Has a velvet finish when I touch. I haven't tried with makeup over but I don't think that would be n issue as it's not a serum and it's not just sitting like dew on my face. And trust me, I have freckles and very uneven skin tones. Not those really cute defined freckles but they look like random splotches on my face. I still don't look green. I don't look super glossy or pet porcelain after. Have reasonable expectations with a product. It helps my redder spots look more like pink. That's reasonable for a product that isn't meant to fix pigments. Basically it should help your cheeks not look like your related to Santa Claus, but you aren't going to magically be a skincare glowing goddess either. If you want to truly fix your pigmentation, you need a laser, ipl, or a chemical peel every month to turn new skin over . I feel some of the negative reviews here are either using too much product, or have unrealistic expectations. I do wish this had a better spf. That's where this formula falls short. I really like this! I use it over serum and it makes my skin so smooth. Not greasy at all like some other redness camouflage products can be. Plus it has a little sunscreen which is a plus. Great job concealing the red as well. Will definitely buy again. I’m afraid this product was not for me and my skin type. Now that I’m aging, I need more of a cream like product that helps reduce redness, and while it does reduce the redness, it did not work well with my face type. This may work for other people it just did not work for me. This product is amazing once you figure out how to correctly apply it for full-face redness reduction. I use full-strength Retin-A for my cystic acne, which leaves my face permanently red. This lotion works very well to conceal and correct that redness. It also does not cause breakouts for me, which is a rarity! I deducted 1 star for 2 reasons: 1- It's hard to get an even coverage that blends well. 2- Foundation does not sit well on top of this lotion, so it's only good for use alone, not with full-face makeup.I use this on days where I don't want to apply a full face of makeup. Here's what I do to get it to look good:1- Wash face. Optionally, apply preferred face lotion (this face lotion isn't moisturizing enough for me, so I apply my Olay face lotion first).2- Use one pump of this lotion and dab it on areas closest to the center of the face (nose, chin, etc.). Use circular motions to rub the lotion into the face while slowly blending it outwards. To avoid a harsh line of green around the edges of your face, you'll want the least amount of lotion on the outer edges of the face.3- Avoid getting the lotion in your eyebrows and places of high peach fuzz or facial hair concentrations, as the green pigment will stick to those hairs and be very noticeable. If you get the pigment there, rub to blend or wipe it off with a wet q-tip. Also avoid applying under the eyes, as the pigment will make under eye circles look darker.5- Be sure to end all rubbing in a downward motion, to keep peach fuzz laying flat on the face.6- Once I get a blended coverage, I dot a tiny bit more lotion onto pimples and acne scars and rub to blend.7- Finally, because this lotion can cause under eye circles to look darker (even when not applied to them) I use a tiny bit of yellow/orange under eye corrector under my eyes. I use the Dark Circle Concealer Correcteur by NYX (because it cheap and it works), but I'm sure any yellow/orange undereye product would work.8- If I'm going for a bit more of a done-up look, I'll apply a tiny bit of concealer (only where needed), fill in my brows, and put on mascara. Still a very small amount of makeup, but looks natural and looks good!"
89,B000GF1E54,"Es exelente, desde el primer día notas el cambio, las líneas de expresión se suavizan, vale la pena comprar Tgis was a gift for my momma and she likes it so that's a yes. My skin is super dry and this product truly makes a difference Very good and easy to spread doing good job on wrinkles The odor is horrendous.  Medicine/antiseptic/tea tree/eucalyptus/mothballs. I am getting amazing results.  I will order again.  Yes.  It works that well.  The discoloration on my neck is almost gone.  The wrinkly old lady neck is gone.  Yes, gone.  Soft and smooth to the touch, not greasy.  I wish I could give them another star, because the product, for the money it costs, is that good. I really wanted to love this cream. I love that it is packaged in glass and doesn’t have a plastic inner cover. Unfortunately, it made my skin very irritated. I would love if they made an unscented version! It’s a good product, and I have no complaints, except for the smell. It’s strong and it’s not a nice smell. I don’t notice it after the lotion is on my face for a bit, but definitely upon application. I bought this because I saw on-line that it was a dupe for It cosmetics Confidence in a Cream. I was skeptical because I had never heard of this brand before. I absolutely LOVE this stuff!! I don't think I've ever used a face cream that I feel like actually makes a difference but I honestly think this cream makes my skin look better. I was using a drugstore brand before this and it was making my face break out. I am no longer getting break outs and I actually look forward to using this!"
90,B000OQ6YTG,"Scent is wonderful! Smells like the shampoo my salon uses which is exactly what I was looking for.  Bubbles last a great amount of time…don’t disappear quickly though if that’s what you are looking for. Liked the long-lasting bubbles…the scent didn’t suit my taste. I love this bubble bath!! It smells so good! It is only the second time I've used it, but I couldn't help myself - I had to write a review. I LOVE this stuff! It is probably the best purchase I have ever made, period. First of all, they do not test on animals. It is cruelty free and I could pronounce everything on the bottle with ease. Secondly, most, if not all, of the ingredients are organic (the first being organic aloe leaf juice - which is lovely). Third is that it smells DIVINE. If you like peppermint, you're in for a treat. It's not even the fake peppermint, either, it smells fresh and very strong, but not overpowering at all (unless you use a lot, which leads to my next point). Fourth, and probably most important, is that it makes a lot of bubbles! A little goes a long way and they actually LAST. The bubbles are comparable to sulfate-laced competitors, and they actually last longer in my opinion.The bottom line is that if you want a luxurious bubble bath without all the chemicals, you want this. I was really impressed with this product at first glance. You don't need a lot of it to get a tub that's just overflowing with bubbles, and still makes more when you're adding hot water. It smells pretty great too.I like to sit in the bath and watch a movie on my laptop, but the bubbles are 75+% gone after half an hour. This is a great product if you like shorter baths, but I'm not that person. This has become one of my favorite bubble bath staples!  The scent is concentrated, but not overpowering.  It is very relaxing.  It creates just a small amount of foamy bubbles on the water, so when I reheat my bath, I tend to add a little more to the water.  I have sensitive skin, & this didn't bother me at all.  This shipped promptly & arrived well packaged.  My first bottle is getting low, & I will definitely be ordering more before it is gone.  I also ordered the lavender chamomile scent in this brand, & it is nice as well. Much to my surprise, I actually enjoy the rosemary mint scent more.  If you found this review helpful, please vote helpful.  Any questions will be answered to the best of my ability. I love everything about this bubble bath. It smells  good, and it makes my skin soft. I also love the body wash as well. You only need a little because it lathers really well and my skin feels amazing after I get out of the shower!❤ Bought this because I wanted something rosemary scented. I like the scent a lot but mint is very much present. 7/10 for bubbles... it wasn’t completely lacking but I’ve had better! Liquid is runnier than my other bubble bath go tos ( aura cacia and dr teals) but I don’t have anything to compare to."
91,B00008CMOQ,"This product was suggested to me 20 years ago and I still use it to this day. You can actually see the clay getting spackled into your pores. My face feels super clean and my skin firm after I use it. I use it 1-2 times a week. I just turned 40 this year, but everyone says early 30s! Sometimes a classic is a classic for a reason. You can pull my mint julep mask from my cold, dead, but surprising youthful looking dead body. Put this on a pimple as soon as you see it (feel it) and it won’t even show it’s face Dries  up your pimples and blackheads faster 💯%recommended👏😁 I've used this 4 years with the queen Helen mud pack, I tell it's never steered me wrong I have great skin at 53yrs old been using since I was in my earlier 20yrs now you know, peace. I used for years, nothing better for me. I've usedthis for years but it's not as easy to find as it used to be. So glad you hve it! Love this product! It smells good and you can feel it cleaning your skin. I have used this mask for years. It makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. I use it for spot treatment as well in order to dry up any new acne blemishes. It keeps them from getting more inflamed and shortens the duration of them being on my face lol!"
92,B000V96R1G,"Jury is still out on this.  I get pimples along my hairline and on my forehead, especially when there is lots of humidity.  This seemed to clear up the pimples faster but I hoped that it would keep them from coming back.  So far, no.  Will keep using and follow up in a couple of weeks for final decision about the product.Really smells good!I have used the product consistently and when the humidity went away(mid-October 2016) so did most of my skin problems. I get cystic pimples all around my hairline in the warm weather.  I have used up the manuka part (orange on the top) and was going to throw away the bottom part thinking that it wouldn't do anything for my skin.  Decided to use the propolis and haven't had a pimple since then!  I use it twice a day and if I see the start of a pimple I massage the propolis into the skin and it disappears! Just bought another bar. I will have to wait and see what happens when the humidity comes back in the next few months.  Hopefully, the cystic pimples will not reappear.  Will keep you posted.  I give the product 5 stars! This soap helps with acne (for me, at least), and it gives just enough moisture for me. Oh, yes. There is also a pleasant scent. I've jumped on the Manuka Honey train since my mother used it in post surgical recovery to great effect.  We both have sensitive skin and this product seemed to be a non-medicinal type of soap containing manuka honey.  I received the soap yesterday, and I must say, the perfume fragrance is a bit intense.  If you're a purist, you won't be happy with all of the FD&C Red and Yellow added to create a two tone color look on the top and bottom of the soap.  (It's totally unnecessary if you really like the soap.)Although the honeycomb shape is clever, it's not a practical shape to try and grip very firmly.  Like I said, the shape would be irrelevant if the soap was all that you wanted/needed.  It seems like there are other manuka soaps out there that I will be trying in the future.  The manufacturer's of this soap care more about fitting their soap into a honeycomb package with two tone colors with a heavy scent.  The actual manuka and propolis ingredients come after the perfume, just for some perspective.  Overall, nice to have in a guest bathroom, but not exactly what I was looking for. I use this soap daily in combination with I live in a humid climate and my skin gets very oily sometimes even with only a light moisturizer. I bought this soap for its purported acne-clearing abilities, and wanted something that would not be over-drying. My face is not broken out right now but after several days of extreme humidity it does feel uncomfortably oily. I've used it for three days now instead of my regular cleanser and what a relief! My face feels soft and oil-free yet not tight and dry as other soaps have left it. It smells good and does not bother my sensitive skin. I may be using it every day now that summer is almost upon us. I don't wear a lot of make-up, just some bare minerals blush and lipstick and this removes it very well; there seems to be no residue left on my skin. I still always use a toner after cleansing just to make sure all the make-up and grime from the day is gone.I recommend this highly for mature skin like mine (48 - that is considered ""mature"", right?!) that is sensitive and needs a little balance.Yet another great product from Koru Naturals! I bought this product after reading an article that recommended Manuka Honey. Manuka Honey is supposedly great at fighting staph infections as a natural antibiotic. It is also suppose to help with scarring.My daughter caught a staph infection on her leg last year and she had another one this year that wasn't as bad. I then had my first staph infection this year on the side of my cheek. It started out as a pimple and ended up being a staph infection. It left a purplish scar on my cheek. It was horrible. I tried all sorts of things to make the scar go away - Vitamin E oil, creams etc... This product was the only one that has helped.It lessened the scar on my face (not completely gone but it's a dramatic difference). It left my skin feeling soft. My complexion is amazing. It's even reduced my sun spots. I wash with it every night. Love it! I bought extra soap for my kids and husband. I think this will help us in fighting staph in the future."
93,B00142DXVG,"I really like this sunscreen. I’ve got very very sensitive skin and I hate the feeling of product on my face. This product doesn’t make my face breakout, is easy to use, and doesn’t feel heavy. The only thing about this product is that it takes a bit of time to rub this product into the skin so that white streaks don’t show. But it’s hard to find sunscreen products that don’t leave white streaks. Another thing is that I wish the spf on this sunscreen is higher. Good product overall. I like this affordable sunscreen. It rubs in very well. Not like other Alba products- it is thicker and leaves a white film behind I liked this product except it has kind of a sour smell. It's not overly strong and does dissipate but nonetheless smells weird. This product does not irritate my skin or leave a white cast If I used the absolute minimum amount my face didn’t look as powdery/white.  I never got a sunburn while wearing this and it’s odor free. I work out in the elements and on the water in the deep south so sun protection is a must. I have fair, combination skin (very acne prone, but also sometimes dry) so finding a product that works is rare. At one point I became concerned with some ingredients listed in chemical sunscreens and the possibility of them causing cancer (both my mom and grandma have had skin cancer). I really loved using the Hawaiian tropic line, as they were lightweight and smelled amazing, but they had ingredients that had the possibility of being dangerous. As a result I searched for a mineral sunscreen instead. I have found that most mineral sunscreens simply do not feel as lightweight/airy as chemical sunscreens; this being said, this sunscreen is great. I have been using it for 2 years and have had no issues with my skin breaking out despite working in very hot and humid conditions. The sunscreen feels very thick at first, but does blend well and once blended in does not bother me with a tacky/sticky/heavy texture, even after applying multiple times in the heat. I have also worn this sunscreen under makeup, and it does well with mineral based foundation but sometimes a liquid foundation will not spread/blend nicely combined with the thickness of this product (this could be due to the type of foundation I use, however I don't wear makeup frequently so some foundations may work with this product). I wouldn't recommend this for use under liquid foundation overall, however the quality for the price and safer ingredients can't be beat for ever day use. I will continue to re-order this product as it is difficult to find in my local store. After we made the decision to switch from chemical sunscreen to physical sunscreen, I purchased 4 different kinds of well-rated physical sunscreens to try and gauge which one I liked the most. This was my least favorite of the bunch, and I would not recommend based on how it applied and made my skin feelNote that all physical sunscreens will be more difficult to apply and harder to rub in than chemical sunscreens, so it is hard to compare the feel of physical sunscreens vs. chemical ones. Quick primer - physical sunscreens work by containing active mineral ingredients that sit on top of your skin and deflect UV rays. Chemical sunscreens create a chemical reaction on your skin to turn UV rays into heat.In order of preference, here are the 4 sunscreens that I tried. All 4 sunscreens protected me from the sun, so the ranking is purely on ease of application and overall feel. Top 2 are recommended, bottom 2 are not:#1) *Recommended* Blue Lizard Baby 30+"
94,B0009I4J4G,"Muy buena crema, hidratante Seriously,  $21.00 for this? Good price but didn’t like the smell Fine, works a whole day The scent smells like cherry medicine (the pink one we got as children) so it’s not an indulging fragrance. However, on the plus side it moisturizes well and leaves a silky feeling after. It absorbs mega quick and feels good. 8/10. I used this lotion when I was preganant and have no stretch marks. They stopped carring it in the stores so I have to order it but not such a pain when you have prime. I swear by this lotion and all over use. It smells amazing and doesnt sit heavy on your skin. Thank you again for delivering my lotion in a timely manner <3 Excelente I love this lotion formula. It rubs in so easily! Once I rub it in it's like it was never there except my skin feels better!"
95,B000OY5W3M,"I am a product junkie, I’m always looking for solutions to my adult acne and I cannot be without this cleanser. The best exfoliate I’ve ever tried and it has made a huge difference in my skin! I got a small sample of this cleanser from a friend who swore by it. I used it once and loved it, but because I'm really picky about what I use on my face, I wasn't ready to fall in love until I had used it for a week.By day 3, I found myself excited to wake up and wash my face because of the fragrance and the feeling it gave my face. 3 re-orders later, I still am excited by it.So why is this different than all of the other exfoliating cleansers, or just facial cleansers in general (I used to use Origins Checks and Balances, for context)?. First, the fragrance is intoxicating. Not like in an old lady strong perfume way, and in fact it's not even that strong, but it delivers a refreshing experience from the second you screw off the cap to scoop some up some exfoliant. Note, the fragrance doesn't stay on your face after washing it off  (which I like). Second, the exfoliant dissolves on your face as you massage it in and it's extremely gratifying. Third, many of the cleansers I've used in the past leave a residue that is hard to fully scrub off. That isn't the case here; this comes off easily when you splash water on your face, but doesn't compromise on getting any dirt/dead skin/oil off. Fourth, it also doesn't leave your skin dry. Many cleansers I've used leave my face shiny/uncomfortable to move because it's so dry. I don't even have to put on moisturizer after this (but I do). Fifth, good price and it takes me awhile to get through the small tub using it 2x/day (a little goes a long way). Sixth, I don't hate when it gets on my lips/in my mouth (don't eat it, but if it gets on your lips you'll understand and maybe kind of like it, too). I really enjoyed using this product for several reasons: (1) it smells amazing, (2) ingredients are all natural, (3) feels awesome on skin, (4) and lasts a while.I think it's too expensive for me to buy again, and when I received the product the lid wasn't closed all the way so a bit of the contents spilled out before I even started using it.When I got to the bottom of the barrel I decided to try and make my own exfoliant. I just used lemon juice and sugar. It felt virtually the same as this product except the sugar crystals in mine didn't dissolve on my face as quickly as their's did. Interestingly, I found that because I added more lemon it ended up helping my skin more then most products I bought from the store. I use my mixture twice a day. The lemon has minimized my acne scars and the sugars pull out zits under the skin.Before you buy this or buy again try making your own exfoliant like I did. It's very comparable to this product and costs less than a dollar to make a full batch. I'll probably experiment with other natural ingredients around my kitchen at a later date.But if you insist on purchasing a product I really enjoyed using this one, and I recommend it :) good luck I've been using this product for many years and love it so much.  I love the smell, the texture and how it leaves my skin feeling so clean and free of any old, dead skin cells.  I would give the product itself a 5 as a rating.  But...the new packaging is horrible.  First of all, it is so huge for such a small jar that the box that was needed to ship it was very large.  And, to get at the product is just about impossible - having to cut through all kinds of hard plastic to get to the jar.  Just the recycling alone of the packaging for one small jar is ridiculous.  Please go back to just sending the jar, wrapped in bubble wrap.  That was so much better. I've been using this Suki exfoliating cleanser for over a year now and I just love it.  Leaves my face super clean and fresh feeling.  I love the all natural ingredients in this brand.  I've used a lot of products over the years but this is my favorite.  Other products would leave my skin dried out or greasy feeling.  This one leaves my skin feeling just perfect.  I will note though that the product has changed since my last purchase which was a year ago.  It was a lot more liquid and the jar was a bit different.  Now the jar is better, the product is more dry than before.  However the dryness is good in my opinion as I was always left with so much extra liquid in the jar before.  Now its not too dry that its bad or anything.  In my opinion its perfect now!  If you've considered trying this product go try it because its amazing!  I started out using just this but I have slowly added on more and more Suki products and so far I love them all! This stuff is magic.  It seems impossible for a product to get your face so clean without drying it out, but this scrub does it all better than any other product.  Granted, it might seem a little dry in the jar, but just add a drop of water or two in your palm and it's perfect.  I now prefer it that way so I can get the consistency that I want every time.  The packaging is awful, as other reviewers have pointed out, but the product is amazing. The first thing I noticed - this cleanser smells so wonderful! It's refreshing, citrusy and herbal thanks to the lemongrass and other natural botanical ingredients. The consistency is smooth with gentle grit for scrubbing away dirt and dead skin. As you use it the texture turns from a scrub to a foamy cleanser, and leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and refreshed. It's a really enjoyable addition to my morning routine, and absolutely worth the price! I have used this product a couple of times and  thought it to be one of the best exfoliates I’ve ever used but I just returned a jar that the contents was dry and seems as though it had been opened  so I recommend the product itself but shopping Dept “messed up “royally this time"
96,B000OYNCES,"I recently tried this brand of lotion in a different scent and found this scent, vanilla musk, and wanted to try it. I am pleasantly surprised by how nice it smells! It’s just the right blend to make me smile when I apply it and not too strong or overwhelming. I am sensitive to strong smells. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to cost of the product. I would like to make this my go to lotion but feel like I won’t be able to continue to buy it at $20 a bottle. I like every thing about this lotion Hydrating and great fragrance Good smell. Not too strong. Great texture. Not too thin or greasy. Works well. I've almost used it all but the pump doesn't get any lotion from the sides of the bottom bottle. It's too thick to use a funnel to get it out & besides sawing the bottle in half idk how I'm going to use the rest of the lotion. I don't like wasting money & don't want to throw away the remaining amount of lotion. If I didn't love this lotion so much I wouldn't buy it again but a tube instead of a hard plastic bottle would be easier to get all the lotion out. This lotion is amazing !! The scent is just enough and my skin feels sooo good I love hempz i also use their body scrub and it leaves my body so soft and smelling good. This lotion definitely smells good and I highly recommend Light fragrance but great lotion to keep my hands soft since I wash my hands quite frequently….wish it was a stronger fragrance. I haven't used this yet, but I believe in Hempz to deliver a satisfactory product. However, I love scented lotions and was really invested in the scent I thought was getting. While the scent is not offensive (it's pretty generically medicinal in nature), it's still not Vanilla-like at all. So yeah!"
97,B001ET7BQC,"Excellent mask, makes skin soft, shiny and smooth.  Good price for an excellent product, worth every dollar. I had been paying an arm and a leg for a professional strength papaya enzyme mask, so I was so excited to find something over the counter (OTC) at an affordable price. The user reviews for the same product in the single jar were pretty good, but I took the leap of faith by purchasing the 2-pack at a better discount, especially with the 15% off Subscribe-and-Save option.At first, I thought it did not sting at all but when I tried it again, my skin did get the expected tingling feeling. After 2 months of using it religiously 2 +/-1 times per week, Alba's papaya enzyme mask is now part of my daily beauty regimen. I am about half way through the first jar, so the 2 jars may last 6-7 months (I think closer to 6 months, since I love this stuff). I also bought a large fan brush, which uses a minimal amount without wasting much and effectively spreads a thin layer across my whole face. If you use your fingers, then your consumption rate may be faster. Make sure to wash your face thoroughly and dry with a fresh face towel before applying any mask. Although this mask (feels more like a gel) does not dry (as indicated on the packaging label), I believe the enzymes are effective in softening up the skin and breaking down the oils, dirt and old skin. Every time, I follow up it up with a clay mask, such as mud or mint (different brand), which does dry and pull out the dirt and oils from the pores. Of course, a non-greasy moisturizer is a must as well. Bottom line: I love how this product clears up my pores and helps my skin radiate.These jars with fan brushes would make great personalized beauty gift baskets for girly Christmas gifts or stocking stuffers. With that said, I definitely would recommend this product to family and friends! Really. I can't. No matter what expensive products I try out, I always keep this around. I am so glad I discovered this product. I used to use this department store brand enzyme peel (also organic) but it was $50 for 2oz of product. After I found Alba's Enzyme Peel, I never looked back. I have mild acne-prone skin and I often get pigmentation afterwards. This product ""peels"" away the upper layer of skin and forces my skin to heal a lot faster. As a result, my skin is more even-toned and smoother. I use it about once or twice a week depending on how my skin's condition is. I never go a week without it. You can tell if the product is working because you'll get a tingly sensation. My skin turns pink temporarily and when the tingling sensation is gone, I wash it off.However, I do NOT recommend using this product too often. It tends to lose its effectiveness, I noticed. There was one year where I had very bad acne, worse than I've ever had. I became obsessed and started to use this product everyday in hopes to getting rid of acne. While the product helped get rid of some redness from the acne, the source of my acne problem was deeper and I ended up just desensitizing my skin from the Enzyme Peel. (I had my wisdom teeth pulled out soon after and the antibiotics actually helped get rid of my acne, thankfully) Anyway, after giving my skin a break, I came back to the Alba Enzyme Peel and I continue to use it weekly as I did. I appears that if I just let my skin rest a bit, the effectiveness of the enzyme peel comes back. After my mother noted that I needed to take care of my skin as my daughter wouldn't like having an 'older looking mom' when she grows up (moms, gotta love them!) and after several years of neglecting my facial care, I decided to dive in to help my complexion, suppleness, and overall look.  After looking up numerous reviews from another site, I found the review for Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme Facial Mask and was impressed by the reviews and the price!I love Alba's natural organic ingredients.  I had just started using a pore cleansing mask and radiance mask when I added this mask into the rotation.  After one use, I could feel my skin was softer, improving the texture of my skin and it seemed to brighten it a little as well.  I had also had one pimple that had formed on my forehead.  The duration of the breakout was shorter and the scarring/recovery of the skin much improved than another breakout that had happened just the week before within an inch of the same spot.I generally have a T-zone with my cheeks getting drier as I get older.  It seems to work well overall to balance and manage my skin.You only need a thin layer applied onto your face (and neck, if you choose) and it does not dry completely.  The enzyme will cause a tingling sensation as well.  You can find a mask brush to apply if you desire.  I haven't yet and it hasn't been a problem. Received a double pack a few weeks ago and the product I received was obviously old and past it's effective date. I could not find an expiration date anywhere on the boxes or jars; the ones I purchase in local stores always has a date stamped on them.  This product normally has a nice clean green color and when applied to the face causes an immediate tingle from the enzyme so that you know it's working.  The jars I received contain a dark grey murky looking solution, like spoiled fruit. When applied to the face there is no tingle or feeling that it is working and when rinsed off my skin is no different that it was before I applied the product. I have used this product for years so I know what it should look and feel like.  This is the first product review I have ever posted but I had to let others know that this purchase was a waste of money and a big disappointment and will deter me from purchasing any other facial products on line."
98,B0016S0Y4M,"I have severely dry skin, occasionally bordering on eczema.  While this won't cure an outbreak, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth that outbreaks happen MUCH less often.  In fact, I haven't had one since I started using it.  This lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I had tried them all:  Lubriderm, Eucerin, Vaseline, Suave, you name it.  This is better than all of them combined.  Fragrance-free so the whole family can use it.  Thick and moisturizing without feeling greasy.  It feels so soft and smooth going on and really penetrates into the skin. It lasts all day, so I don't find myself scratching dry spots near the end of the day.  There are no dry spots!  I feel like doing a ""real person"" commercial for this lotion, and it's rare that I feel so positive about something.  If you have dry skin, this is the lotion to use. Works great on dry skin!No oily feel after. Completely odor free.I know several people that use this so here are some tips.When doing your hands, start with your nails. If they absorb it all, add more.Pack it against the cuticles and let it soak in (5 min), while doing the rest of your hands.This stuff will absorb into the skin, so for severe dry spots make a thick pad of it on the dry spot.After it absorbs, do it again. Do this a few times in a row until your skin won't take any more.Two days of that and the dry spot is gone. After that, just moisturizing maintenance. Aveeno is the only lotion that actually seems to moisturize my skin. I have extremely dry skin that gets itchy if I don't moisturize sometimes twice a day. I love the fact that this lotion has no smell and does not leave a sheen on my skin, nor does my skin feel greasy to the touch. I use this lotion on my face and body and feel that it has drastically improved my skin tone - no longer red in the t-zone - and I have fewer breakouts along my jaw line. I gave it four instead of 5 stars as this lotion does the trick, but the Aveeno body souffle works better. I wash my hands a lot throughout the day due to my job and I used to get really dry hands.  All other products I've tried through the past few months just didn't cut it and then someone suggested I try Aveeno so I picked up a few bottles here from Amazon.  The product does work well and doesn't wear off through the day however I find it takes quite a while for the lotion to soak into the skin before the oily feel goes away but other than that, I enjoy and use the product. I have been an Aveeno fan for years and used this product over the last several months so I thought I should write a little something about my experience.What I like about it is the colloidal oatmeal ingredients and the easy application. Its not greasy and it absorbs quickly. Its relatively safe for adults and kids as it relates to environmentally friendly ratings and natural product contents. It doesn't stain your clothes or have an obnoxious odor.Here's where I struggle a bit with it...its not really that natural. Read the ingredients and you will see what I mean. But more than that is it leaves a slightly tacky film on your skin after it dries. I think this is why they can say it lasts up to 24 hours. I keep this by the changing table and use it several times a day because changing diapers dries out hands like nothing else.  I have another one by the kitchen sink for use after washing bottles.  It has a mild scent (unscented), is not greasy, doesn't bother my son's skin if I touch him after putting it on.  I also looked it up on the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep website and found it has a very low toxicity rating, which is important to me.  I like this enough to include it in a gift basket for other new moms. I bought Aveeno thinking it was all natural, based on the label. I should have read the detailed ingredient list first!  This product contains Petrolatum, which is banned or restricted for use in cosmetics in the EU. The Environment Canada Domestic Substances List classifies Petrolatum as a high human health priority and as expected to be toxic or harmful. The European Union applies the risk phrase R 45 (May cause cancer) with Note N to petrolatum. Note N reads ''the classification as a carcinogen need not apply if the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen. This note applies to certain complex oil-derived substances in Annex I''.  PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are common contaminants in petrolatum, also called petroleum jelly. Among the studies linking the petrolatum impurity PAHs to breast cancer is a Columbia University study in which researchers found that the breast tissue of women with breast cancer was 2.6 times more likely to contain elevated levels of PAHs bound to DNA (called DNA adducts) than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer (Rundle et al. 2000). The National Toxicology Programs finds that some PAHs are reasonable anticipated to be human carcinogens, and the State of California lists a number of PAHs as carcinogens in its Proposition 65 program (NTP 2002, OEHHA 2004).  Shame on Aveeno for putting petrolatum in a product they tout as all natural! As a guy who doesn't use a whole lot of lotion type products I was pretty lost about a year ago when I developed an inch long dry spot on my face.  I tried several different lotions and creams with absolutely no change.  I was starting to consider seeing a dermatologist when I saw the reviews on this stuff and decided to give it a try.Within a week, my face cleared up (this is after having this dry spot for over 6 months).  Now I use it almost every morning - something I never thought I would do with lotion.  I recommend it very highly."
99,B00005B9FV,"Why in the world was this fantastic lotion discontinued?  I can’t find it anywhere end it is the only thing that kept my skin looking good.  The cream is terrible. I have used it and I will not buy it again. I am so so disappointed in this company. Please, please, please bring this back! I have used this for decades. It's light and feels great on my face.  I started using it when I was younger just for its moisturizing - now I appreciate it for the job it has done in minimizing wrinkles.  I have used the cream version too, and simply do not like the heavy, gooey feel of it on my face. Can't emphasize enough how much I want this lotion back in production!! I'm a guy and I'm allergic to after shave lotions, and, I'm getting older. This product is light and is absorbed readily. I only wish I could find more since it seems to be rare on the market. It’s a good moisturizer with no fragance or parfum I love this and will be purchasing again, but lets start with why a person may not want this: it gives you an all day dewey look. Some prefer not to have that as they may feel oily. If thats you this is not your product.It can travel into your eyes/mouth if you are sweating. I use the cream liberally, so this may not be a thing if you use it more conservatively.I dont use enough makeup to care, but this does not seem like it would mattify enough to go under makeup.REASONS I LOVE IT: inexspensive! Not a large bottle, but the price is super reasonable when I got it (like $5.) It has a very neutral scent which is great because Im ultra picky about that. It never irritates my sensitive skin, and doesnt make me break out (a unicorn in my world.) It does moisturize the bejeesus out of my face, which my fine lines need. It visibly reduced them in just a couple uses, though progress slowed after initial shock results. Still reducing them, but at a slower pace. The spf is there, but not so much it makes me look actually greasy, more hydrated and dewey.Lastly, the bottles pump works very well and I doubt it will break. Very well made and never a hiccup with getting product out. 10/10 will purchase again! I'm a woman over 50 with very dry, sensitive skin. I also use anti-aging face creams with Retinol that dry out the skin and can burn. A good moisturizer is very important to use to counteract the dryness and irritation of Retinol and Ohio winters. It took me hours to research which moisturizer would be best for my skin. I read articles on skincare searching for a product that was super hydrating and for sensitive, aging skin.  Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Face Lotion with SPF 15 was on almost every list and I remember using Eucerin when my son was a baby and suffered from eczema. It was gentle and effective for him so I trusted the brand to try it on me. It goes on very smooth, not too thick, and not watery. The texture is important.  I don't want a greasy layer on my skin but it has to be rich enough to give my skin a layer of protection.  The bonus is that it has SPF and has anti-wrinkle ingredients for the days when I don't use a Retinol product but want anti-aging properties at work on my face.  This product keeps my face from the flakiness I was experiencing with another product I used to use because it more than combats the dryness that Retinol brings. It feels cool and spreads well. It absorbs quickly and  I don't feel it on my hands afterward.  I like that it has no discernable scent. Women use so many beauty products and they all have different scents that don't always work well together. I like my skin and hair products scent free so I can wear my favorite perfume and not have a cacophony of smells mixing together. The price point of this product is excellent also. You don't have to spend a lot to get a great product if you use the right product. This is one I'll be using for a very long time. My skin is super sensitive, combination, and very acne-prone, so I'm very careful about what goes on my skin.  The way I switch to a new product is this: on the right side of my face, I use my usual lotion.  On the left, I use the new lotion.  I do this for about a month before switching to the new lotion, unless the new lotion causes a severe reaction.  This allows me to systematically test whether or not the new lotion is actually better, as well as control for hormone swings/cycles.For reference, my old lotion is Garnier Moisture Rescue for Normal/Combo Skin. The Eucerin is thicker than the gel-cream texture of the Garnier, and while neither has an overwhelming scent, the Garnier has a stronger scent.  The Eucerin absorbs more slowly, and doesn't spread as easily as the Garnier, but the skin feels softer when it's absorbed.**Day One**:The Eucerin side feels softer to the touch, and actually seems less greasy after a night of sleep than the Garnier side.  No visible difference in pore size, acne, or fine lines (yet).My initial impression of the Eucerin is good--I like that it feels softer, yet less greasy, and the SPF and the fact that it doesn't have a scent are two huge positives.**UPDATE: 8/1/15--Day Three**The Eucerin continues to make the left side of my face feel softer than the Garnier on the right.  To make sure I wasn't imagining it, I asked my boyfriend to tell me if he could feel a difference between the two sides of my face, without telling him which side was which, and he also said that the left side was softer.I'm now noticing a subtle difference in texture between the two sides as well.  Those fine lines that they're talking about do seem lighter with the Eucerin (tested by making a surprised face and then seeing how long it took for the expression lines to fade).I've had a breakout this morning as well, and noticed something unexpected.  The breakout is actually worse on the Garnier side (both number and redness of bumps).  I would have expected the Eucerin to be worse since it's new, and I've not experienced an increase in breakouts from the Garnier as opposed to my older lotion.  But, for some reason, the Eucerin side of my face isn't as broken out as the Garnier side, to the point where I have a very obvious and comical line down the middle of my face that marks where the clear skin ends.  I think I'm going to have a hard time going a full month without switching over completely, but I'll try to soldier on, just in case.**UPDATE 8/13/15**  Ok, I've hit my limit.  I'm officially switching to the Eucerin.  My skin is calmer, my fine lines have all but disappeared, and it continues to make my skin softer than the Garnier moisturizer.  I'm throwing in the towel on the Garnier--this stuff is my new moisturizer."
100,B0000535UT,"If you have the problem with the the tea tree smell taking over a room or your home, and opening windows donsent help. Place a cup of white distilled Vinegar  in the middle of the room.Works best if the room is heated or it's hot summer day.Also product ingredients stat that the last ingredient  is a fragrance! It does not say what that fragrance is. The tea tree ingredient  is in the middle and is a tea tree leaf oil not a fragrance.Don't expect  a product to smell like  a tea tree just because  it Says tea tree on it.Just like different type of roses in a garden  look and smell different even tho they are all roses. Just becuase a few people write reviews saying they don't like the smell or taste,  thats their option  and you need to take into account  that they may have not read the label correctly.Also some ingredients are organic on new label. Scent too strong, otherwise fine I order this, aloe vera and tea tree varieties,  and they are the best.  The high incidence of failed locking bottle caps,  ~1 in 10, requires me to save the cap from previous bottles and swap them. Wish I saw a review like this before I purchased since one like it are buried under the others. Overall I have no complaints about packaging or the way the product felt on my skin. I just got it today and used it the once but think I will return it. The reason being there is not even a slight smell of tea tree. It smells like baby powder or like old lady perfume? Thought when I ordered a TEA TREE body wash it would smell like it, you know? If you like smelling like baby powder then this would definitely be a good body wash for you as it does feel cleansing, but if you were looking for soap that actually smells even a little of tea tree then I’d suggest getting a different product. Love this product had some issues with acne on my back..this product received me of the acne on my back..Great smell and luxurious lather, it is definitely in my daily routine and would highly recommend. Smells so good and very thick..lathers nicely. This body wash would be perfect but for the scent. It smells like roses and I enjoy how roses smell but it is overpowering in this product. Why can't they just leave out the fragrance with stuff like this?  Don't most of us have and use our own colognes and perfumes? It gets you clean but it doesn't smell like tea tree which is what I was looking for."
101,B0009V8N5E,"The reason I did not give it 5 stars, is because it does have a bit of a smell and I have to reapply a lot more to keep my tan on... Nothing horrible, however when I see a 5 star rating, I think ""perfect"", without any defects. I have used more expensive tanning products that are not as great as this. As a matter of fact, I haven't found one that is better than this, (yet). I'm sure there is a better product though. But as long as this stuff is being sold at this price, I will continue to use faithfully without shopping around. I'm very pale, (if I red hair I would be a ginger) lol. I have freckles, blue eyes, the whole pale girl package! The only thing I do not have is light colored hair. I have dark hair, so I really need some color on me! I have pretty much made a career out of trying tanning products. Very few can I actually use without being turned orange. This does not turn me orange. It is a subtle, yet darkish, nice brown color. Also another product I like is a cheapy sold at Walmart. It's a hemp glow lotion. (Takes a week for the full color). I like to mix the two together and use them. I actually mix them with even amounts and apply. I have used the sun labs alone, its just because im so pale, if I use it alone in one step, I'm like 20x darker in a few minutes, vs mixing it with other moisturizers and taking a few days to a week to get full color. I just don't like stepping out and people immediately knowing im fake LOL. Not to mention, I make less mistakes if I do just a tad of color at a time. Gives you room to play with, and every day you can correct small mistakes from the day before, as you slowly get darker.  Just my 2 cents on this product anyway :)Tips : Mix this with moisturizer (equal parts), or another glow lotion.Make a habit of shaving daily, exfoliating, and moisturizing. I know this sounds like a lot of work, and it is! But, when you use self tanners, you have to take the extra time to take care of and prep your skin so that it looks great. 9 times out of ten, errors from self tanners are made just from not having properly hydrated and smooth skin. When you have dry patches, it causes the lotion to absorb at different rates and such which therefore causes uneven color.  Not much you can do about streaks, unless you tan slowly (by mixing, or using a daily glow lotion which takes several days). With those, you can easily correct small mistakes the day after and its very unlikely that you'll miss the same areas several days in a row. I have never had a streak after a few days of tanning slower, vs using a full strength tanner in one sitting.  The worst thing that has happened to me in trying tanning products, is that I have ended up orange, but at least my tan was even and smooth! LOL! Nothings worse than orange, AND streaky.I suggest trying this anyway. I used the medium shade. It is dark enough for me because im so pale. Another mistake people make is using one that is too dark for them. Anytime I go even a tad to dark for my skin tone, I end up a rusty color :( Just another thing to keep in mind.  Enjoy! I like to use this on my legs when I'm going out for a big night and I'm wearing shorts or a skirt. It gives me extra confidence, like wearing make up on my face. I shave my legs first, then exfoliate, then apply. I think it goes on really quickly and dries quickly as well. It dries well I'm doing the rest of my getting ready. It doesn't have a scent. I won’t bother repeating what most of the positive reviews already say-  great color, easy to apply, natural not orange color etc. What I will say is that yes, the bronzer does rinse off -  I tan in the evenings, and in the morning the bronze color guide rinses away…it’s supposed to. That’s not your tan you see going down the drain…it’s the color guide. The tan color/stain will be left behind.  And mostly-  use two mitts (or gloves), and IF YOU USE MITTS, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE ONES WITH THUMBS!  Seriously. It makes a HUGE difference in application because you have more control than the ones withOUT the thumbs.  I’ve been using sunless tanners for nearly 30 years (YES, they’ve been around that long!) and they have come a really long way over the years.  This is one of the better ones in my opinion- as someone with fair skin…skin that is ultra sensitive and breakout prone. I’ve never had an issue with this brand.Side note*. Since I tan at night, there is usually some pinkish tan color on my light colored sheets, but it’s never stained my sheets… it washes right out, even in cold water.  👍🏻👍🏻 I've used quite a few self tanners in the past few years because it's really the only way I can tan with my weird skin (super pale yet also Mediterranean, so I have to basically lay in direct sunlight for hours before I even start to tan) - this is my new go-to.I decided to order this because I found a list of the best sunless tanners for 2014, and this one was the only reasonably priced and widely available option near the top. I got this as an add-on item, so I was really happy with the price.The pump is totally useless. I don't know if my bottle became pressurized during shipping or what. It comes with the pump locked down - I gave it a slight half-twist to unlock it, and the pump head shot off like a rocket, ricocheted off the ceiling, and landed in my toilet. I washed it off and tried to snap it back down, but it wasn't happening. On top of that, I noticed that the lotion was being pulled out onto the sides of the pump stem when I moved it up and down (very messy), so I gave up, locked the pump back down, and just unscrewed the top and poured.I was pretty skeptical at first because this stuff is VERY dark right out of the bottle - it looks like chocolate syrup. But it rubs in really evenly, absorbs quickly, and actually smells really pleasant (kind of fruity). That was all a major relief because I've definitely used a few self tanners that just kind of sit on top of your skin for hours, smelling like death the whole time.It does start to stain your hands very quickly - I did one leg, scrubbed my hands with soap and water, then did the other leg, scrubbed my hands with soap and water, and so on. I'd definitely recommend either wearing gloves or doing one area at a time and scrubbing off in between. I didn't end up with any hand stains the next day.The color went through a few stages for me. (Again, might just be my weird skin.) When I first rubbed it in, it was invisible. After about 15 minutes it started to turn a pinky-orange color, and I was like, ""Oh-god-what-have-I-done?"" I *almost* washed it off, but instead I just decided to see what would happen and went to bed. I slept for about seven hours, and when I woke up in the morning, it was back to looking invisible. I showered but didn't exfoliate, and went to work. When I got home nine hours later, I inspected again, and it had turned into a pretty natural-looking, even tan.It's a little more orange than a natural tan would be on me, but only a little. I was surprised at how even and noticeable-yet-subtle it ended up being since it was so dark right out of the bottle. I'm sure you can build it up to be darker with a few more days of application, but one was enough for me. Overall I'm really happy with it (though I will probably transfer it to a bottle with a better pump), and I'll buy this again when I run out. I had trepidations that a self tanner would look unnatural, but I was happy to see that a dab of this product provides a natural-looking glow that's not too dark. I have purchased this product multiple times now.  This is the best self tanning lotion that I have ever used. I have olive skin, and this did not create much of a ""tan"". I was disappointed."
102,B0000535RA,"I got this because I wanted to start a skincare routine and was interested in the alpha and beta hydroxy acids. This thing does not disappoint. I'm a long-time Seabreeze and Biore witch hazel user, but I prefer this one by far. I've been using it for a few months now and it has greatly improved the look and feel of my skin. The ONLY downsides are it can cause some skin flaking (particularly around the nose for me) and also seems to agitate dirt/oils under the skin without fully pulling them up to the surface, which is annoying. When I first used it it caused a few clogged pores to become zits, but it was fine because they were then treatable and not stuck in my skin. There's two small spots now that are just permanently under my skin and not coming up, I'll likely get some microneedle pimple patches for them. BUT other than that it's seriously amazing, 100% recommend Used this for a long time and have found no comparison Works well. I love how this fight readiness and promotes healing of post acne!! I love this product. I'm 45 and have my share of sun spots on my face. But after using this, not only are they fading, but my wrinkles don't look as deep, and my pores are indeed smaller. I used to use l'oreal, but I keep coming back to neutrogena. I've used this before, it's a decent toner. Doesn't make my skin feel like it's on fire, so that's a plus. Pore refining? Eh maybe, I haven't ever seen a difference really but it's still a decent toner. Great for your face,Let’s you feel fresh and clean. The smell is kind of strong but okay.The product is amazing.I have extra sebum production and slightly acne prone skin, and this is a life saver. If I have a pimple coming in, I will soak a cotton bud or some tissue in this and let it rest on my skin for probably way too long, but it is SUPER effective at reducing how long I have to deal with the pimple and redness.If I remove sebum from my pores, I will do the same thing: soak a cotton bud or tissue in this and let it rest until it has evaporated.I do get a slight burning sensation because my skin is super sensitive, but I don't have to deal with any lingering redness the next day from irritated skin. (Both because of removing stuff from my skin with force, and use of the product.)I love this stuff so much.Cons: Do not apply close to your nostrils or eyes though. It will sting and irritate them. Try to avoid breathing in a lot of the fumes, for the same reason.If you have sensitive skin, like I do, do a patch test in a couple different areas, to be safe."
103,B000XJ0PG2,"Cream was ok but didn't get what was offered.  Ordered a 4 pack and only got a 2 pack.  Instead of going to the trouble of returning decided to keep it and not order in the future again.  Will go to anot reliable source. Disappointed I originally found this product a few years ago at Big Lots. It was the best face cream that I had ever bought. I bought jars and jars of it because as Big Lots says: ""Once it's gone, it's gone!I finally ran out of the good stuff last month and was hanging on to the last drops of it at the bottom of a jar, when I decided that maybe I could find something similar online.I was surprised to find out that it was still being produced by the ""same"" company in a slightly different labeled jar. Now, my question was...Was this the same product or had someone bought them out and kept the same name? I had to try it out so I bought 3 jars, because you never know when the good stuff will be out of your reach. (haha) Well, when I opened the jar I had to test the smell first and it seemed similar and then I put it on my face and it smoothed on the same, but there was a bit of a difference. I could tell that the ""new"" good stuff had more emollients in it, meaning that it made my skin oily and shiny after a few minutes. The original Collagen cream never made my skin oily. It just made it feel fresh and invigorating after each use and I could feel it working, so to speak.Well, I'm okay with the oiliness of the new face cream, since it is wintertime, but in the summer it may be a problem and I may have to use less of it to avoid being too shiny in the heat. I was really happy with the original cream, but I am also happy to know that the new cream does STILL do the same thing that the original did and that's keeping my face moisturized and very supple and soft.I've only tried the first jar of the 3, so hopefully the other 2 jars aren't worse with the emollients since they will be sitting for a while waiting to get used. It's really not a bad thing, but it reminds me of when I was younger and my face naturally was oily on its own and I had a hard time with acne. I don't have acne anymore, and I hope using the new good stuff doesn't perpetuate any negative situations.I use a very good exfoliating face wash and astringent, so keeping my pores unclogged will make the difference, when using this version of the Collagen Beauty Cream.Overall, I'm ecstatically happy to find my most favorite face cream ever, again. Thanks Amazon for helping me to find it! I was on a road trip about 15 years ago when I discovered Masons Collagen. I have super sensitive skin plus I’m allergic to fragrance so my choices are very few.  I was very fortunate to find this in a grocery store. No one can get my age right, they guess that I’m 15 years younger than 59! It’s as if Masons stopped the aging process for me. I swear buy it!! I have used this for over a year and have found it to leave my skin smooth and nourished. I would recommend this for purchase.  Good buy for the price LOVE this cream!  I happened upon this cream at a local grocery store and for the price, thought to give it a try. I loved it.  I was bummed when they discontinued carrying it and was happy to have found it here on Amazon.  This is my second time purchasing here.  I can't attest to any Collagen claims, but I will say it feels creamy and beautiful on my face.  I feel very moisturized and the price is right.I could buy a carton of this, if it weren't for expiration dates. I just received this January 20, 2021 and the expiration is June 2022 (yes, I will use it well before then).  Mason, please don't discontinue this product.  I'll be back.  :) I use this as a moisturizer and it works pretty well, but the first time I used it, I went way too hard in the paint and slathered it all over my face and it caused me to break out a little (nothing to drastic, but not as clear as my skin has been). Note that I have combination skin (what's oily is very oily and what is dry is suuuper dry). I quickly adjusted and have been instead using this over my dry patches and where I have wrinkles only, and it's been working well as a moisturizer, although I haven't noted any reduction in wrinkles (which, as another reviewer noted, is not what topical collagen is supposed to do). It's labeled as being ""pear"" scented, which I would say is fairly accurate with some more floral undertones and the scent is not overpowering. I would recommend trying this product, especially considering the price point, but don't have your expectations too high. I have sensitive skin and I get rash on the face with others products bur and collagen makes my face feel soft and good. Really like the product! I’ve been using this for about 4 years and I can tell a big difference! Just know this, when you put it on at night, after your shower, you can tell it is working immediately! Your skin comes alive! I swear! I’m hooked! And the smell is very refreshing and light!"
104,B000GCQ04C,"I’ve got sensitive skin and have to be careful not to dry it out but also keep pores clean. I’ve tried all sorts of products to moisturize and keep pimples away. Skip all those complicated routines. I use this to gently scrub my t zone after a mild cleanser and follow with a moisturizer. I use with Cera Ve cleansers/moisturizes and my skin has never been better. If I do get a hormonal break out, dabbing this in the problem area a few times throughout the day helps to clear it up. This natural toner is a good value for the money. I like that it’s pure and fragrance free. I also tried the moisturizing scented one and I didn’t like it. It wasn’t as high in witch hazel purity and it stunk like cheap perfume. This one is the best. So glad I found it. I wanted a timer to help with my oily and acne prone skin. I read the reviews and thought I’d give this a try. I noticed a difference after one day!!! My skin felt to clean but not dry. I have used so many products and most dry my skin out. This feels so cool and refreshing on your face. Does not leave a residue and doesn’t sting or dry it out. Plus I can already see that it’s helping with my large clogged pores.The smell isn’t the best but it fades quickly. I’m looking forward to seeing what extended use will do for my skin. Para mi piel grasosa y sensible es increíble, no solo retira el maquillaje, me balancea el pH de la piel, no me la deja seca ni grasosa después de usarla, es comedogenico y a pesar de que he sido torpe desmaquillandome los ojos no me a irritado en lo absoluto, claro que hay que tener precaución pero ni una sola molestia o irritación ocular. Para las personas con piel grasosa y sensible, este es el producto, igualmente dice que es para todo tipo de piel! I have not used it yet, but the scent is not fragrance-free. The scent is Witch Hazel LOL. The other reviews mentioned the smell. I am not a fan of which hazel. One fragrance that I really dislike is witch hazel but I bought this because of the reviews of how great it works.Update-- I really like this product. I mentioned the smell was pretty bad because I am not a fan of witch hazel but it does not smell like witch hazel on my face. The witch hazel fragrance smells more inside the bottle. I do not know how they do it but I am thankful it does not smell like it on my face. Now there is a light fragrance but it reminds me of the other fragrance-free products. Okay, so people will legit go on tick Tok probably and rail against witch hazel. However, this stuff legit brought a GLOW to my face - I’m the girl in the pic - and let me tell you, this stuff cleared my skin.It also made it soft and shrunk my pores. Idc what anyone says. This stuff is going to be a staple in my routine till Jesus comes. This is a staple product that never gets old and is always in my beauty stash. I use it for toning and tightening pores after washing my face. I also use it to remove excess dirt or soap and to remove make-up, and to hydrate and refresh the skin after washing, or for a quick cleanse. It may be drying for some skin types and may sting skin that has abrasions; so, it might be best to test an area of your skin first to see how it reacts and if need-be, maybe skip a day or so if you can't use it everyday. I like that the brand has been around a long time and the ingredients are all natural. It refreshes, cleanses, tightens, and tones. A great product to have on hand! I have this to tone my pores almost my whole life. My Mom used it before me. My daughter came home and I was giving her a facial and she had never used it. So thus was a purchase for her. I don't go knew day without using it. used as an after shave to condition and soothe irritation"
105,B000056W74,I use this just as the directions say. I rub all over my body while my skin is still dripping wet after showers. I also changed my ENTIRE collection of body care to sweet scents because this smelled so good. (I use the mocha scents from bath and body works). Love how soft my skin is when I use this! Me gusto este producto me ha ayudado a humectar la piel un poco y su olor es bueno. Pero pienso que le falta más humectante y que su olor perdure. Sin embargo por el precio está posicionado en  escala 8 para mí. Tienes un buen tamaño y la piel lo absorbe muy rápido. I use this when I get out of the shower. It keeps skin soft and moisturized without an oily feel or residue. I love Palmers products and this body oil is a dream! Keeps my skin silky smooth. The scent is great and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling extremely greasy. I do not like the scent of baby oil so of course this smells just like it.  It does work though but leaves me feeling a bit greasy still after over an hour.  Will keep using when I have winter dry skin  but will see if brand has a scented option Great for slathering on after bathing. Flows over the skin and deep moisturizes with a delicate scent. All of this at a great price point. I use it in different ways but I love it I use it as soon as I get out of the shower. It kept my skin moisturized all day and soft. A little goes a long way
106,B000NURPK0,"Less Shea than the original formula and does not have the cocoa butter scent it has before. Still moisturizes,,, but not as good as before. I bought this for my roommate and he really liked the scent and the smoothness . Good for the money. This lotion is okay, but not as good as the original. The company changed the formula. I compared the new container and the original container ingredients side by side.  This lotion also does not absorb into the skin like the original formula.  This one has to be rubbed and rubbed to make it disappear into the skin.  I preferred the original lotion.  I am guessing that this company like many companies are going cheaper. Having been using for a couple years & love it! Suave Cocoa Butter Shea Body Lotion Unisex...I have skin that is sensitive to many products. This product is one I can use without repercussion. After a severe allergic skin reaction, when I listed items I can use without a problem,  I was told by my dermatologist that  this lotion is one of the best skin care products on the market. I highly recommend this body lotion. I just like"
107,B0009MHJE4,"I like the product. It makes your skin soft. It is just a little sticky. I was a bit skeptical when I first read about all the uses of African Shea Butter. As someone with chronic skin issues (extremely dry skin on arms/legs, combination dry/oily skin on face), thinning hair, and old scars, I'm used to applying a variety of different products to treat each corresponding issue. I thought, how in the world can just ONE product be used to treat EVERYTHING?! It seemed too good to be true. It's as if though African Shea Butter is some kind of magical potion or something. However, this is also what attracted me to the product, because it can get quite tedious and time consuming having to apply different products to treat different issues.After using it just a few days (applied nightly to face, arms/legs, and hair), I can say that I am truly impressed! Because the product feels like an oil/butter it was a little scary applying it to the face at first, because I was afraid I might end up with a few zits. However, I didn't break out at all and instead, found that my skin has gotten tighter, while discolored spots on my face have disappeared! Perhaps the biggest surprise of all though, was seeing acne scars left over from my teenage years finally start to fade away! In addition, the ""ashy skin"" on my arms and legs has completely smoothed out, and my hair feels fuller and thicker.I have been getting tattoo removal treatments, and after each treatment, I'm supposed to apply some kind of antibiotic such as Neosporin to help with the healing process. After having another treatment done just yesterday, I decided to further put the Shea Butter to the test and apply it to the treated area, as opposed to applying Neosporin. The results have been fantastic! The treated area has started to heal a lot faster than normal, and the short-term, mild pain that comes after each tattoo removal treatment is completely gone!Overall, this product has totally surprised and impressed me. I love the convenience of being able to use just one product for all of my issues. Needless to say, the time I used to spend on treating my skin and hair has been cut down substantially. A lot of my skin/hair issues are hereditary, as my Mom has a lot of the same issues. Therefore, I'm definitely gonna recommend she try this. I know there's probably no such thing as a magic potion, but this is about as close as you get! I purchased mine as a Prime item, sold by Nature and Herbs. It arrived quickly and in a container with a lid that was VERY secure. This is my second purchase of shea butter and I think I prefer this one over the"
108,B0011UR1H8,"Have always loved products from Australian Gold and this one is just as superb. Amazing smell and instant results. Best tanning product, nice brown tan, received  it 3 days earlier, thank you Goes on great not too thick nor runny. It has good color Product works quick if you regularly tan, smells good, doesn’t stain palms of hands, all around good quality for price. These reviews do not lie... I am IN LOVE with this tanning lotion.1. As everyone has said, yes, it applies like an actual lotion. It's light, easy to spread, & soaks into the skin quickly. Plus, it leaves the skin feeling hydrated & near matte- no sticky or greasy residue like with other lotions.2. I'd say I'm a person who is exactly between someone who easily tans and someone who easily burns. Getting that first bit of base tan is always hardest for me. I can burn easily during that period. With that being said, I used this lotion today in a tanning bed for 15 mins (my very first session in a long, long time), and I'm already loving my color! I can already tell that I'm darker after just one time in the bed using this lotion! My chest might have gotten a bit red, as it always does when tanning for the first few times, but other than that I have skipped the dreaded sunburn phase already! I can't wait to build upon it!3. The value... are you serious? What an amazing price! Waaaaaaaaay cheaper than you'll find in the salons!4. The scent isn't bad, but it's a bit too fruity for my taste. It's sweet smelling, which is not something I favor. But it's definitely not bad smelling, and for that I am grateful.5. If you're wary about buying a lotion with a built in bronzer, don't be! I was too! But it's so subtle that there aren't any streaks or mistakes. It's really foolproof!...so stop reading this & just buy it already! (Or don't... maybe it won't ever run out of stock and the price will stay low that way 😉) So far this has been the best tan out of the 22 different taning lotions we've tried. I've had this lotion before and loved it.This time though it was questionable on the integrity of the product... received a bottle with tape around the top as a seal? Never had this happen before. Time will tell if the product is legit. Golden brown never looked so goodHaving fair skin can be a curse like no other, especially during the summer months. While all of my friends are golden brown goddesses, I am over here blinding America with my pasty, white, ghostly skin. Unfortunately, this is not an exaggeration (my boyfriend calls me his “Pasty Pastry”) but THANKFULLY this product came to my rescue!Features at a Glance:• Bronzer• Oils hydrate the skin• Indoor and Outdoor usePros:• Great size bottle, fits in any bag• Fast results!• Yummy smell• Amazing priceCons:• Bronzer can leave marks if you’re not carefulMy Opinion:Like I mentioned above, I’m all too familiar with milky white skin. I finally put my foot down and said enough is enough, it’s time to get tan! After doing a lot of research, I found this product and decided to give it a shot.I purchased this product for indoor tanning (don’t judge me) so I could achieve a base tan before my Caribbean vacation. After 2 short tanning sessions I started seeing results! I was able to achieve an adorable golden glow before it was time to fly away.Typically, I am suckered into buying lotions from the tanning salon, however I did my research and saved tons of money with this purchase. Who wants to spend $80 on lotion when you can spend less than $20 for the same quality product! Plus, I personally think this had a much more pleasant smell than other “high end” lotions.Where to buy:"

110,B00168538E,"I had my doubts when I bought this product.  I have had severe acne throughout my teen years up to my 20s.  After two courses of Accutane my skin has finally become manageable.  I still suffer from the occasional cyst here and there especially on my forehead.  My forehead is an oil rig, it never stops pumping oil.  When it gets really oily (towards the end of the day) my forehead gets really itchy and I always break out in cysts. I needed something natural that would soothe and heal my skin, kill the bacteria and  minimize oil production.  I had my doubts when I came across this product because it contained essential oils.  I thought it would add oil to my already oily skin, boy was I wrong.  It contains Witch Hazel and natural grain alcohol along with the essential oils so when it comes out there's absolutely no oily residue.  I have to admit it has a strong smell from all the extracts it contains but it's bearable and eventually fades after a few minutes.  My skin care routine is as follows, I was my face with Dessert Essence Thoroughly clean face wash, apply Dessert Essence Daily Essential face moisturizer with jojoba, I wait a few minutes and then I apply the Blemish touch stick to my oily areas (my forehead, nose) and that's it.  I Just roll a thin layer covering my entire forehead and nose.  It feels great when I apply it on my skin and most importantly it does it's job.  It heals red spots, browns spots, prevents new cysts and pustules from forming and reduces oil.  I wish I found this product sooner but I'm glad I finally did.  It's great for acne suffers because it not only fights breakouts but it nourishes and heals the skin NATURALLYIf you have severe oil production like me this product is a god send for us, please give it a try you won't be disappointed.  This is coming from a guy who suffered through hell with his skin.  Thank you Dessert Essence for making such great products that actually work and are all natural.take care I cannot express how GREAT this product is!! I have suffered from acne ever since I was a teen (thanks, Dad!) just like my father did, and we both still do. For years I only used products that were FILLED with chemicals, at one point even taking antibiotics! Nothing worked. One day, I did some research and learned that all the chemicals I was using could be making my acne worse! The chemicals can irritate the skin even more AND they strip your face of natural oils that can help keep your acne ""at bay"". About a year ago, I decided to go more natural, and bought Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash, and wow! Using that, I would still get TINY little pimples. I started to use a moisturizer, it made my face worse. I HIGHLY recommend this product with Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash. I use the Wash once a day, and use this stick 3 times a day. The directions say 5 to 6 times a day, but that is way too much. The product has new packaging, and arrives as a glass container with a rollerball at the top, so no need to touch your face! You just roll it over WHATEVER blemish you have on your face (pimples, cold sores, blackheads, etc.) or anywhere on your body you may have something (bug bites, cuts, etc.) and this powerful antiseptic does it's job. When I first apply it, my blemishes briefly gets redder for a few minutes as the liquid gets into where it needs to go and starts to kill the bad stuff. I apply when I wake up, once in the afternoon, and right before bed. It kills whatever you may have WITHOUT drying it out like other products do. It briefly smells a little bad, but who cares as long as it goes away fast and clears up your skin. Use this!! I was a little reluctant when I purchased this. I'm not sure why I was so reluctant but I'm guessing it was because I have tried SO MANY products to help my skin. I have never in my life had acne, but at 33 it started and oh my it hurts. I have fair skin with freckles across my nose for those that wonder about skin type. Some of the places on my face get cystic with hard knots under the skin, they get soooooo red and irritated and when they finally start to go down they leave a big scar. I recently had two of them on my forehead that were very very painful, red and as gross as this is to admit they leaked ( horrifying )  so I couldn't hide any of it with make up. So I tried this and I while I will admit that I have a lot of products that I try I truly believe this is what helped. It took about a week and one lump is GONE and the other can no longer be seen and you can feel that its much smaller however it's still there. I didn't want to write a review until I knew if this product worked or not and I was surprised at how fast I got a result. I was so happy with the results on my forehead after just a week, that I decided to go ahead and write this. Not everything will work the same for everyone But this worked for me and has a great smell that's rather relaxing. Caution it burns at first be prepared! I have been using this bad boy for 10+ years on all my blemishes, and my nose area to keep free of blackheads! It smells exactly like Tea Tree Oil (Bc it is... try to familiarize yourself with that scent before you purchase) The scent was very strong for me, but it is so worth it. Tea Tree Oil is a natural antiseptic, so it works great for open pimples or pimples yet to be popped. This is an amazing formula, Bc 100% Tea Tree is too strong to use on your face (you might get a burning sensation), so this is a mix of Tea Tree & Witch Hazel which also helps with redness and inflammation. I use to have cystic acne (and I still do tbh) but that god it is way better now Bc of Tea Tree! I carry this with me since it is so tiny, yet so powerful. I love that it's convenient to carry and use on the go. Stuff is good for few number of things. Great for my grandkids"
111,B000RTPT8M,"Started using this moisturizer years ago and never disappointed. It does not feel oily as do many others.  You have a clean feeling under foundation, but even when I’m not going out, I use it at home. I have used this for years love how it makes my face and neck feel. I have been using this for more than 35 years. I love it. It’s a wonderful product. loved it I've used it for years and never had a problem, even though I have very sensitive skin. I've used this lotion for many many years and it's the only one that I've found that actually works on my face.  I've literally said I can feel the relief on my skin after use.  Would recommend it to anyone. I've used this for years. Can't survive the Midwest winter without it A classic staple of my skincare routine!"
112,B0017DGOE0,"Just opened package and lid was off and some of the product had leaked out. Probably will order elsewhere. Not a cheap product and would prefer to not lose money from product just spilling. Glad to have an exfoliator that doesn’t make my sensitive skin even more red. To be fair, I've been a fan of Eminence for quite some time.To begin:  I'm in my late 20s with mostly oily, but sometimes dry skin, slightly acne prone.  I've used this product for about two years, following it with a emulsified Excellent exfoliating wash!  I have used it before, after purchasing it from the salon where I get facials.  It is a little drying if you use it every day, but I usually switch between this product and a few other eminence products.  The only small issue is sometimes the wash gets clogged.  A few times I had to squeeze the bottle extra hard to get the wash to come out, and then a ton did resulting in waste.  I have cleaned out the nozzle a few times because there appears to be a lot of dried wash in there.  I keep the lid snapped, so I do not know why it would get hardened.  I have used many other eminence products and never experienced this.  Overall, still it's a great product and it was a little bit cheaper than what I would have paid in the salon. It's good to revisit the product that won me to Eminence 11 years ago. The lime-like scent is faint and thus not overbearing, the exfoliation granules are small and gentle, and overall it treats my skin well. It makes for a good first step to great skin care regiment. so. once it arrived..I think I liked it.not sure if its because I am so gummed up from coconut cream and brightening lotion.Maybe Its the online thing, but my skin. does not love these products.I dd also get the Hungarian mask..It was as I remembered.but all in all...go to your professional.  somethimg not right. I ordered the same stuff. my face feels like a greasy mess..kinda think I need  new brand.Also make sure you look at sizes  Mine came in a travel size...Thought I was buying a 10 to 12 oz... got something like a 3oz ..$13 later my bad. but watch. Gentle exfoliating beads.Lime scent.It was my first time trying this product and I really like to mix up my Eminence cleansers so I thought I'd try this one. My face feels very refreshed after I use the product. I use it every 4 days or so just for a light exfoliator.I will definitely order from 123 Skincare again. There was a shortage in product when I placed my order and they emailed me to let me know it would be a bit late. They offered a full refund if I wanted it but because I was in no rush for my order, I didn't mind the extra couple days that it took to be delivered. It came opened in the package so some of it came out. was pretty messy..☹"
113,B0009F3O8Q,"I can't believe people on here complained about the smell being too strong. It's cocoa butter and I specifically bought it for the smell.  It smells just as good as the Lubriderm brand but costs about half. And I can't find the Lubriderm with cocoa butter in Canada anymore. It arrived quickly and I tried some right away. It smells like hot chocolate and the cream is very thick.  You only need a small amount for your hands and it moisturizes them perfectly without any greasiness. Plus it has vitamin E.  I ordered the pack of 3  so it should last me a while. I may even bring a bottle to keep in my locker at work. And I will likely order more once it runs out. I've tried this lotion before and I love it!. It's a thicker consistency but is not greasy and dries rather fast which I personally love. A little goe a long way, this lotion does its job and very well. And bonus it smells great too! I've had people tell me it smells like vanilla when I have it on but I personally thing it smells like chocolate or hot coco 😋 Great moisturizer with a really good scent! A favorite product , however, this delivery the product seem to be old and or possibly house in a very cold storage area as it is unable to go through the pump. It is still usable, but extremely thick, this is a first. Otherwise I recommend this product I love the way it makes my skin feel.. it’s not oily at all. I am very happy with this product that I use on my body. like GOOD chocolate too... I love this lotion. It helps with my Psoriasis, Excema and Dermatitis. BUT, the pumps to pump the lotion out suck. They break and if you take the tops off you can't get all the lotion out of the bottles. You need to fix the packaging. If that's fixed I will change my rating to  5 stars. I started using this and it’s ok. I still get dry skin from the waist down, even when I pair it with the Palmer’s balm in the jar. I really like the scent and it’s not greasy. The balm in the jar is greasy.Update: I did the subscribe and save and got a second bottle. The bottom of my box was opened and taped back up with clear tape. Idk if this is a thing that Amazon did, but if it was, I’ll unsubscribe for now.Another update: I just started using the second bottle I purchased and the nozzle was broken. Go figure. I won’t be purchasing this again."
114,B000OO7546,"This stuff is phenomenal, I use this to moisturize my baby's skin, especially his diaper area. Also, when my son had diaper rash, this healed that delicate skin. If your skin is really dry, apply to skin while damp, your skin will thank you. This stuff is gold if your skin is dry and you want something natural. I got This as a non toxic alternative to applying Vaseline to my lips every night. It makes my lips soft and hydrated and doesn’t cause any sort of irritation. perfect alternative to petroleum jelly, cleaner feeling, no scent to speak of, just nice clean layer of protection Worked great for my son's circumcision! Many years ago a Doctor told me to put a little bit Vaseline in my nostrils when going to bed as I had wound up in the hospital for 4 days at one point due to my issue.  However, recently I read NOT to use Vaseline as it was petroleum which meant petroleum could wind up in your lungs if used as the Doctor recommended.  So I searched a NON-Petroleum product and found Alba Botanica.  Well, It worked GREAT!  It's works EXACTLY the same as Vaseline, a great moisturizer, is odorless and is very cost effective.  I've also used it on other irritated spots which it also worked just as well.I gave it 5 stars on all counts.  As far as 5 stars on SCENT... I gave that to the product since it did NOT have a scent.  I would recommend Alba Botanica to anyone interested in using a NON-Petroleum moisturizing jelly. Bought this on the recommendation of my chiropractor (I know, random) for my daughter’s nosebleeds. We use it in her nose every night and it seems to be helping. I also started using it on myself as a salve of sorts, mostly on my dry lips. Recently I had an eczema breakout on my right hand, concentrated on my thumb. I was using the steroid ointment from my dermatologist and it was doing nothing. The burning, itching, cracking, and bleeding were reaching a new level. I decided to try this ointment on it and just a few days later it has improved SO much! It’s not completely gone, but it’s only been a couple days so I plan to use it more regularly and see if it will go away. I’m just happy for some relief, even if it’s not completely gone.I’ve had no issue with the packaging as others have, but I also only use a very small amount at a time so no aggressive tube squeezing over here. Soothing with no harmful petroleum ingredient. What the hell!  Product is great but I had a terrible time opening the thing. Then when I finally did get it open, I could never get it back on.  Now I keep it in a plastic bag.  I'm going to try a different product and hope the product is as good - but I gotta be able to open and close it this time!"
115,B000T7P0KO,"I am 39 years old, I have been getting facials for 20 years, used every product to mankind from AHAs, retinol, vit c, etc.  I begad glycolic acid peels in my late 20s, being a nurse, I am very well informed about different great products. I began botoxing my forehead in my late 20s and have done doctor chemical peels for 10 years...  I got tired of spending soooo much money of glycolic creams that were a fortune with far less glycolic content than this cream.  I LOVE this cream!!! I bought 3 months ago and use daily.  Here is what I love...Glycolic acid to me is still the only formula that rejuvenates skin to look dewey and fresh and YOUNG...People say I look 30, and I think it is because I have been using glycolic acid on my face like a religion, nothing peels and resurfces skin better with removing dead cells than glycolic.  I am not a doctor, but just my EXPERIENCE...REtinol is great for age spots but so is glycolic and retinol is terrible if you even have the littlest bit of sun on your face you look like a tomato.  This product, within days made the surface of my skin look great and QUARTER OF THE COST! After years of facials, I began doing all this stuff at home when I just copied what they were doing at the doctors office and at the spa.  Glycolic acid 10% is sooo hard to find in a product.  I did use a daily 15% but it is much more money and I dont see much of a difference.  If you HAVE NEVER USED glycolic acid on your face, I would recomend using it sparingly until you get used to the tingling, my skin doesnt even budge because I give myself a 3 minute glycolic acid peel weekly at 70% straight glycolic acid (DONT RECOOMEND AT HOME UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND HAVE WORKED UP TO THAT STRENGTH)  But for daily needs for great RESURFACING this is the BEST BANG for your BUCK! Many other creams at stores cost $50 and up for less content.  Truly you are paying for brand and the box.  I have tried Murad, La Prarie, blah blah, every brand..you wont be disappointed if you love glycolic products.  However, you will still need a SPF with this cream, so I get my SPF with my fondation I wear.  I am glad no SPF with this cream bc I think it would lower the aacid content.  Enjoy and buy it, I dont think anyone will be disappointed! Using this every other day has helped my daughter tremendously. The face wash and toner can be pretty drying so this is a great addition.My daughter has been struggling for quite sometime with horrible acne on her back, chest and face. Embarrassed to wear tanks, and anything lower cut, swimsuits in the summer...it was sad. We had tried every treatment the doctors suggested (topicals, creams, anti biotics) nothing helped. We went to a dermatologist and she finally put her on Accutane which is a nightmare to even get if you are a woman, especially one in your teens. She took this for a few months and it was working wonderfully...then her blood tests came back that her liver enzymes were really high (shutting down high). So, they terminated that treatment. She was so upset.As a young girl I had the same issues...never on my chest and back though...but nothing worked. Until my mom purchased me a kit...it was called Aqua glycolic. It had a toner, a face wash and face cream. It helped me. Took a couple of months, but my face cleared up and only had minimal return. I searched everywhere for it...looked on here and found that it is now called Maderma. In fine print on the bottles it said ""formerly aqua glycolic"". I was skeptical, but ordered it all for her to try. It has been a couple of months and her face is clear. She has no more backne, or any breakouts on her chest.I will continue to buy this so long as it is available. Aqua Glycolic is still number 1 for ""naked-eye""  visible & affordable results. This product has proven more effective for me over medically prescribed, otc &  cosmeceutical product treatments I've tried throughout my 50+ years. I love that I don't need a special high-powered magnifying lens to see my facial results of smoother skin, less noticeable lines & wrinkles, increased firmness, fading of scars and overall even skin pigmentation improvement. My melasma/sun-damaged skin along my entire upper jaw line has softened so much, a light coat of foundation actually cover it without break-thru in 1 hour. Use sunscreen when using this product. Use sunscreen all the time & everyday of the year.Customized use has been key to my successful results with this product. For me, using it as part of my night-time treatment skin care regime allows this product to work as it should without redness,  burning, or a reaction to my sensitive skin. There are nights (in all seasons) I switch back & forth with a moisture only night-time cream. Adjust (customize) your use depending what you need or don't that particular night. Dependable, gentle, effective, affordable & I never noticed a fragrance. A value based,  results driven, buy; all for pre sales tax of $20 U.S. dollars or so.In my honest opinion,  there isn't a beauty product, skin care regime, or cosmeceutical that will turn back a lifetime of living with my face & skin to when I was 25. Aqua Glycolic does the best job in slowing it down so much I'm given time to recognize & accept my older (but oh so much ""cooler"" self).No, I didn't get paid in any form by anyone for this review.  I just really love this product, the results & affordability."
116,B000052YOX,"I have tried dozens of facial moisturizers with sunscreen. Most are either too thick and don't provide enough moisturizer or they smell like either a day at the beach or a bouquet of flowers. This one is different. It has been my daily sunscreen moisturizer for years. It's not smelly and has the right consistency for daily use. I apply it in the morning and periodically before going outside. If I could change anything about it, I would up the spf slightly and reduce the cost slightly. I feel I need a bit more protection and it does get pricy if you use it as consistently as I do. I do use a non-sunscreen moisturizer under it initially in the morning because spf moisturizers in general don’t penetrate too deeply. I've been using this product for 5+ years, and I can't go without. It's super easy to apply, which I just use one full pump. It also doesn't make my face feel oily! I also think these bottles last a decent amount of time! I can always tell when I forgot to put some on as well! What I like about this product is that it is great as an aftershave lotion.  There is no alcohol in the lotion so it doesn't sting at all like a regular aftershave.  What I dislike:  1.  I prefer the same product with SPF 35 sunscreen which is currently not available from Neutrogena.  2.  You have to be extremely careful applying the lotion anywhere near your eyes because it really irritates if you get a little in your eye by accident.  Overall it is a very good product I use every time I shave. My Mother could not find this item at the usual stores she frequents. It is the only moisturizer she will use. I offered to purchase on Amazon. The price was very reasonable  and delivery was speedy. Mom's Happy! Neutrogena is a favorite brand for sensitive skin and this doesn't disappoint. I use with a drop of covergirl skin-milk foundation for a naturally healthy ""no makeup"" look. No breakouts or irritations. Very nice! Neutrogena Oil-Free Daily Long Lasting Facial Moisturizer & Neck Cream with SPF 15 Sunscreen works great.  Love that it is oil free. I have been using this product for 30 years, people always comment on how pretty and wrinkle free my skin is, I swear it’s this moisturizer! I like this product, it’s very hard for some reason to find it in stores, happy I could get it."

118,B000VEWF2Q,"So, let me first start off on the overall performance of this eye cream.  It feels really nice on the skin.  Really feels like it is moisturizing my under eye area.  The only thing is that I feel like it is a little too heavy for wearing under makeup.  Even if I put a face powder on top of my makeup, my eye make up will run due to the heaviness of the moisturizer.  To counter this, I apply baby powder or cornstarch under my eyes.  So I do like it b/c I bought it to moisturizer my delicate eye area.  My biggest issue with this product is the packaging.  I don't mind small pots of moisturizer but this one is really big and it has that annoying plastic cover that sits on the inside that you have to remove every time you open it.  Yes, I can throw it out but then it just ends up every where when I open it.  It would be wonderful if the packaging could be a tube to easily apply the formula to your finger. I love this eye cream, and find that a little dab does fine. I can use it for cleansing or moisturizing. My eyes can be sensitive, so this one works well for me. I've used it for a couple of years. My only complaint is that when it arrived the packaging was slightly damaged, and the eye cream had leaked out to in transit.The formula doesn't bother my eyes like some do, and it does seem to relieve puffiness. I use it sparingly, yet it goes a long way. If you want this product don't buy in the mall as you can see cheap here,,Not sure how good the product is, it does a little, but your not paying that much as you can see,, what do you expect,,I use the serum and the eye cream,, roughly a total of $30 bucks which doesn't cost much more than cream at walgreen'sso my expectations are loweredI mean this isn't Dr Perricone stuff or Eye Serum from Erno Lazo or any of the other expensive creams. But what do you know what really is in the bottles and how much it really cost for them to manufacture? You don't, I say you try a few different ones and find the one that works for you and your skin type. I mean $30 bucks total to try this isn't much considering how much I pay for my Lazo Eye serum and cream and they raised the bar of sea mud soap from $20 to $40 now, which is lame, the soap has doubled in 10 years. Still I like the Erno Lazo for men best. I bought this before and I was very satisfied so I bought another one but the packaging is not good. The content is not full like the one I bought, it was like 3/4 only. I bought an $80 eye cream that I tried at a makeup event which was sent to me through another store.  It was a smaller container than I anticipated.  I subsequently returned it and looked on Amazon for another eye cream.I've been using this eye cream for awhile and am very happy with the results.  It is super absorbent on your skin and you really only have to use a tiny bit.  I usually end up getting more than a dab on my finger and have to put it on other areas of my face.I'm always on the lookout for quality beauty products and honestly bought this based on positive reviews.  So I'm giving this 5 stars because it lives up to the reviews.  You have to be diligent and put it on at least once a day to get the desired results-less puffy, reduce dark circles.  It is a great product for the price, I'm happy to report!! I recently received a sample from Neiman Marcus. The sample literally sat in the bottom of my shopping bag for about a week. I thought one night let me try this since i had ran out the eye cream I use by strivectin. Well lo and behold I tell you I could see a difference in the appearance of my eyes in about a week. the fine lines were not as noticeable. I went to Nordstroms to see if they offered it. They do not carry the product. I was telling the sales girl that I planned on ordering it. She advised me to check on amazon first before ordering from there website... And Boy am I glad that i did. I just ordered it for 29.00 compared to 150.00. THis made my day! and i can't wait to receive my order. This cream is excellent. It really helps with dark circles and eye puffiness. I highly recommend it. This cream is INCREDIBLE!! I have used other creams in the past and waited and waited for results and none ever came. Finally something that shows results FAST! I received this cream 4 days ago and have been using it day and night since. I can already see a difference in the fine lines under my eyes. I am keeping it in the fridge, since I wake up with puffy eyes, and it seems to help with the puffiness. I also ordered the eye serum from this brand and I am hoping it has the same amazing effects that this cream has had. I will definitely continue to use and will recommend over and over again!"

120,B0009R14XQ,"I'm at the beach every weekend.I've used this product for decades.It works and smells pretty good.However, when you go to see your dermatologist and they ask you if you use any kind of skin protection product with an SPF factor in it, it's probably not a good idea to mention this one.They look at you with astonished amazement to see if you're being serious.I told mine ""well, yes, it does have an SPF protection rating of ""4"".They continue to stare at you wondering if you've been released permanently from the mental health care facility where you reside of if you're just out on a 3 day pass.Then they start to look at their assistants because they can't believe what they are hearing either.My dermatologist is pretty cool, though.  She left the room and came back in with all kinds of stuff that had SPF values of 50 and higher.  She said ""Normally we only give out the sample sizes but you REALLY need to start using these other things and I'm giving you the Jumbo sizes which we normally don't do but...""Anyway, we had fun doing biopsies and assorted other FSA (fun skin activities) and yes, I've added the Big Guns skin products to my regimen but I really love this Aussie Gold.  It smells good and it's been such a part of my life for so long it's hard to just not use it entirely.  So I do a half and half mix to keep her happy and what not.You won't be disappointed with this if you want to use at least something to ward off UV's but still get a nice tan, smell good  and keep your dermatologist at bay.  Sort of. Was happy Australian Gold came out with a SPF 50 product. This smells good, goes on smooth, stay on after getting wet, and protects your skin like a champ. Wish the would get this out to retailers to make it easier to acquire. Thanks Amazon for carrying. Adds a slight color while providing SPF sun protection.  Australian Gold is our exclusive sun product brand.  I've used many of  their products for years and years.  Nice variety of products available. This is the best product! It has a bronzer that is really nice. I never want to run out! The seller sent it before it was due! Many thanks! 👍 Love this product just not happy it came leaking. Which I understand happens. Nice product Nice for the money. Excelente"
121,B000GDDKIU,"I recently purchased the Murad Clarifying Facial Cleanser and it is amazing! It has completely changed my skin care routine and I can already see a difference in my skin. I have issues with acne, and this product has done wonders for keeping it under control.The formulation is far better than any other salicylic acid competitors I have tried. It doesn't dry my skin out too much, and doesn't clog my pores either. It does leave my skin feeling refreshed and invigorated. It also lasts a good while, so one bottle will last for a good amount of time.The only con I can mention is that it is expensive. But, it's worth the price for the results I have seen. I highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with acne or who just wants a great facial cleanser. I have been using this product for a year and I love it.  Most facial products make me breakout. This products makes my skin soft and NO breakouts I use this face wash once last night in the shower and this morning when I woke up I let it sit for about a minute and a half before washing it off…This morning when I woke up all of my deep under the skin blackheads and acne almost vanish my skin has FAR LESS texture/bumps. I think it’s as good as they say. Remember (not all face wash works the same for everyone)That is the boat I’ve been in for years no matter the face wash I have used my acne has never improved. So hopefully this continues doing what it says. I absolutely love the cooling effect this gives when putting on and after you wash it off! I recommend! This product is so great for my skin, and has helped me out so much. It feels very refreshing when using it on my skin. It was recommended to me by a friend, and now I recommend it to anyone who reads this, especially if you have oily skin. I see that my skin is better. But just use it once a day. Apply moisturizer day and night. Yes, no more pimples. The price is a little steep for face wash BUT i bought this back in 2021 and am just now running out of it. I have very oily skin and this helped me BIG time! I definitely recommend An effective skin cleanser that is very easy to use. Your skin will thank you for buying this product. Well worth the price.Recommend."
122,B00027D6SE,"I like it but looks different with the picture I have combination skin so I use this around my jaw and chin where I tend to get cystic hormonal acne. It keeps that area just dry enough that I don’t break out. As someone who deals with cystic acne, I'm always willing to try a product that will show overnight results. This is the product. While it obviously won't eliminate acne overnight, I see around a 50% reduction after one night of use. It stays on well, doesn't smell bad at all, lasts a really long time, but most importantly works. You won't regret buying this product. I started dealing with minor breakouts at 17, & between then & college (22) i could also manage them with bp & a good concealer. However, as I got into my mid 20s, & even now at 34, i started to experience adult hormonal acne. It's never been severe, but when I say I have tried everything to prevent my hormonal breakouts, I'm not kidding. Salicylic acid & benzoyl peroxide don't even break the surface. In fact, I am a licensed esthetician in FL, where i live now because of my skin. I had studied & researched skin & skincare so so much on my own that I figured, heck, make it a career. I knew as much, if not more then my instructor lol. I did start school to help my own skin & have the knowledge needed to do so, but my intent was also to help others dealing with any skin issue & I took my training even further w/ extra classes & medical esthetics. I have helped so many people get their acne, rosacea, eczema, hyperpigmentation, erythem, etc under control but, the thing that gets me....i still deal with adult acne.  I have had hormone tests done & know what my imbalances are & what causes it. I could prob take spironolactone & birth control & rid myself of all breakouts, but I choose not to add artifice hormones or things that block androgens into my body. So that means I deal with supplements, eating right & good skincare. Most of my breakouts now stem from stress & the increased cortisol levels that brings, along with insulin resistance. When I get them I am now very good at clearing them quickly & making sure they do not leave behind marks in the form of post inflammatory erythema (red spots via broken capillaries, for me the most common) or post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark spots from increased melanin production).I used to really like Mario Badescu's drying lotion & was looking for a bit cheaper option when I found this. There are about 6 types of similar SA & sulfur based spot trmts on amazon alone. My skin doesn't respond to SA by itself very well, but the anti-inflammatory effects of sulfur really help my skin & so I like the combo. You have to read the ingrediebts of these spot trmts carefully though, they are not created equal. Some ppl can't use camphor & some can't handle calamine. Test anything new for 24-48 hrs in a nonobvious spot on your skin before applying everywhere.Personally, my skin likes the slight variation in the ingredients in this product better than the Mario B product. I'm a-ok with that since it's $10 less. This is also a bit closer to skin tone & less bright so if I do have it on around someone else I don't look as crazy lol. Let me say though that the top clear liquid in here is alcohol. It can & will be drying. Try not to get this on the healthy skin surrounding your blemish & maybe alternate with a hydrocolloidal spot dot to keep the area from drying out. Active treatment ingredients cannot penetrate dry crusty skin. It'll just sit on top & do nothing for you. This is also just not going to do much for deep cystic or nodular acne. It cannot penetrate deep enough. If you have an open blemish, I'm not saying don't apply it, cause I have done that too, but..  It's gonna burn for a sec. Overall, I do think this is a good option for whiteheads, papular & pustular acne. The SA can help to loosen blackheads because it is oil soluable (until glycolic, lactic & malic acids which are water soluable, all AHAs are) but it's not as effective against them. Give it a try, i think this is the best spot trmt out there in this format. I like this more than EradiKate as well. I haven’t had breakouts in years, so I didn’t have any type of acne clearing skin care. The last few months I’ve been breaking out around my upper neck/ low chin area. I got this bye bye blemish drying lotion to help cure that. I’ve heard a lot about a similar product by Mario Badescu. This comes in a glass bottle holding 1 ounce of product. About half the bottle looks like a pink powder (sulfur) the other half is water. Do not shake. If you shake, let the bottle sit upright for a few hours, so the ingredients can separate again. First of all this smells awful, this doesn’t smell like something that should go on my face. It smells like cough syrup combined with paint and nail polish. I’m also pretty cautious about what goes on my skin. The directions say to to dip a q-tip into the sulfur. Unfortunately, this causes the cotton of the q-tip to absorb most of the product, but I did it anyway, and I used the swab to apply it to the areas that need it. Oh this smells awful... but it applies very thinly and dies immediately. I wore it before bed, when there isn’t much else on my skin. After about two days of use my breakouts are basically gone. I wouldn’t use it any longer, this isn’t gentle, and it will dry out the skin, now I have some minor peeling. This is 10% sulfur, as the active ingredient. This works, but use lightly and with caution. A q-tip is the best, because you really do apply lightly with it. I have sensitive skin and lately I've been breaking out with bumps that have clear liquid in them. Tried everything. I read the reviews and bought this. SO GLAD I DID!!! It helped after one night but so much better after three nights.  The blemishes I have are pretty bad, I will continue to use until gone.😊😉😁 The hole family uses this when we get a bad pimple. Quickly solves the problem!"
123,B000ALFTUU,"I'm obsessed with this. It's gentle enough to use often but scrubby enough to get rid of any dead skin, oils, makeup etc. The texture and consistency is also really great, A little goes a long way! I've been using this scrub for years.  I absolutely love it! I like that the base is cream which helps to control the grains from getting in the eyes which has happened with a soap base. This product has no sent and you need very little in order to wash your whole face. This product last long time and cleaned your face quite well. The product is great...it is unscented and very creamy So very happy to find Clinique 7 Day Scrub available for sale on Amazon.  It is truly a product that can be used daily.  A great cleansing product that I've used forever.  It is nice not to have to go to the Department store to get the product in these days of Covid. I’ve loved 7 Day Scrub for years. It shines up my sensitive skin. The only problem for me is that it seems expensive, so I’ve found a way to make it last a little longer. Have a small jar handy, the size samples come in. When you’ve squeezed as much as you can get out of the tube, cut the end off of the tube, and then cut lengthwise to the top. Using a clean spoon scrape the 7 Day Scrub off of the tube and into the jar. That way you get all of what you paid for. Good product"
124,B000GHGGKK,"Apllies weel, doe snot make the skin oily, gentle , no rash reactions I have Leukemia and with the medicne, I have to take, my face breaks out, this is the only cream that keeps it under control.  Thank you Mary Kay I have used Mary Kay products for many years, have tried others, but always go back to this Moisturizing cream and their night cream.  I've always passed for being much younger than I really am. Facial wash People tell me I don't look my age.This does not feel too thick or heavy when I am applying it to my face. Love this product. I’ve been using it for years. I have used this product off and on for years. It is as good as others costing way more. I love Mary Kay,. But the Originalyouth my face.  Price was Ok these time"
125,B000PIMUR8,"My skin looks very smooth, no break-outs, zero wrinkles, etc. since I've used this product for over a year now. Love it and wouldn't change.  At night I use a small amount of face scrub, rinse, then more of the toner. I used to get professional facial. With  this product don't need them. Love it! And I'm a Grandmother with very smooth skin---I think from this product and nightly face scrub--that's all I do. My family has been using Thayers Witch Hazel for years to reduce inflammation from acne or injuries anywhere on our skin, including in sensitive areas. Without alcohol in the toner, it doesn't overdry. The aloe also doesn't leave a sticky residue. We like that Thayers uses high purity and quality ingredients without unnecessary additives. Thayers is gentle enough to use every day to avert issues and to help heal problems. I like the refeshing cucumber scented toner and my husband, who has very sensitive skin, prefers unscented. I had been using the rose Thayers toner for about a year when I decided I should try the lavender. Although I like the scent of rose better, the lavender has actually cleared up my face and calmed my skin more. So glad I decided to switch. Just use a couple of cotton pads with this after washing your face and just look at how much dirt and makeup that the face washed missed! This is an important step to my face care and I use it everyday! I highly recommend and it smells good too This product is good for sensitive skin. It does not over dry the face. And the scent is very mild which I love. I’m not the kind to be able to handle such strong fragrances. I rarely write reviews but this definitely deserves one!  Wish I have used this for years. Have been using it for like a week so far and my face is 100% smoother. Feels clean (and is!). Wow! Highly recommend!  You won’t be disappointed! I have particularly sensitive and acne prone skin and this toner used after the cerve moisturizing face wash has cleared my skin up more then any other products. I have been making my teenage boys use it and have seen their skin improving as well. Very happy with this product. I love this product. but it is an amazing facial toner, I 've been using Thayers Original Witchazel Facial Toner for the last three days this is an absolute lifesaver. I have sensitive, acne-prone combination skin. My acne has reduced in size and this product isnt drying like other acne products or toners. My skin feels very hydrated after. Amazing! Ive only had it for a couple of days and already see a difference in my skin's texture and redness level use it every night before bed. It helps clear my skin and remove any excess oils and makeup after I cleanse my face. I also have put it in a travel-size container and carry it around with me and if I feel my skin is getting greasy I just put some onto a cotton pad and wipe my face and it leaves me feeling fresh and clean. It does smell like roses when you squeeze it out of the bottle but I haven't noticed my skin smelling like roses and it hasn't made me sneeze or make my eyes water after use."
126,B001DSG9GC,"I have used this before and was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It is a great exfoliating product  My face feels so clean and smooth after I use it. I almost didn’t buy because of past bad reviews ! I use origins mostly but this product is better !  Will continue to buy. Worth every penny. Love it. I've been using the pear & poppy for three weeks religiously 4 times a week. It works well to get rid of dry and dead skin cells. The texture is abrasive enough so that you feel your face is getting a good scrubbing, but it does not irritate the skin at all, and I have fairly sensitive skin. Because the poppy seeds are round, the mixture rolls over your face without scratching it, which is a big plus.The base is kind of strange, though, not like I've experienced in any other exfoliator. It's like a jam, a bit jellied, which is taking me time to get used to. Also, it's harder to remove than most, so I keep it in my shower and let the water run over my face while I remove it with a face cloth. Even still, I will find a few poppy seeds on my face afterwards when I am moisturizing.The best part is that a very little goes a long way, and it spreads easily, so the value is here in this product. The worst part, for me, is that the smell is not great, not bad at all, it's just that it's not what I would expect from an organic product made with essential oils. I love to breathe in a lovely aroma from my facial products. I will most likely add a few drops of sweet orange to the jar, just to enjoy using the product more. There was no seal on this jar. Was it tampered with? The jar also wasn’t filled up so it seemed to be used. The product didn’t smell very good, so that was another issue. I can’t  recommend this product. I just learned that it is not returnable and does not allow feedback to the seller. Sounds fishy to me. The Eminence line of products is the only thing I now use for my face. Besides it not having any chemicals, it's improved my face immensely. I no longer have breakouts and when I do, they go away quickly. I use this polisher when I feel I need to exfoliate my skin (once or twice a week). It really exfoliates the skin and some seeds are a bit too harsh so I do recommend using it with your cleanser that way the mixture softens a bit. I use it with my Eminence Stone Crop Gel cleanser and get a gel like consistency. I then massage it into the skin gently in circular motions for 30 sec to a minute and then wash it off. I also recommend putting on a good moisturizer after this. Using this routinely once a week helps me keep my skin breakout free. It seems like the bad reviews are from people who don’t understand how to use Eminence products. I’ve had professional facials with these products for years and they are beyond incredible. This scrub is a coarse scrub, you don’t need to rub hard, Let it work for you. If your skin is sensitive don’t rub as long or use too often. I have sensitive and oily skin and use it weekly if not twice a week, coupled with two other eminence products. Sometimes my skin is pink and calms down within 15 minutes. At the end of it my pores are sparkling and smaller and my face is glowing. I have had rash/ allergic reactions to a few OTC face products and never had any negative reactions from eminence. I originally purchased this because the ingredient list is so short!After trying to make my own at home (and it ended up molding) I decided to try commercial organic products but they all were either lacerating my face or not doing any serious exfoliating.  This is the happy medium I have been searching for!  A long time ago I used St. Ives apricot scrub and this has the same level of exfoliating grit.It smells great; like fresh apple juice. It has a very gel-like consistency so that you have to scoop it up and it doesn't just run off your hand. I use about a nickle size amount every 3days.  There is no stinging, or tingling, or any other sensation except that of you mechanically scrubbing away dead skin and debris.If I was going to get nit-picky, I'd say it shouldn't be in a plastic container (but glass is very heavy and very breakable to ship so far- so I understand).  It is a product of Hungary. I love this! You only need a tiny bit to mix with water and it exfoliates your face like nothing else I've ever used. Leaves my face so soft. Other reviews have said it's like glass but I think that if you take a very small amount, miss in your hands with water and then spread it on your face, you wont have that problem. Eminence is one of my favorite brands and this stuff is definitely no exception"
127,B000YJ2SLG,"This is my Folliculitis Journey and i include ALL THE PRODUCTS I USED to get rid of it.I got Folliculitis on my groin area, i had no idea what it was since i have never had it but it started spreading down my legs and leaving these dark marks/scars. The lesions started multiplying, i went to the doctors who gave me an ointment gel, which did absolutely nothing for me, it was an acne treatment.Since it started getting hotter and summer was near i knew i had to act fast or else i would have to wear pants all summer. First things first, from my research it states not to shave to prevent he spread of Folliculitis, so yes i did just that. I didn't shave for over a month...i know gross but it had to be done.*If you do decide to shave, use a new fresh blade every time you shave in order to prevent spread. Also if you have folliculitis on your legs don't use the same blade on your armpits etc.I looked up items on amazon and read reviews for ""Almond Clear: Body Clearing Serum"" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0866B6CV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1I decided to give it a try, i started with Level 1 and used it with the Hibliclens antibacterial soap as everyone in the reviews did. I already had the soap since its so amazing and i recommend everyone have thissoap in their home it works miracles. I was already using this soap by itself for about 2 weeks prior to buying the Almond Clear bottle and i noticed no difference. When i read that buyers were combining both Almond Clear Serum and the soap i decided to do the same, but still i felt that Hibliclens did not do much for me. My Folliculitis was very stubborn!https://www.amazon.com/Molnlycke-Hibiclens-HIBICLENS-LIQ-OZ/dp/B00E5R65SA/ref=sr_1_3?crid=GNSU7PU7YVEN&dchild=1&keywords=hibiclens&qid=1590613599&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&sprefix=hibi%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-3*Everyone is different so what works for someone might not work for others.As for the Almond Clear serum, i noticed immediately a difference! overnight the lesions seemed like they shrunk.The only complaint is that the bottle doesn't contain much. I had a big area to cover so 1 bottle was finished in 1 week. I would definitely recommend you purchase the bigger bottle so its worth your money (they have the 4oz option available). Also level 1 is more for someone who might have like 1-4 lesions..or for sensitive areas like the face. I felt like it made a difference but i definitely needed something stronger to completely get rid of them, i should've skipped to level2 like everyone else did in the reviews.I bought level 2 when i ran out of level 1 and i definitely noticed a huge difference! Listen to me right now, if you suffer from severe Folliculitis YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS!Honestly my case got so bad i had so many lesions on my groin area they started spreading down to my thighs and legs and even my private area :(i was so stressed i couldn't wear shorts and even pants would cause me to breakout in hives and the infected areawould get so red and irritated easily. It got bad!Luckily this product saved my life..I started using this April 20, today is May 27 and i am pretty much cured, the lesions are all gone and even the scars are faded! This product faded the nasty dark marks.The reviews recommend using up to 2xs a day. This did not work for me, my skin is very sensitive so i would only use 1x a day, every night after i showered i would apply and leave overnight. I do have to say that this product makes your skin peel and drys your skin out. For me, it made my skin excessively dry and i would shed skin almost everyday.Because my skin was getting beyond dry i decided to moisturize. I used CeraVe Moistorizing Lotion every morning when i woke up.*(make sure to always wash your hands before and after you apply a product to prevent from spreading to other body parts).https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YJ2SLG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I used this lotion because alot of people with skin issues use this lotion and it works well, i had no issues, great product!I shower every night so i decided to use a Folliculitis body wash i found on Amazon. I leave it on the area for about 5 mins then i rinse. I also noticed a big difference with this product right after the 1st use! I used this product for about 1.5 months?https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBL3RES/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s04?ie=UTF8&psc=1Another product i used in the shower was the Nizoral Shampoo. I saw YouTube videos of people who used it on their arms and face to treat folliculitis. Luckily i already had this shampoo as well, its to treat dandruff, i recommend for both dandruff and for folliculitis, i feel like this items made a difference. I replaced the Hibliclens soap with this product, i leave it on the area for about 5 mins then rinse in the shower. I used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AINMFAC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The final product i used was Defense Soap, i used this soap in order to kill any bacteria or fungi that might have been causing the Folliculitis. I felt like this also made a difference and i washed my whole body with this in order to prevent any Folliculitis from spreading on my stomach or arms...I was terrified of getting it any where else, the soap makes you feel fresh and clean specially after a workout! It does dry your skin so you don't have to use everyday, but if you do i would definitely recommend to moisturize with the CeraVe lotion or just any lotion in general. I used this product for about a month.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HYBK2YF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1*Be sure to use these products EVERYDAY, TO SEE RESULTS YOU HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT.If you are on a budget: Out of all the products i would definitely recommend you use the Almond Clear Serum and the Folliculitis Body Wash by Ovante. Yes i know this is a VERY LONG routine and so many products to use, but all my folliculitis is pretty much gone already! It is pricey to buy all these items, but honestly i was willing to pay $100+ in order to get rid of this and it was worth it!I guess it depends how bad do you want to get rid of this? I think its worth it!Do your research, find out what works for you, try different products until you find something that works for your skin. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE! I’ve been using body lotion daily after bathing, from neck to toes my entire life. Well, since I’ve been old enough to do it myself, probably since 4 years old.After they stopped distribution of Complex 15, in the US, I chased it down in Canada. I would order 10 bottles at a time and had it shipped here only for it to be discontinued. I spent years, yes YEARS trying different lotions. Only to be disappointed. I would slog my way through bottle after bottle trying all brands from high brow to low. And I’ll still try a new lotion whenever one pops up. But this particular formula of CeraVe is the only one that comes close.It has a higher viscosity and therefore tiniest bit of lingering slickeriness. I find that when I use it on my hands and arms before I go to bed I notice a very faint odor. Kinda like a chemical-sourish smell. I’ve taken to adding a teeny half-drop of another scented lotion to cut the smell. (Admittedly I have heightened olfactory.) It still has great coverage, absorbs well, is (mostly) unscented, keeps me moisturized all day and is lightweight. If you look at the ingredients water is the first listed. That’s usually a good sign. Yes, you read that. I absolutely abhor wearing moisturizer. I hate everything about it, smearing it on, the texture on my hands, the texture sitting on my face, everything. However, as I continue into my 40s and especially with the dry winter air, there's no denying that it is necessary. After trying about six different brands/formulations, the Internet suggested CeraVe. I decided to go for it and haven't looked back since. This is truly a lightweight formula that absorbs quickly and isn't too sticky. It probably isn't sticky at all; that's how sensitive I am to even the word lotion. Speaking about sensitivity, I also have VERY sensitive skin. We're talking I blow my nose twice and my entire central face it irritated. I burned easily as a kid (I don't anymore since I wear SPF every single day), have very pink cool undertones, lots of freckles, and still have a fairly oily forehead and chin by the end of the day. I got away without using anything on my face through my 30s but now I truly need just enough hydration to keep the dry spots at bay. This also wears great under a tinted moisturizer (we know it's not the same as lotion) or foundation (even mixed in). The fact that I could use it on my body and my face was also a huge selling point. It is completely fragrance free and once it is rubbed in and dried, I do not feel that heaviness I have experienced even with Clinique and Neutrogena lightweight formulas. I do need to use quite a bit of it on my legs but just a dab does my entire face. If you are looking for something as truly lightweight and as it states, for daily use, I highly recommend this. I'm sure the cream is awesome for those who need something more concentrated. It is also budget friendly compared to anything from a cosmetic counter. I have been using this Moisturizer for several weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed with the results. This has not only hydrated my skin but has also improved its texture and overall health.One of the main reasons I love this moisturizer is that it contains hyaluronic acid, which is known for its hydrating properties. I have noticed that my skin feels softer and smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes have started to fade away.What's even more impressive is that this product is great for maintaining a healthy skin barrier. It contains essential ceramides that help strengthen the skin barrier, preventing moisture loss and protecting against environmental stressors.Another thing I appreciate about this is that it doesn't feel heavy or greasy on my skin. It absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized.Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a moisturizer that will hydrate and improve their skin's health.BTW, I have ACNE PRONE OILY SKIN! Hope this helps :)"
128,B00120XR0M,"I am nearing 60 with olive skin, and large pores on my face. I've had an oily face practically all my life with shine in the T zone until around 45. Therefore, to me, face moisturizer was the last thing I wanted to use on my face, especially creams because they are way too heavy. In the last 15 years, I would use oil free serums and somewhat creamy gels to moisturize. My regimen is more like, whenever I feel like taking care of my face. Not regular at all. Now, I still get a light oil all over my face, except I actually have dry patches on my cheeks and outer brow bones. Dry patches....such a foreign thing for me. My face has only fine lines and fine wrinkles, except the worry lines are getting a bit deeper, but I think the oil in my skin has actually slowed the aging process, for which I consider myself so lucky and I am very grateful!!So needing a new face moisturizer, I turned to Alba first. I did research other options, only to buy from Alba in the end, unsurprisingly. This cream is very light and not oily at all! I received it yesterday and after using Alba's pore refining face wash for the first time, I applied this moisturizer. This morning, my skin is still soft and dewy, not oily at all, and it did not clog my pores!! The scent is lovely, light and airy! I also used it on my arms and the back of my hands and fingers. They are so soft and the fine wrinkles at the wrist and on my fingers are reduced greatly! I am so happy with this moisturizer. It is well worth the money!! I can't wait to see it's full benefits long term!! Love that this is pure, unscented, and moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and this feels soft and gentle. I add essential oils for further natural skin care too. It is the perfect carrier moisturizer. I have used Alba products for a number of years.  Had been unable to find this moisturizer locally in the past year and after trying to get by with other brands decided I had to order online.It has a perfect balance of light moisture, and scent.  My skin loves it. It has a fresh scent and the texture is light and silky. love this cream, it's the best substitute for another cream they no longer make or sell.Amazon packages are coming in brown paper padded envelopes with some kind of foam? between the layers. not environmental! not plastic? but what is it? Love this moisturizer. It is silky smooth and non greasy. Well worth it. I use this moisturizer in combination with their face wash and acne pads. I use the wash first, then acne pads, then moisturizer. I have problems with cystic acne, and combination skin. Partially from going off birth control, and PCOS. I also have extremely sensitive skin. This combination after a month of use has helped my skin a ton. The acne I get now is much smaller bumps that go away quickly. Its gentle, and has helped me so much. This moisturizer in specific is very light, has a nice smell. And helps hydrate my skin. It's not greasy like other products, and it doesn't dry my skin out. I have tried so many different products, my most recent peach slices and it just didn't work. It made it worse. Please give this a try, in combination with their other products. If you have similar issues, it might be worth it. Other sellers try to sell knock offs or opened products but this is from the manufacturer"
129,B0017DQGQ6,"The aroma might smell a little industrial for some people, but I don't mind it.  It's made with clean ingredients and is a good base for make up.  Its properties helps prevent age spots very well.  At 72, I don't have any on my face considering all the years I soaked up sun.  My legs are a different story in comparison, so I wish I would have used it on my legs. My wife and I have both used it for 3+ years and have seen nothing but benefits soothing hydrating just all-around amazing 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone sensitive skin or not I have been using this product for about 8 years. Love it Since I have rosacea, my skin is very sensitive. I have used three bottles of this product. It helps soothe my skin and keep it from getting so irritated. Very moisturizing and doesn’t break me out! It’s a great way to feel refreshened and add moisture through out the day! I’ve ordered a couple bottles. My husband loves the scent too! I first was exposed to this product at a spa in Hawaii and learn the locals actually use it if they get a bit too much sun to try to reduce any redness. I’ve been using it ever cents morning and night for a moisturizing a fact and also to help even out skin tone. I love it My Experience: I love 💗 the Eminence product line. It has been years since I used so I thought I would try on Amazon. I was not disappointed. My product arrived professionally sealed just like i bought it directly from an esthetician years ago. I love the ‘Stone 💗Crop Hydrating Mist.’ I do like to try different skincare products but I always come back to the best, especially as my skin grows older. For me, often with skincare products, NOT always, you get what  you pay for when it comes to quality ingredients! Eminence provides my skin with emollience, quality herb ingredients that keeps it soft and supple, not oily or dry. I can see the difference. I love the way this smells—it doesn’t bother me, and I have allergies. It makes my skin really soft & smooth, my skin  soaks it up with no oily residue. I am normal-combo but a little on the dryer side because of using Retinol's. I have very sensitive skin and prone to eczema break-outs now and then. I can use this line. Love this!! I will order again!! Helps my skin heal.(NOT paid or reimbursed for this review)"
130,B001AH8PZY,"Been using this for years because it is so moisturizing, does nothing for over lip lines , expected a better price at Amazon, but did not get it. I use it on my eyes and lips, and it works. My lips can get a bit dry and thinner looking, it plumps them up - and I use it as night as a night eye cream. I can see a difference in the skin around my eyes. As always nothing is a miracle but this does seem to work as promised. This is a great product for firming that droopy eyelid skin. I use it around my eyes as well as my lip area morning and night. Best I’ve found for this problem area as we age. It truly makes a difference. Highly recommend! As a former makeup artist, I have used almost all of the prestige eye treatments.  Philosophy Hope in a Tube is far better than all others for diminishing deep lines and dryness.  It also brightens the eye area.  Fantastic product that is affordable. It is fairly decent, however, Philosophy previously had a similar product that I used which also came in a small tube. Seems to me it was slightly narrower than this one, but when you put a dab under your eyes the dark circle and bags simply disappeared.  That was a MIRACLE worth a Gold Mine this just isn’t the same.  I so wish it was, not bad, but not what I HOPED. Like,ed everything a bit pricey I have been using this for several years and have yet to find anything better.  Very moisturizing and I find it doesn’t creep into my eyes which, with other moisturizers, stings and make my eyes water.  Highly recommend. I've been using this product since 2010. You need to get used to the viscosity.  It's thicker than what you're used to, so dot it on and gently work it into the skin. A little goes a long way.  If you wear concealer, you'll find that it goes on much easier. This product is a great hydrator.  Great for those crow's feet and any other wrinkles around the eye or lip area. I love this product."
131,B000FQOQ5Y,"I got this soap because I like anime and it let's me pretend I'm in a anime taking a shower Nearly through my first bar with use on just my face. I can't claim some of the sensational results that others have...are you really expecting a miracle at 3 bucks a bar? I have oily skin, large pores, and occasional blackheads. I think my skin was less oily during winter but there's just not much to be done during the summer, though it seems like less oil production. I still get a blackhead now and then and I use an extractor when they're really asking for it. Honestly, I think this is a really clean product that doesn't strip my skin causing the oil works and still cleans. I use this in the morning and micellar water at night, the combination of the two seem to suit my skin better than a lot of $$$ combinations that I've used in the past. I love this charcoal soap.  Originally my husband bought for his feet which he is constantly trying to cure of fungus.  This soap doesn't leave a residue and from his reading, pulls out toxins.  I am consistently unable to find a facial soap that doesn't cause outbreaks.  Most of my life I have related to Ivory soap or special, expensive acne cleansers.  I began using the charcoal soap because it had no scent/perfume and I was hoping to forgo some of the harsher facial cleansers as I got older, but still got acne with soaps that had any perfume or oils in them.  I was so glad I tried it!  It keeps my face clean, free of over-done scents and oils.  It cleans my pores well and does not cause outbreaks.  After time out in the smog of downtown or driving all over with the windows open, I look forward to using this soap and have started using it in the shower as well.  LOVE it and won't stop using it. This soap has been on my wishlist for a long time,but I never went ahead & bought it. Well, I finally did & used it for two weeks to make a review of it. I've been using this everyday & night w/ a body brush. I have sensitive skin w/ a bit of eczema & I must say,that it has never irritated my skin ever. Nor has it ever made my skin flare up,the scent is very mild & gentle too. It's not very moisturizing tbh, it's very drying for the skin since I've been using it,but a good moisturizing lotion works great after you're done. Since it has charcoal the suds are grey & it does look dirty on the tub. It doesn't bother me,this soap is great I love it & it works perfectly on my sensitive skin. I don't use it for my face since it's too drying & I'm not willing to irritate my face. I will definitely buy more & I recommend it. This soap is great! I am 40ish and started getting this terrible bright red acne that seemed to be deep under my skin.  I suppose that would be cystic acne.  Not pretty at all. I went on a quest to find good skin care products when it dawned on me... Japanese people have AMAZING skin.  Since I am 1/2 I should at the least have half amazing skin. Ummmm.... yeah didn't happen. Next best thing, try using japanese products since they must be doing something right, RIGHT?This stuff worked wonders.  My shoulders and back aren't completely clear, but there is a tremendous difference.  I do use the soap with a long scrubby wash cloth (scrubby like a loofah, but not a loofah. ) I now only see a pimple here or there and they are not nearly as big, bright nor plentiful as they were prior to the soap.  I use the soap on my face as well when I am in the shower, but I found an entirely different face care regimen  (again thanks to the Japanese peeps!)I gave a bar to a friend and she says it works great on her teenage son's acne. In fact, better than anything else they have tried.  So I will most certainly have this soap at all times!I have read reviews about the scent not being pleasant, but that isn't an issue from me.  It's sort of a clean earthy to me.  It also lasts a decent amount of time like a month of daily full body use. I like the clean scent. I sent a review on this soap I just wanted to say thank you again to the company in Japan that makes the soap I've had a problem with my skin almost all my life it was not eczema it's another name and it's hard to pronounce but his definitely took that problem away I have bought at least 19 times from Amazon and I plan to buy more this is not hype this is actual fact this soap worked for my problem I had a fungus on my skin most of my life the only way I could get rid of it was the Habit grafted or use a steroid when I found this soap I gave it a try it really really works I want to thank the company again I'll be buying a lot more from them Read so many good reviews I decided to give it a try.  Love this soap!  You can smell the charcoal a little when using it but amazingly only the floral scent lingers afterwards.  After shower the skin felt squeaky clean, I was afraid it was going to leave my skin dry.  Instead it left my skin silky all day, did not need moisturizer at all.  I usually do not use soap on my face, but now I wash my face with this and I am no longer in need of expensive facial cleanser.  I also noticed that little red bumps I had on my upper arms are disappearing!  The soap is black, and when water hits it the soap turns mottled grey -- bit weird looking.  I only wish three soap bars came individually wrapped, but I just wrapped them in wax paper and put them in a zip lock bag.  One bar is lasting me over a month now, but I use it with a sponge cloth and it lathers up nicely.  Package is in Japanese and seems to be an authentic Japanese product.  Says ships from Japan but it only took 5 days to Atlanta.PS : I realized the package actually says ""cosmetic soap"" so this is really a facial soap.  Maybe I'm being extravagant using it on my whole body, at $3 a bar, but it sure makes my skin feel like I just spent a day at a mineral spa!"
132,B000BZB1FC,"I have been using MaryKay extra-night cream for decades !  I love everything about it !  I have psoriasis forever, and VERY DRY SKIN !  I have tried other face creams but MARY KAY always wins out !  Just love it !! I have been loyal to this product for a couple of years now. It makes my skin feel hydrated, like it just took a huge drink of much needed water! And it smells sooo good. It has made my skin look so much clearer and brighter and gives me a nice glow. Cannot recommend this product enough!! If you are over 50 yo better be using this stuff.  Your welcome Good product for maintenance and prevention of facial wrinkles. My mom has a hard time finding her Mary Kay favorites locally. Happy to find this old favorite online. It works , for dry skin I have been using this for 50+ years. When my children were small, i used it for chapped cheeks in winter and diaper rash. Now it's great for any kind of sore or irritation. There is no aroma. It's a miracle! This facial moisturizer is amazing. I have really dry skin. I use it day and night and it makes my makeup look even better!"
133,B0018ZTKC0,"It's to early to say for sure how the lactic acid has been helping my severe dark hyperpigmintation,  I can say it has decreased my oily skin dramatically.  My acne has been the same, but it seems to clear up a bit faster. As for my hyperpigmintation,  I dilute my 85% la in half, by mixing 1/4th teaspoon la with 1/4th teaspoon distilled water,I apply it to my face for 3 mins. Once a week and apply my diy la face lotion (15% la) on my dark spots every night, accept the night of my full face la peel. I've  noticed very little lighting to my hyperpigmintation, but feel confident that with continued use, I can get my dark spots much lighter. I just need to be patient,  it did take 52 years for my skin to get this bad, it will take awhile (thinking 6 -8 months with bi-monthly maintenance ) to fix and maintain my skin.so for now 3 stars, just because it's to soon to give what i feel is a honest review6-19-17 update: Been using the la for about 2 years now. I no longer apply the la directly on my face for 3 mins, it was just to harsh. I still apply my mixture of lotion and la every night. It hasnt totally removed it but has lighten my hyperpigmintation alot and keeps it from getting worse. You have to use spf daily and and keep the sun from your face or it comes back very fast. I now give it a 46-1-18 I have been applying the la mixed into cetaphil lotion very night for the past 3 years. It hasn't taken my hyperpigminration away but I'm sure it keeping it from becoming worse. Honestly, I feel the only thing that would remove all of my pigmentation would be a harsh chemical peel, the kind that burns the layers of my skin and has to peel off for weeks, which i something im honestly afraid to do.  This may work on mild spots but i spent decades in the sun with no sunscreen so this is not strong enough for all the damage I've done.  It is more than worth the price and I don't regret the purchase, this is why I've change it from 4 to 5 stars, even tho it hasn't removed all my hyperpigminration. Nothing but a highly skilled professional, alot of money and many painfully sessions could help me. I ordered this after using the 30% glycolic acid peel several times.  I never experienced burns or skin irritation with the glycolic, only slight flaking of the skin, so I wanted a stronger peel.  The first time I used this, I was sure to only use along my jaw line, where I have the most noticeable age spots.  Again, I only experienced slight flaking of the skin, but I was seeing gradual results.  This is major!  I have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of those spots:  many different lightening creams, and IPL treatments in a clinic.  While the IPL treatments worked, there was a downtime of several days in which I didn't want to leave my house because of the appearance of my skin, and the results didn't last.  I didn't want to have to deal with being a hermit again repeatedly, so I wanted to find something else to use.  The second time I used the 85% lactic acid peel, I wasn't paying as much attention and slathered it on most of my face (except my forehead), including my cheeks and cheekbones.  Then I left it on for 5 minutes.  Yikes!  When I neutralized it with baking soda and water, I could feel the change in my skin on my cheeks.  It seemed puckered and raw!  I was terrified I had blistered my skin!  I slathered coconut oil all over my face and prayed!  Within 2 days, a largish patch (about the size of a half-dollar) was scabbing on my left cheek.  I was able to cover this with makeup, but not very well.  I tried not to pick at the scabs because I didn't want to make matters worse, but on the 3rd or 4th day I couldn't take it anymore!  I finally peeled off the scab, which came off in small pieces.  Thankfully, there was no damage.  BUT, I have noticed a dramatic change in my age spots!  I had almost resigned myself to having to live with caking on concealer and makeup for the rest of my life to cover these dastardly little marks!  I will continue to use this, but with MUCH greater caution!  I have realized that this product will do what I have been searching for, just in small steps, and gently!  If you get this, make sure you test a non conspicuous spot on your face first...then be conservative in future uses.  It will work, but slow and steady is the best way to do this!"
134,B0009MJE74,"Great body wash for dry sensitive skin. Love, love, love this soap.  It's the only thing I can use on my super allergy-sensitive skin.  I'm going to describe what happens to my skin, in case there's someone with these symptoms out there, he/she could try this soap as well.I started having really sensitive skin since about 10 years ago.  Any type of drugstore soap or lotion (Jergens, Vaseline, Dove) will make red spots appear on my skin almost instantaneously.  The spots are perfectly round, perfectly lined up polka dots about a 3/4 cm in diameter each.  Lotions/soaps from the mall were the worst. When the sensitivity first started and I hadn't figured out what was causing it, used to scare the sales persons at The Body Shop and Victoria's Secret because they would try out a lotion on my hand and then the red spots would suddenly appear. Yes, I even tried the ""natural"" stuff too (Aveno, Jergens natural, Olay natural, blah blah)- all of them caused allergic reactions.  The spots don't itch really, but just looks like it might start to one day if I didn't make changes.In ten years, I have found four brands that does not cause a reaction- Burt's Bees, Nubian Heritage, Shea Moisture, and Carol's Daughter.One note I should make at this point- in my opinion, this Nubian Heritage soap feels, works, and smells exactly the same as the Shea Moisture African Black Soap.  The SM soap used to available at Target for about $10 but then they stopped carrying it.  Now, all the stores that carry it sell it for about $30.  That's when I searched around and found this Nubian Heritage African Black Soap.  The ingredients look the same.  I might bet it's the same stuff.When it comes to body washes, Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture black soaps are my absolute favorite.  Not only do they not cause reactions on my skin but they actually make my skin feel better.  They both get rid of any acne that I have and make the skin all smooth.  They rinse clean, yet keep the skin moisturized.  As a bonus surprise, they also got rid of the ingrown hairs i was getting around my knee area- not sure how that happened.  Oh, the smell is great, too.  It's a light licorice scent that makes the shower enjoyable but doesn't stay with you all day, which is what I like.To sum, I hope they never stop making this stuff and I hope the price of this stuff never goes to $30.  I NEED this soap.  Everyone should try it. Love this body wash! Bought it originally from an all natural store then found it at a better price on Amazon! It has made a big difference on mine and my husbands skin! It's very meh. I feel like a lot of these black african soap products aren't as good as they used to be. I used to be a huge user of this brand. No longer My first experience with ""black soap"" was a sample of ""Shea Terra Organic's Rose Hips Black Soap"" (which is around $15-16 for only 4 ounces).Because of the price (vs. amount of product), I thought I'd search for a cheaper alternative, which I thought found in ""Nubian Heritage"" (13 ounces for $6.56 via VitaCost).When I first received it, I decided to first try it on my face (which was the main reason I purchased it). However, because of the strong perfume scent (doesn't seem like it's of a synthetic source, but very potent just the same), I will no longer be using it on my face. Long after I washed it off, I could TASTE it on my lips (and I didn't even intentionally place it there, just rinsing it off must have), and the scent was still very apparent.The ingredient list is INCOMPLETE on here, so here it is:""African Black Soap (palm ash, tamarind extract, plantain peel ?), Cocoamidopropyl Betaine (Coconut Oil Soap), Decyl Glucoside (Sugar Beets), Lauryl Lactylate (Palm Kernel), Deionized Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood), Essential Oil Blend, Jojoba Beads, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Salicylic Acid, Dead Sea Salt, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*. ONLY the Shea Butter, and Aloe are ""Certified Organic"".""Note: Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract is actually a (natural) paraben, for more information go to: organicconsumers (dot) org/articles/article_17679.cfmNubian Heritage Black Soap has a water based gel consistency, and lathers very well with lots of suds...In conclusion, I can tolerate the soap on my body, but when it's gone I don't plan to buy again.________As for ""Shea Terra"" the latter is more thicker and sticky (kind of like molasses), with a slight (pleasant) scent to it as well, but I haven't noticed that it lingered after I washed it off.If you want to know the ingredients in ""Shea Terra"" here it is:""Deionized Water, Yoruba Black Soap (Cocoa Pod Ash, Plantain Peel Ash, Palm Kernel Oil, Camwood Bark), Certified Organic Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Certified Organic Coconut Oil (Cocos Nucifera), Potassium Hydroxide, NOP Certified Organic, Virgin Rose Hip Oil (Rosa Mosqueta), Rose Hip Fruit (Rosa Canina), Aloe Ferrox, Rooibos (Aspalathus Linearis), Kigelli (Kigelia Africana), Certified Organic Marshmallow Root (Althea Officinalis), Licorice Root (Glycryrrhiza Galabra), Citric Acid"" .______Since trying the ""Nubian Heritage"" I again searched for another ""black soap"".This time I ordered ""AAA Shea Butter"" which is $15 w/ PRIME (there is also an 8 oz. available for cheaper). The consistency is smooth/soft, with no black color at all, and best of all-- no strong fragrance!!The ingredients list is quite a bit smaller than the other two. If you go to their website, this is what they have listed: ""Our Liquid Black Soap is made only from Coconut Oil, Palm Oil and Alkaline-Cocoa Potash (obtained by burning Cocoa Pods into ash) and Shea Butter. Our Anti-Bacterial Liquid Black Soap is made from Coconut Oil, Palm Oil and Alkaline-Cocoa Potash (obtained by burning Cocoa Pods into ash), Shea Butter and Neem Oil.""**Just an FYI, Neem Oil has a rather pungent odor (kind of like burnt rubber in my opinion). That's not saying that Neem oil isn't good-- look it up if you don't know!!** This is my new favorite body wash!  Its luxurious, has a pleasant smell, moisturizing and you only need a pea size and it lathers up so much you can wash your entire body and them some!!  I can't wait to try the other scents this company has to offer.  I will definitely be buying again, and again and again! After suffering from acne issues and oily skin on my face neck back and chest for the last 5 years I have tried everything. I have extremely pale and sensitive skin. Doctors have told me I have rosacea, along with other issues and all their treatments never worked for me. Even proactiv didn't help me and everything else seemed to make my acne worse. Nobody told me about this second puberty phenomenon I am experiencing. A girl I met shared a lot of the same issues suggested using the Nubian Heritage African Black soap followed by a coconut oil cleanse every day twice a day. I was hesitant at first since I had tried a million different things and nothing seemed to work and I was giving up hope.Surprisingly this worked very well for me. My acne hasn't disappeared, but it has gotten way better. I have tried different brands of African Black soap, and they all worked alright but this one was by far the best."
135,B000092OX4,"My favorite facial lotion. Light and non greasy. I use this daily.  It is light and not greasy at all. I love this and that it has spf is an added bonus!! I have been using Olay Regenerist skin care products for over 10 years. The three products in this line that I absolutely cannot do without are the Fragrance Free Serum, the Night Cream and now this Moisture Lotion in a pump bottle. After applying the serum (sparingly), I apply the moisture lotion. It goes on smoothly and easily. My skin feels like velvet afterward, and is ready for make up if I choose to wear any. Truly, this is a great moisture lotion, and I prefer it to the cream.I have used quite a number of skin care product lines over the years. Some have been very expensive. None, however, can compare with the results that Olay Regenerist provides. I highly recommend this Moisture Lotion along with the serum and the night cream. I always follow the instructions that were on the package of the first Olay Regenerist products that I bought years ago: Use Sparingly. If you want to know what product(s) to start with, I would suggest the serum and the moisture lotion. Both come in convenient pump bottles that dispense just what you need. Typically, a bottle of the serum lasts me between 3 to 4 months. I expect that the moisture lotion will last the same amount of time.One caution: Be sure that your product arrives in a sealed Olay box, and that the product is made in Ohio. That will ensure that it is made by Olay and is not a knock-off. This Olay moisturizer with sunscreen is excellent! My daughter & I apply it everyday. It’s not oily & the scent is light. Will continued to purchase this. Works well, for me excellent sun protection &  good for my very sensitive skin. I usually put on my face and upper arms which look great . After being in sun several weeks I noticed my lower arms , hands and lower legs  where I didn’t use lotion have dark sun spots  and  freckles. The places I usually use the lotion on including my face, upper arms and upper legs looks smooth and uniform color, no wrinkles, age spots or , freckles treated skin looks 100% better than non treated! Ordered another bottle !  I also use on vacation in Caribbean and it helps prevents sunburn I use moisture whip 40 spf  on face and shoulders in strong sun.I recommend this productB I am about to order this product again after many years of using it.  At the age of 89, I still like to care for my skin.  At such an advanced age, my skin looks pretty good.  I don't understand the comments about fragrance.  I don't find that at all.  And yes, my nose still works well.  Recently, the skin on my feet was rough and cracked.  No hand lotion or foot product helped at all.  I decided to use the Olay Regenerist on my feet.  It worked wonders.  The skin is now soft and smooth with no cracks.  I am not recommending this lotion for feet---just the face and neck.  However, my feet are so much better.  Thanks, Amazon, for letting me review Olay Regenerist. Most people won't listen to someone my age.  Go 90 ! I’m a Black woman in my mid-40s with sensitive skin. I rarely wear makeup, and tend to be super low maintenance when it comes to skin care overall. 9 days out of ten, I wash my face, slap on moisturizer, and call it a day. I’m also super neglectful when it comes to sunscreen (I’m not proud of it).As I reached 40, I realized it might be a good idea to switch from Oil of Olay for sensitive skin to some sort of “anti-aging” moisturizer, asked around, looked around, and decided to give the Regenerist line a try.I’m glad I did. It is unobtrusive, but does the job. It doesn’t make my skin break out or itch (two reactions I’ve had in the past), and the smell is mild, IMO. If I do decide to add makeup, it doesn’t make it look or feel weird or blotchy.It also lasts quite a long time: one and a half pumps is enough to cover my face and neck."
136,B00008CMOS,"Love this masque! Fast shipping. This stuff works great. It’s so hard to find now. Most of the so called mud masks are the kind that dry and then just peel off your skin. That’s convenient but this stuff is actual clay, not mud. The manufacturer should change the name to clay mask but of course mud mask just sounds better. This product is thick like clay and a little goes a long way. It really does a great job of removing fine lines and toxins from your skin. It also adds a healthy glow to your face after you’ve washed it off with water and a wash cloth. I let my mask stay on my skin for over a half hour. The stuff is not expensive and it works great. The product that I just received has the same texture and scent of the Queen Helene mud masks from years ago. Big cosmetic companies may not want you to know about this product, which may be the reason why it’s so hard to find now. The scent is okay if you like flower smells. For both the original and the newer version have a flower scent. For those of you who hate scents be ware. I rate this a 2 star because it wasn’t like the original clay mask I bought a few years ago. The original clay mask was thicker and it would harden and not come off while I slept. The newer version is to creamy and  it would wear off after a few hours or when I went to take it off in the morning. How I used this product, basically, I use it only on the areas of my skin that is greasy and on my pimples. I’ve tried other mask products on my skin but they dry out my skin or make it itchy. Some acne masks have an ingredient that I am allergic to, so when I use it my skin itches and I have to take a Benadryl for 2 days straight to help me with the redness and itchiness. I used the original product would stay on my face to soak up the oils and help me dry out my acne. It was organic and the ingredients were safe enough for me to use. With this newer version it’s more creamy takes more time to dry and to harden.  Sometimes if the oils on the skin is to greasy the product will wipe off, unlike the original that hardens fast and doesn’t come off. Both the original product and the newer version are meant to apply to the face wait about 5-30 minutes and wipe off after it drys. If you are looking for something natural with no harsh chemicals, that will clean the face fast then this is the product. For me I got the older version to do certain things that I find the newer version  can’t do which is a bummer for me. I will continue to buy the new version because the older version is no longer available and I have nothing else to use. . I don’t like other masks that you find at a drug store because  many are to harsh which causes redness and dryness. It’s Not that the newer product is good, I mean, it’s  okay but if I find something better then yes, I will switch in a heart beat. This product is good for all skin types. I have sensitive skin that can sometimes be dry. This mud mask does not have a strong fragrance, will not dry your skin out and leaves your skin very soft. It will detoxify your skin and improve texture. I’ve been using this product for about 20 years or so and it works incredibly well. My grandmother used it too, and it was at her suggestion that I try it. My skin feels smooth and clean, and my pores and wrinkles seem to be less prominent.  I don’t use it more than once per month. In my experience, it works better than other masks, including those that are in say the $35-75 range. I love clay masks. This one is affordable and contains bentonite, which in this day in age is important for one reason: radiation. We clever humans are bombarded on a daily basis by radiation by computers and cell phones, and hey, now we have the nuclear situation in Japan, which whether you like it or not affects the health of the world, let's not kid ourselves. The good news is there are various ways to protect ourselves, do a little research. One is bentonite clay. You can and should take it in pill form, but smearing it on your face acts as a form of detox and cleans your pores in the process. The only issue I see with this particular brand is the Propylene Glycol that is in it. It is unhealthy and has a drying affect, which my combination skin does not like at all. I also have sensitive skin. For that reason, I will be looking for a more soothing, more natural brand. My skin looks better for about a day after using this, which is why I only use it before events (weddings, etc)otherwise I get blemishes later. I think it is because the crud gets sucked out of my pores and ends up either getting partially stuck on the way out or just reeks havoc upon leaving my skin. Also, it makes my nose pores ooze oil for a bit. I find that annoying. This formula irritates me a little, like a mild burning sensation, which I am sure they could find a way to make that problem disappear by just removing the harsh glycol. I am thinking of messing with it, adding an ingredient to fix it somehow.I wish the makers read my review and did something. I can dream, can't I? Mom has used for years & I’m hooked too! Apart from a few iffy ingredients like methylparaben (an estrogenic) and linalool (potential skin irritant), this is a reasonably good clay mask that's real bang for the buck. I used this as a teenager and it's basically how I remember it: Same light scent (not overwhelming - I'm sensitive to fragrance). Same pink-brown color. Knowing what I do now about cosmetic ingredients, I'd normally steer clear of anything with parabens, but as this is something I apply infrequently and rinse off I'm okay with compromising. A thin layer is all I need and it wipes off easily with a wash cloth, unlike other stubborn clay masks I've used. And unlike some of those other masks, this actually seems to somewhat minimize pores, remove excess oil, and really brightens my skin. The soft glow on my face afterward is well worth it."
137,B000GZES7A,"Wish the size was bigee I have used this product for over 20 years. People tell me I have beautiful skin. This product is part of that glow. Seriously the best eye cream on the market. I use to avoid the coon dog droopy eyes, that run in my family. My daughter got tricked into a Mary Kay setup when she thought she won a thing for free facials for her bridal party. I guess that is common occurrence. For that alone I really should refuse to use their products. The gal did get us to buy a few overpriced items that either don’t do as they claim or we just don’t like. But this one I kinda did like. A container lasts about 3 months and nice to get it on Amazon because even though I do like it, I don’t want to buy it from reps who trick young girs into going to their Mary Kay parties. I don’t know if it would be necessary for 20 year girls which is how old most the girls there were. But for us moms it’s not bad. This had tracking info within a day, arrived within a couple of days and was exactly what I wanted. Great seller, thank you!For anyone wondering what this cream is, it's the last part of the TimeWise Miracle Set (Facewash, Day/Night Cream, Moisturizer). It's intended for use at both night time and morning applications before applying the moisturizer. The effects include removing lines and helping your eye makeup stay in place. It removes dark circles and evens the complexion around the eyes with time. It also feels really nice!The eye revitalizer which is their similar but separate eye cream is used to target puffiness and dark circles in addition to what the Firming Eye Cream does. Though to be honest, nothing compares to the soothing eye gel for immediate and drastic puffy relief. (Their pitch is ""it's great for after crying"" and it is!) I bought this product after I ran out of an eye cream I had been using for a couple of years that worked well.  I wanted to find a cream that was just as good if not better and decided on this product after reading all the great reviews about it and because the price was much more reasonable compared to other eye creams.After using this product for two months, I can honestly say that it has done nothing to improve the darkness or fine lines underneath my eyes.  (I suspect it might even be making them worse.)I used the cream everyday at night before bed and underneath my makeup (missha bb cream & powder makeup).  The cream feels tacky when applied to the under eye area and does not have the smooth consistency of lotion or it's ability to sink into the skin, instead this cream feels a bit heavy and like it sits on your skin.  It provides some temporary moisture to the eye area after initially applied, but the little moisture it does provide is lost when makeup is applied over it and it doesn't have any long term improvements to the skin.The cream tends to dry up and harden where it dispenses from the nozzle after each use and you lose a little bit of product from this.  Aside from that the only good things about this cream are the low price, no fragrance/scent, and it doesn't give you milia.I recommend people pass on this product and try something else.tldr;Pros:-cheap-unscented-does not give you miliaCons:-does nothing for wrinkles or dark circles I've used this before, so I knew what it was. It is nice & creamy.  You don't need to use much.  A whole pump is almost too much.  Unfortunately; I recently discovered why my eyes are constantly watering.  T'would be this product.  I will try it just under my eyes and see if that is any better.  It took a year's use before I began having the issue. This seems to really work for me. My undereye is puffy and dark. After first time I tried for a month I thought hmmmm I think under my eyes look better.  I have since ordered 3 more thru the months. I really like.  Im 65 so no its not going to make it look like when you were 16 but I can tell a difference after using for myself. Everyone likes different undereye cream. So far this has been my favorite"
138,B0002XBTVO,"I used to use the pca moisturizer with spf in it but it was feeling a tad heavy and I wanted to try something more lightweight that was for every day use and I love this! I’ll probably keep both on hand at home. For anyone who struggles with combination skin this is perfect for you. My skin is dry & gets oily as the day goes on.. I love that this product is VERY light does not feel oily and makes my skin feel smooth. I have been using this for about a week now and I am very happy. For the last two years, I was using murad water hydration and I may like this better. Non-irritating, no oil, no real scent As an African American 24 year old, lighter skinned woman, this product was a Godsend! I deal with both food allergy related (dairy, sugar, soy, yeast) acne and cystic acne that comes and goes according to what I eat and how much rest I am able to get.After going through a period of eating very poorly and my skin not reacting well to mainly organic methods of treatment (oils, remedies ect), I decided to give Clear Skin a try after finding it through googling best acne products of 2015/2016.The reviews looked pretty good and it had placed in a few magazine best beauty buy listings so I ordered my first jar. At the time, I was already using a CVS brand advanced acne spot treatment and Cetiphil Anti-bacterial soap which both were helping to clean up some of the congestion that was concurring with my acne post-eating for a good month without any concern for my food allergies.I started using this product and the rest is history! One of my main draws was the attention it gives to pores and the anti-bacterial bit. After going to a holistic doctor, I learned that a lot of my acne was 1) food related 2) a result of an over production of yeast (which is a bacteria) so the anti-bacterial quality of the product was a win-win along with my anti-bacterial Cetiphil soap.I saw an improvement in a about a week or so by adding this product at night to my CVS and Cetiphil regimen.I also reved up my results by giving Sea Buckthorn oil a try on a rotation of every other night (Sea Buckthorn oil one night, PCA Clear Skin product, the next night) and my face was almost completely clear!***Know that I also got back on my healthier eating plan to really cement the results which is the root cause of most of my acne.The Clean skin gel refined my pores and helped clear the small rash like patches of small red bumps or white heads and the oil helped to balance the moisture needs without being greasy or clogging my pores.Take note that I also tried this product in the winter/colder months so that can play into how well your skin receives a product depending on its' condition in that season.------------ Summer update:So the unfortunate thing about seasons and my skin in general is that it tends to need different things for different climates.I have gotten through (3) bottles of PCA Clear Skin and though the results were shining in the beginning, my skin is now used to the product and not getting any big results. This is expected and I plan to keep it on my list of go-to products for when the seasons change and the time comes for me to switch up my product collection again.Overall, I would highly recommend that you try this product. Whether you start out every other day or every day, it should show you some results within a week or two. I know all too well that every product doesn't work for every face, but I'm hoping this works for you!Good luck! It’s a very lightweight cream. It has no smell which is good.I don’t think it’s anything that an aveeno cream can’t do better. I was recommended this brand when I would get monthly facials. I suffer from adult acne and because of other products I use, my skin can get dry even though it’s naturally oily. I love this for a morning moisturizer cause it’s lightweight, and you don’t need a whole lot. My skin doesn’t get irritated when I use this cause it’s not fragrances. Overall, I’ve been using this a couple years and love it. This is the best moisturizer for my skin! My skin is sensitive to fragrance and prone to breakouts. This moisturizer treats breakouts, prevents new ones, reduces redness and is also fragrance free! Although the price is high, it is worth every penny. I would rather spend money on products that provide results than on junk that doesn't work. I'm 23 and have had so many issues with acne, especially over the past year. I've tried different routines, moisturizers recommended by dermatologists and nothing has worked long term. I entirely changed up my routine - which may contribute to how well this works for me as well. I now use coconut oil to wash my face, this moisturizer and the PCA Nutrient Toner as well. My face started to become completely and more consistently clear within a month. I've minimally been wearing make up as well (shout out to quarantining!).Only thing is, when I do wear make up I can't use this moisturizer directly before, it needs to soak in more or else the moisturizer balls up when I try to apply foundation. Thankfully the moisturizer is lightweight so I don't have to wait too long for it to soak in. Also, the price is a bit high for me but when it comes to my skin it's definitely worth it to me. The product seems to last me about 2 months, and that's with using it every day, twice a day."
139,B000052YMR,"I'm going to review two products.Bit about me, I'm nearing my 40's, dry to normal skin, live in Wisconsin where the winters dry out my skin and summers make it normal.CeraVe: moisturizing cream (normal to dry)my first tub.When you open this product it looks shiny & slimy  (at least to me). When applying it feels very tacky, doesn't go on smoothly and I feel I have to use more product  (compared to cetaphil)It drys very fast and you can't even tell you put it on. Skin is well moisturized with no lotion feel to it. I like to use this on my face under makeup and under my fake tanner. It works great! My skin feels well moisturized all day long with this product.Update june 2017. So I still agree with above but I would breakout once in a while. I chucked it up to being a mom, stress, kids. I've stopped using it on my face and I now hardly ever break out. I'm not positive if it's the product but I don't love it as much as cetaphil and once I've used it up will not buy it again. Give 3 stars.Cetaphil: moisturizing cream (dry & sensitive skin)my second tub. (Well I need to buy my 3rd tub)When you open this you can tell it's very very thick & creamy. The texture is creamy & greasy.  A little bit will go a long way. When applying it's easy to keep spreading it. It gives my skin a glow to it. I love how it looks on my body. This has been my go to summer moisturizer. It gives that dewy look. I do feel my makeup will not last as long but I still like to use it on my face.I ran out of this in spring and got CeraVe but felt like something was missing. I'm on my second tub now.June2017  update: still love it and need to order my 3rd tub...I can see pros and cons to both. A manly man may not like cetaphil  (or maybe) or you may not like the slight greasy feel of it well working with hands or outdoors.With my dry skin I love it. It makes your skin look healthy & glowing. A little goes a long way. Everyone I know, knows that I primarily use Cetaphil. I buy it in bulk when it's on sale, especially in dry winter months!As far as lotions and creams go, there's no other for me. Cerave is great, but Cetaphil is better for me personally. I wouldn't dare use any other brand - not even Aquaphor, not even Nivea - because they all break me out or prove ineffective for my ridiculously sensitive, ridiculously dry, ridiculously pathetic skin. I've even used the store-brand versions of Cetaphil and they don't entirely compare. If they're on sale, they're good enough for body but it's this brand only for my face.When they updated the packaging recently (2016), they added ""great for body!"" to it. Yes, the primary use for this is body... but I also use it on my face, and always have. They do make a face lotion, but I prefer this cream. I've heard some find it too ""heavy"" for facial use but I don't really feel that way (if you do, Cerave is a more ""whipped"" light option while still being ultra intensive). When I apply it to very dry areas, I usually reaaaally work it in massaging it into my skin, at least twice a day, and it really does the trick.They also make body wash, two facial cleansers (one for acne prone skin), multiple lotions and creams, cleansing wipes (good for makeup removal), bar soap, facial moisturiser with SPF, some baby products, and a ""men's"" line. ALL of the products are great and not gimmicky with the exception of the ""for men"" line... come on now. Cetaphil is for every gender, get over it. If you have sensitive skin, it's worth the extra few bucks for Cetaphil cleanser or bar soap. moisturizing Para la dermatitis y más específico para la piel seca y cuarteada que sangran es lo máximo.Este producto cambio la vida de mi esposa Love this for very dry skin I have very dry and extremely sensitive skin.  I've been searching seemingly forever for a lotion that is both mild and effective.  Honestly, I'd basically given up hope on finding what I wanted and had mostly stopped even trying.  Recently, though, I came across a recommendation for this cream, and it was convincing enough that I was willing to give it a shot.  I am so glad I did.This cream is a bit heavy and a little goes a long way, but it's *so* effective!  It manages to be very easy on my skin while still helping clear up even the extremely dry, winter-battered patches.  With this, I did one application on my hands, and the next day, they were very noticeably improved.  No other lotion I've tried has done that.  Most lotions just moisturize while they're on the skin, but as soon as they wear off, my skin looks almost as bad as it did before.  This one actually made my skin itself better.  I'm done looking -- this is the one for me. I like this product it is good for my sensitive skin. Plus it keeps it keeps it from being dry, Thus my eczema does not flair. Up. I use it on my face also"
140,B0015Z90NC,"I don't know if this is a good La Mer dupe, because I haven't used La Mer and won't spend that on a skin cream. I have used fermented kelp before without good results, so the formula does matter. Anyway, my skin was in great shape having come from a climate my skin loves, and then bam! I hit low humidity and low temps this winter, and my skin was a mess in days. Scaly and painful. I ordered this and within a few more days, my skin was healing. It's not where it was from the good weather and probably won't be, but this was almost miraculous in helping my skin recover. The smell doesn't bother me, so I'm not sure what all that drama is about. I had this stuff a long time ago and would use it for EVERYTHING. It's great for dry, irritated and itchy skin, I use it as a nightly lip mask, and even to heal sores or scabs that are struggling to heal on their own. It's amazing and I'm so glad to finally have more. Highly recommend Just what my winter skin needed. After working outside all day in this dry, cold climate, my skin was craving nourishment! This calmed the redness and also made my skin so soft and supple. I will continue to purchase this and most of the MB line. Nice value and la Mer like. My skin is dry and fighting wrinkles. This will be my go to face cream for life! A lot of creams and moisturizer reviews point to the big gaping hole and I got to experience it with this product. I am not sure if the product settles a certain way when laid sideways to create this hole or an intentionally induced air bubble to dupe customers of product. It is touted as the dupe of crème de la mer so I had to try it. Not that I tried the original, I cannot afford to spend that much on a face cream. This product is deeply moisturizing, thicker night cream. Unless your skin is very dry this is not appropriate for daytime. I have combination skin with an oily t zone. Scent is mild. Cream spreads easily. Have I seen any phenomenal results, maybe not. That’s my take. I'm nearly 58 years old. I started menopause at 55 and within 5 months my skin went from combination to a dry desert. I can not tell you how many creams, lotions and oils I have tried. I was visiting my daughter, who had been given a jar of the Mario Badescu protein night cream by a skin care specialist, and she said it was too much for her, (she is 32, has occasional breakouts but overall has beautiful skin). So, she gave it to me. That was it!! It is wonderful! I cleanse at night and apply the cream. When I wake up I am glowing and moisturized. Thank you for this wonderful product. I will be a customer for life! Please do NOT alter or change it, it is perfect!!! Just for reference - I’m 39 years old. And I have been into face creams for a few years now. I first started with the rose water from this brand. And that alone has been incredible on my skin. My skin literally glows. So I decided to try this one. I’ve been on it for almost 3 weeks now and wow wow wow. I can’t believe a product that it’s so affordable can work this well. My skin is as smooth as ever. And again glowing! I have received compliments on my skin constantly. It’s just unbelievable how good this seaweed face cream is. Do not hesitate - just get it and start using it !!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥸"
141,B00008ZPG9,"Have been using it a long time using product for many years I have used this moisturizer for many years.  I keep thinking that there must be something better, or certainly cheaper, OR, with more earth friendly packaging—-so try at least a couple new products a year and still, I end up coming back to this one.To me, it is a mid to heavy moisturizer.  I have heard and seen others describe it as light weight.  Compared to other products I have tried, the texture is more like a night cream (heavier).  It is certainly heavier than many of the expensive department store brands and heavier than most hand lotions, etc.I stopped noticing the scent long ago, but it has a mildly medicinal/chemical scent overlaid with a light floral (rose maybe?). The scent totally dissipates in just a few minutes.  Scents frequently bother my allergies and this one doesn’t.  It absorbs quickly and wears quite nicely under the BB that I use as a foundation.  No waiting around for it to absorb before moving to the next step in my routine.I use this on my face, neck, décolletage, and my hands (cuz Grama always said to do the same thing to my my hands as I do to my face).My only complaints:  1.  the packaging!!!  This is terribly over packaged.  And it seems to come in a variety of different packaging (weirdly) .  I want a simple GLASS jar/bottle, possibly in a paperboard box.  There is NO need for a pump bottle that is difficult or impossible to recycle!  2.  No SPF.  Every facial moisturizer should have SPF. Love it, I have been using OLAY regeneraste all my life and is the only cream that does not irritate my skin sensitive skin I have been an Oil of Olay user for decades and this is my favorite so far. Makes my 60 year old skin look and feel young. ✨️ I've used Olay Regenerist since it came out many years ago.  The product has remained part of my routine twice a day since. It's light going on and  remains  all day and night. I definitely recommend it if you have slight lines, for plumping up and overall skin care. I have been using Oil of Olay products since I was in my teens. I am now in my sixties and they never disappoint. I suggest buying the entire line base on the product line. Regenertist works very well with my aging skin my skin is brighter and firmer. As an African American our skin so diverse depending on our complexion and other factors our skin can be super sensitive. Over the decades I have tried a myriad of facial products from Mary Kay to L’Oreal to Clinique, yet I keep going back to Oil of Olay.My suggestion is to go to their website, take the quiz, and understand what kind of skin you have. What I would really like to see is an Oil of Olay product line that is more natural ingredients and less chemicals. Decided to get this on Amazon as I couldnt get it anywhere in store. The color is a bit different from what I am accustomed to and feels off and caused me to break out a little. I am still using it to see the long term effects and will update my review accordingly."
142,B000YIVSMW,"I see a lot of reviews saying this is fake product, I can’t speak to what product they received, but Kiss My Face was acquired by Aliph Brands in 2019 because KMF was going out of business. The formula has changed, but I do think they tried to stay true as much as possible to the old product while maintaining a budget. It’s not quite as moisturizing and skin-saving as it was prior to the change, which is disappointing. I used to rely on the Calendula lotion in winter, it was the only thing that worked on my dry sensitive skin. It’s still fairly good, and I like that it’s still “natural”, but if you’re looking for the old version, sadly it is no more. This lotion is still pretty good, just not quite as moisturizing. I found out about this lotion when I was at a friends house and needed some lotion for my hands. She gave me a few squirts of this lotion that smells so good and goes on nice and silky.I ended up snapping a pic and as I was browsing saw Amazon sold it and boom I’m hooked!!Love how it doesn’t make me feel slimy and it’s not to thick . Fast delivery and great communication with seller !! I can't say enough wonderful things about this lotion. If you like soft, smooth, non-irritated, moisturized skin, you need to have this lotion. It's gentle, has a nice enough smell (I wish it was more honey and less herby) that isn't too obnoxious and it leaves your skin super moisturized for up to 48 hours. Not only does it soften the skin, it smooths it too, so if you have dry or rough patches, or areas (like elbows and knees) that don't feel as smooth as you'd like, this is excellent for those. It melts into the skin very easily and leaves a soft, natural, non-greasy finish. I've used this on my combination skin face too and it's not made me extra greasy or dry or worse yet broken me out. I've never been able to use body lotion of my face, but I can definitely use this. Rather it soothed and softened an irritated patch right under my eye. I think this lotion and the other one I've tried from this brand (Peaches & Cream) are awesome and I'm looking forward to trying more from Kiss My Face. This lotion makes my skin feel very nice. I like that it comes in a big bottle with easy pump which was priced right. The lotion is silky and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. It contains no parabens, phthalates or SLS and is full of healthy essential oils. I only gave this 4 stars because the scent was a little sweeter than I had expected (although, to be fair, it is HONEY and calendula). It's still a lovely scent and would be nice as an overall body lotion. I had originally planned to use this as face lotion, hence why the scent was a bit too pungent for my needs. Again though, the product is very nice and you shouldn't let that stop you if you like the scent of honey and calendula and especially if you plan to use as a body lotion rather than face lotion. I would recommend this. I had purchased a smaller version of this lotion at Whole Foods so I knew how the product was before I bought it. It's one of the best lotions ever!!!! I have super sensitive skin that is really dry, especially on my legs in the winter. When  use this product, it never causes me any problems and moisturizes my skin for days.  It isn't greasy and has a nice faint smell of honey. Just as a warning, due to the type of lotion it takes a bit to rub it in fully. This is not something you would use unless you have the time to rub it in fully, because it leaves white streaks until it's absorbed.The vendor had this out to me very quickly. I absolutely love the larger size. The Whole Foods selection is a much smaller tube for about the same amount of money. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an intensive, thicker lotion. The product seems less moisturizing than it was before when purchased at a grocery store and I noticed now they want to charge you double for extra moisturizer kiss my face, which was normally very moisturizing, I don’t know if they changed the formula To make more money Every autumn as the weather gets drier I buy a bottle of this lotion.  It WAS thick and creamy and smelled subtle and lovely.  Apparently KMF was bought out and is in some sort of transition... but this is NOT the same lotion, at all.  It's watery in comparison and smells like mall-store-teenage-girl vanilla.  It's awful.  Moisturizes tolerably well but just disappointed overall.  I will look for it in local shops so I can sniff it first but if you dig cheap scents then by all means, go ahead and buy it. The lotion has a great texture... I am still getting used to smell, which turned out to be not one of my favourite smells. It does have a smell of honey in it, but also calendula. I would prefer those 2 flavors not to be mixed. I think I will eventually get used to it. Rather then that, great lotion, makes my hands smooth, I reapply it through out the day, and a big bottle and a pump style is a great plus."
143,B000ILKUZ6,"This is very moisturizing and makes my skin incredibly soft and gives it a healthy glow. Great for softening or massaging normal to dry skin. Be aware that it leaves a slightly greasy residue (it’s oil) so if you’re not used to it or don’t like the feeling, maybe it isn’t for you, but I personally like the texture. The scent reminds me of an oat milk bath. I took off one star because it was leaking when I opened the package and left the bottle feeling greasy for a while. Shipped fast. Very happy I purchased, I have dry itchy skin. Quite soothing, with no sticky feeling. I’ve been using this for years - it goes on best after showering ! Love the product and have used it for years. The plastic bag it came in inside the box was torn open, lid came loose and the oil spilled onto the other items in the box and soaked through the shipping box. Amazon of course will replace, but this isn't the first time this has happened.  This was a blind buy and I was hesitant till I read the reviews. I usually use palmer cocoa butter oil or neutragena sesame seed oil. The consistency of the oil isn't too thick and absorbs fast. It also has an amazing sweet nutty smell!!! It keeps my skin moisturized all day and I will be purchasing more in the future!! Product is great…shipped poorly.  Leaked and wasted product. Despite packaging and sticker across the top it arrived spilt in the box and over another item I had bought. It leaked out a considerable amount but still going to give the oil a go. It doesn't have a scent really or that I can smell. Leaves skin Shiney"
144,B001CJE0MC,"Love the fact that sun protection stays during a real workout, yet never feels heavy or greasy.  It works because my dermatologist always commends me on the condition of my nonburned fair skin.  For me, it's a must have. Finding the perfect sunscreen was like finding the Holy Grail for me.  My esthetician was definitely for the zinc oxide versus the chemical ingredients that most sunscreens have.  I needed a sunscreen that had at least a 30SPF, didn't clog my pours and didn't suck my skin dry.  A lot of the zinc oxide stuff does that.  Being a lover of tinted sunscreens, I've tried the Clinique City Block, Anessa (Shisedo brand) tinted sunblock, Dermalogicala tinted sunblock (works great, but alas, only SPF15), Neutrogena, you name it - the only thing left to do was to smear mud on my face.  Fortunately, I didn't have to, cuz I found Skinceuticals Sport UV SPF45 sunscreen.Yes, the stuff is chalky and yes, it's a bit on the oily side, but the stuff absorbs quickly and lasts a good while.  My first 3-oz tube lasted the whole summer in tropical and polluted China.  I still have enough for at least a month, but decided to purchase another tube while shopping for other stuff on Amazon.  A great find, well worth the money, but probably more suited to mature skin types. I bought the wrong product. That being said, it costs a lot so I still use it. If I didn't put makeup on over it, I would be disappointed as it leaves a white film on your face. It is also pretty heavy. As it is winter and I use it under makeup, it will do but as spring approaches, I could not continue with this product. I generally love the Skinceutical products and will need to get the product I intended. I’ve used Skinceutical sunscreen for years. I began after retinol use for blemishes when I wanted to be in the sun but wanted super protection. In my opinion, it is the best. I use it daily as a sunscreen and moisturizer for my dry skin. Can’t do without it! I love this product. I use it on my face every single day rain, shine or snow. Great non greasy way to protect yourself!! And I live in Maine! I use this sunscreen because it was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I am out every Saturday, riding my road bike in the Houston sun and heat. It gives me great coverage.  My skin is on the sensitive side, ready to breakout.  With this product my pores will get slightly plugged but I don't breakout.  I don't put it on my forehead because it will eventually run into my eyes from all the sweating I do. To combat the plugged pores I get a good facial every 6 weeks. It is cheaper to buy it here than from a dermatologist's office. This product contained the following ingredients not in the advertising that are toxic.Avobenzone Containing Sunscreens can cause hormone disruption - and are even more toxic when exposed to chlorineAvobenzone degrades when it is exposed to the sun which results in harmful free radicals being released into the body. These free radicals can accelerate the aging process and increase the risk of illness including cancer. Making this worse, because of its short life - Avobenzone is always linked with other chemical ingredients, Octocrylene, Homosalate or Octisalate, to stabilize it, which each have dangerous side effects:Octocrylene is often found in sunscreens with Avobenzone. Too much of this chemical can have harmful side effects. It is efficient at absorbing into the skin and can penetrate to the deepest layers of the skin. This deep absorption leads to interactions with other chemicals which cause changes deep in the skin, producing oxygen radicals that can lead to cell death and may be implicated in cardiovascular disease . I began using this product several years ago on the recommendation of a skin specialist.  I had very dark melasma/hyperpigmentation on both cheeks. Being allergic to hydroquinone it was recommended that I use the skin ceutical products.  The first thing I liked about this product is that it was easily absorbed, unlike other sunscreens that are too thick or remain white on the skin.  My mature skin loves the moisturing effect and now years later there is very little evidence of the melasma. I usually have to point it out to people. To some the price of this product may seem a little extravagant but a little goes a long way. Depending on your usage this tube can last a few months."
145,B00199YUBG,"I read about this product a few months ago.  My budget has been so tight, I added it to my wish list to make sure I didn’t forget the brand name, after reading so many positive reviews.  I was finally ableto squeeze out the $10 to order it!I have struggled with post menopausal acne on and off for 10 years.  The last few years have been hell. First, I developed Angular Cheilitis (mouth corner cracks).  I used to get them from my head gear. They take forever to heal.  After a lot of research,  I managed to clear that pesky issue up with a B2 supplement and a collegian ointment I found on Amazon.  Next - deep painful ‘won’t come to a head’ patches on the right side of my skin. I saw a dermatologist for that issue during the first year of the pandemic.  She was standing so far away when I removed my mask, she would have needed binoculars to see my skin and said I had Impetigo. It was clearly NOT Impetigo.  I tried the wash, liquid antibiotic and Mupirocin ointment prescribed, but it did very little. I had used the prescription ointment on an infected tattoo years earlier. It’s strong enough for staph, but did little for my face. Eventually by some miracle that side cleared up. Then a completely different type of acne took over the left side of my chin. I had minor breakouts in my teens, but NOTHING like what’s been going on with my chin for way too long!After receiving the ointment a week ago. Within a couple days, I could see it was clearing up and helping with scarring from the past few years. Being post menopausal, coarse hair appears on my chin out of nowhere.  These pesky hairs definitely cause issues of their own in zit land. I have plates in my neck. I can’t raise my head enough to be accurate on the bottom of my chin and have made many holes in my skin with the tweezers. Much of the time it’s ingrown city and by the time I’m done with my tweezers, a bloody mess.I haven’t had an ingrown since using the ointment.I also used it on a cat scratch. I’m a slow healer, but within a couple days the scratch was barely visible.  I wish I had it after being bit by a black widow spider last summer. I had a hole in my skin the size of a half dollar coin.  Took months to heal.I was a bit dismayed at how tiny the jar was, but a dab goes a long way! Too much can leave the areagreasy, so I recommend starting with a minuscule amount and massage it into the skin lightly.  I find the smell of tea tree pleasant.  The scent isn’t overly strong.  I read it’s great for mosquito and other bug bites.  I hope that part is true.  I have scratched myself so hard, I bruised my skin many times over! Fingers crossed!  I definitely recommend picking up a jar of Desert Essence Soothing Skin Ointment!! Good Value, Works! I use this for everything! For anyone that has ever seen the movie ""My big fat Greek wedding"", this is my Windex. Cuts, burns, bug bites, diaper rash, cysts (brings to a head or opens overnight) and so much more! Purchased this for healing my sensitive, infection prone cuticles but let me tell you - this stuff has been amazing on several occasions. Notably when my son came home with a staph infection on his arm from the beach, in a panic I put some of the Tea Tree Oil Skin Ointment and it immediately began to help heal. We went to a doctor the next day where he was given what was essentially a stronger Neosporin, but this only made it worse. I switched back to the tea tree ointment and amazingly, the wound healed within days. So grateful that I gave this a try. The smell is not so great but the medicinal benefits are well worth the purchase. Really works great and the smells not to bad. Good stuff I did not like the skin ointment. It was greasy and smelled of menthol. Not a product I would buy again. Was looking for a great natural skin moisturizer, for my hands. I had read other reviews about this and decided to try it. I figured what could it hurt ? I am so glad that I did try it ! It's been a few months and now I'm on my second or third jar. I used it to moisturize my hands, arms, legs, feet, and lips. Yes, you can use it as a chapstick ! I have not tried it on my face because I think it may be to oily for my face. It soaks in very quickly, and I feel that it does a good job of keeping my skin soft, and my lips soft and protected. Skin irritations go away pretty much instantly. Small cuts, and bruises go away within two or three days. It takes the sting out of insect bites. Pimples, it does not cure quickly for me. I wish it did, however, it does work well on making pimples go away faster and so that they are not so inflammed and red. I got bit by a tick (first time ever) and rubbed some of this ointment on it immediately. It did not itch as long as I put this cream on and I've been told that tick bites itch like crazy, and the actual tick bite/bump went away in about 2 days. I used it on my dog between her toes to relieve a skin irritation, and I think she really liked it. The redness went away in ONE day. I thought this was amazing because my dog has skin issues. Also, she did not like the tase or smell so she did not lick it off. I actually like the smell, lavender is an ingredient. It is not strong at all. Now I feel like this is a must have in my house !!"
146,B0017P7BOA,"I wish the product had either more of the original Dove bar scent or a different scent.  It is not unpleasant, just not really clean smelling or perfume like either.  May be good for those who like a light scent. I use this to shave my legs and it leaves them looking soft and smooth. The scent is mild but clean - not to overwhelming. The consistency is the perfect amount of thickness and the exfoliating sea minerals is an amazing added texture. My skin is definitely smoother after using! About the only brand I use for body wash and it makes my skin so soft. You can’t go wrong with dove soap. Smells great and leaves skin super soft. It took a while to get used to not having those luxurious blue exfoliating beads and the new scent, but now I absolutely love it! I like the cleanliness of my skin after using Dove Body Wash.  I like the fragrance too! My husband even uses this now because he likes the exfoliating to cleanse dead skin. IT smells great and does not irritate my skin. Not to mention it lasts such a long time😍"
147,B0000UTUW4,"I really love Meyers soaps and was excited to try this scent for the first time. Plus 6 for $22 seemed like a great price. Unfortunately, once I received the item I quickly realized the bottles don't come completely full. So I didn't get the full 12.5 oz quantity expected. The scent is amazing but the lack of product is disappointing... I ordered 6 bottles of this hand soap and received the shipment today (7/29/22). The lid was askew on one bottle and 3/4 of the soap in this bottle leaked on the inside of the box and down the side of said bottle.  I am requesting either a refund for this bottle or a full replacement.  Thank you. It’s just too strong of a smell The various scents are excellent, the lather and cleans your hands really well. I can't recommend this brand enough. Great soap ,great scent. It was packaged so poorly rolling around in too big a box that the pump no longer worked when I took it out, there was leakage.  Luckily I had an almost empty bottle of same and was able to pour it into the old bottle.  There was no fillerin the far too big box.  smaller box with no fillers would have been better. I'm giving the product 5 stars, however I ordered the 6 pack of Mrs. Meyer's hand soap and today received only one hand soap that had leaked inside the box it arrived in.  Now I see it's no longer in stock.  I sure hope I'm not being charged for 6! What a wonderful scent!"

149,B001ET7FL8,"With all the concerns of viruses and flus and washing hands with Antibacterial washes, we Forgot about our bodies.Germs are everwhere and i saw this BODY wash that is Antibacterial and ive never seen a body wash that also was antibacterial so i jumped on it, never  used Dial Before i was unsure of moisture properties since im dry skinned.I got very clean in the shower and it left no dry skin feeling.  I also had a bit of heat rash on chest and after first use it was better. the next shower it was gone.I will buy this over the Cashmere Body Wash by former brand from now on. If u have kids and use park or public restrooms it only makes sense to bathe in an antibacterial  body wash when u think about it Great product for a great price, nice scent too! When purchasing this I'd done a search for Dial Anti-Bacterial soap.  Guess I wasn't paying too much attention when I saw this product come up.  It's not an anti-bacterial but states on the label that it washes bacteria away.  Apparently this is no different from most other body washes.The scent is light and pleasant and it lathers well.  I'm sensitive to scents and I can't smell this on my arm after drying off.It says it's moisturizing and I don't doubt that, but I've yet to find a moisturizing body wash that helps by itself when your skin is already dry.  You'll still need to use an oil or lotion to re-hydrate your skin.  On the other hand, this won't dry out your skin. This smells so fresh! I often use it for bubble bath and it works great. I love this stuff! I don't use it every day (heard too many stories of people weakening their immune system by overdoing it on the anti-bacterial soaps) but I definitely use it at least once or twice a week for all over body cleanliness (that DOES last all day). Another great use I have found for this is once a week, I use this, just this, to wash my hair to help get rid of shampoo and conditioner build up. I always get compliments on how great my hair looks after using this, it is silky and shiny, and lightweight without heavy conditioners and shampo weighing it down! Simply the best fragrance for a body wash. This is one of only a few bodywashes that my skin can tolerate. I love the scent, the consistency and the shape of the bottle (which makes it easy to grab when wet or potentially slippery). My only wish is that it were a little less expensive as I can probably purchase 3 at a time cheaper by going to Target on a sale day for this item. But the convenience of having it shipped to me makes it worth it. Product is slightly different than picture. Especially the ingredients!  I bought it for general use. I don't need the ""antibacterial"". So I was ok with it not being as advertised. But the bottles I recieved do state ""washes away bacteria"" not ""antibacterial body wash"". If you specifically need it for that purpose then yes find the original product. Great deal, no complaints. Would reorder if I didn't go organic lol."
150,B001ET7A4K,"It’s is the only lotion iI really use. I have eczema and it helps a lot! Only issue for me was the smell… it had a weird smell to it. Dry, easily irritated skin Product good. Seller Not responsive to my inquiries about shipment problem. Best lotion for dry skin. Use sparingly and often. I have had a bad rash of dry patches all over my sides of body and legs. This was the BEST i used (not the most expensive) but it helped my dryness better than other products. I reccomend this Great for dry, sensitive skin. There is nothing to dislike about Cetaphil. I use the face day and evening plus the Hydrating eye-gel cream,  Moisturizing cream For body very dry, sensitive skin also. I felt it's better to use the cream after you get out of the shower (using the body/ face cleanser in the shower) or right before you go to bed so this way it gets a chance to work all night. But you can use all day if you wish😉 I ordered this for it's potential to be very moisturizing without feeling greasy or irritating and it's not greasy or irritating but it is NOT moisturizing enough for my skin."
151,B00028PDWK,"This product does not irritate my skin, It has just the right amount of scrub to use once a day. I’ve used this exfoliating product before and I will be using it again.  It only takes a pea size dollop for my entire face and I mix it with my creamy cleanser to form a nice lather. Gently massage your face then rinse and voila clean soft skin. Not a strong but please smell. I would highly recommend I am 72 yrs and have normal to sensitive skin.  For me, 3 times a week is perfect This product stopped my back acne and my face is cleaner than ever. Worth every penny. I've been using apricot scrubs, St. Ives, the grandma of them all, for 35 years and now I'm a convert.This brand left my skin butter soft and pores clear!!! It's a bit pricier, but worth it when used sparingly. I can't stop touching my face! All natural Soft and smooth! I have used this a brand for years going back to Whole Foods days. Now I don't live near one so this is perfect! I have been using this scrub once a week (sometimes twice) for nearly two years on my face and scalp to remove flaking skin cells. (This is my second tube.) Using it makes my face feel sparkling clean, and using it in conjunction with a tea tree oil shampoo keeps my scalp free of annoying dandruff. I use it in the shower.This scrub from Earth Science scrub does not use environmentally damaging plastic microbeads. As a result, an extraordinarily handsome, beaming face is gained without damage to marine life, and personal hygienic habits are become holy and are wholly politically correct. (Btw, a 4oz tube of this scrub often sells for less at Whole Foods.) Better than I thought it was going to be. Other apricot pit scrubs have been too harsh for my skin so I've stuck with Clinique 7 day scrub. I wanted to get away from the little beads in Clinique's product, however, because are bad for the environment & eco system. (Fish eat the beads then we eat the fish and therefore, the bead. Humans are not meant to eat plastic. Neither are fish for that matter.) Based on user reviews and my experience with other Earth Science products I decided to give it a try. Glad I did. It's creamy and the apricot particles are smaller/less harsh than Burt's Bees & St. Ives. If those 2 brands were too harsh for you and/or you like Clinique's scrub but want something natural, then give this a try."
152,B000EX5JO0,"This is now my go to skin products line! I will buy nothing but Derma E products for my sensitive skin from here on out!! I used this cream years ago and loved it.  I wanted to go back to it so I purchased it again.  This is the new formula.  My skin feels soft, however, it leaves residue that rolls off skin after a little while.  So I will use this jar and won't purchase again. Great for firming It smell weird, but it really works!  Nice, smooth, firm skin.  Very good! I initially liked this moisturizer, and the smell was fine, then I started noticing a really funky smell that got worse every time I used it. Other reviewers have said as much. I like it as a moisturizer, however the smell makes me wonder if I got a bad batch as other reviewers think the smell is just fine! My jar is really stinky and I am going to throw it out. Perhaps an ingredient went bad? I have a jar of Derma E Hydrating Night Cream that I have had for awhile and it works great, and smells lovely. I may try another Derma E day moisturizer because I have other a toner and and a serum by Derma E that I also really like. This product is a no-go for me. I like this, and Tatacha. This works just as well, and I can afford it. I buy this, over and over. This is a story of LOVE and HATE! I used this for a very long time up until about 9 months ago when I switched to a retinol cream. I decided to re-order to switch up my routine and the first time I put it on (on a washed and toned face) I remembered how much I loved this. It quickly absorbs into the skin, has minimal (if any) odor and leaves a firm and tight feel to the skin. LOVE!! I went about my morning routine (coffee, made the bed, checked the news) and then I began to (tried to) put on makeup. Ah, now I recall why I HATE this moisturizer! Well, hate may be an overstatement, but why I can not use this during the day. The box swears it is good under makeup. I am mystified as to how they can make this claim. I tried to spot conceal and everything just pilled off. I tried bb cream over it and that too was patchy and began to pill once I began to rub it in. I even tried mineral powder for redness around my nose and that pulled away from my skin as soon as I touched my face. So - LOVE for perfect-skin days and night use, but definitely DO NOT recommend for any sort of beneath-makeup use - HATE it for that reason. I love this brand. Every moisturizer is superb, but this one is my favorite. It feel so soothing on my face and also is great for layering, in drier seasons. Highly recommend!"
153,B0011DJICG,"I was looking for a body wash that does not have unhealthy ingredients. I tried the lavender scent and I love it. I get a great lather, a wonderful scent, and I feel “squeaky “ clean. I use it for taking baths--enjoy the scsent and it keeps the tub free of scum. I’ve bought it twice already. I really like it and like that they are better for your body and the environment! This is my favorite, general use body wash. It's gentle and doesn't irritate sensitive skin or wounds when cleaning painful areas.I love that the top ingredient is Aloe and there's no Phenoxyethanol. I'm not as big of a Phenoxyethanol hater as some, but I did feel like products with it triggered my Rosasea. I avoid skin products with it now.The scent isn't anything to write home about, which I actually like. If I'm going out or want a fancy aroma, I keep another product handy for those nights. I love this product, but this bottle that just arrived, I cannot open the cap so I can use it.The cap just keeps going around and around and the lid won’t pop up. I used to order this product for several years , but the last delivery was different. Package was not sealed as previously and smell was bad. Like plastic chemical smell. Unfortunately this was the last time I had this ordered. This is a good product,but some how the stopper came up and it leaked alot in the protector bag,Shame I lost some product and it was a good thing it was sealed in a plastic bag. I like this shower gel and so do my kids. I especially appreciate that there are no harsh ingredients. The price fluctuates quite a bit and I won’t but it if it’s too expensive. I took a star off because it’s been too expensive at times that I needed it."
154,B000HJT1CW,"My original review is below. I still stand by the statement that my face feels more dry after using it, but after a few days of using it, I have noticed a DRAMATIC difference in my skin. It is smoother, softer, and it is truly moisturizing. I guess my expectation was it would feel moisturized right away. However, it definitely does work, and I will most certainly buy more when I run out. Great product.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought this thinking it would be a cheaper solution than other items I would normally buy. However, when I first used the product, within minutes, it feels like my skin is drier than when I started. I sprayed on my face immediately after washing it.I read other reviews that said this is great for setting your makeup, but what I was looking for in a spray is something that will moisturize my face for a long time without having to go to great lengths to apply a cream or lotion.It does smell good and cools you off when you first use it, but it doesn't have a moisturizing effect that lasts. Once your skin dries, it is drier than when you started.I might try using a moisturizer first and then applying this product to see if I am happier with the results. If so, I will come back and change my rating. For now, it is just ""ok"". It is gentle on the skin. This is the only spray I use after I've had a facial while my skin is hypersensitive. I have tried using other sprays after facials and seriously regretted it..it stung and my face turned red, this is the only one I know of that doesnt. Another thing ,  it doesn't sting if it gets in the eyes. There are other sprays that are also good for the skin, but you get them in the eye and OUCHWhen you apply the product to your face, the first thing you notice is a cooling sensation. The second most obvious thing is the nice smell.  Even after the first application, there is a smoother feel to the skin. In the several weeks I have been using it, my skin has been better, less dry,  with a much nicer overall appearanceIt contains the antioxidant vitamin E, which protects the skin, glycerin moisturizes and a slight fragrance of rosewater refreshes and smells great. I think the rosewater is primarily added to give the product a nice scent, but rosewateris also reputedly good for cleansing and toning skinThe push down spray action is really good and sprays a wonderful mist onto your face (or wherever you spray it). The spray application system means that you only use a tiny amount per application, so a bottle will last you a pretty long time.Very Very Nice I started using the Body Shop's Vitamin E Face Mist about 2 years ago after I had decided to try using a powdered mineral face makeup that was becoming popular (ie. Bare Minerals).  I used the makeup very sparingly, but even so, found that my skin looked a bit powdery and dry.  I wondered if I found a facial mist to spray over the makeup, would my skin look more dewy rather than powdery/dry?  I ordered the Body Shop's Vitamin E Mist, and the results were amazing.  Now, I use a bit of the mineral face makeup, blush and then spray the facial mist as a final step. This gives my skin a soft and supple appearance and the powdery look is gone.  My makeup really does stay fresh all day.  I couldn't believe how much better the face mist made the mineral makeup look.  I would not be able to use mineral makeup if it were not for this mist.  I also use it in the middle of the day to ""freshen"" up my look.  The mist has a light rose petal scent.  This is one of those rare ""finds"" that I will enjoy for years to come.  Try it and I think you will love it, too! This is one of those products that is so hard to explain why it is sooo addictive.  I can't say I've noticed any changes in my skin since starting to use it, but I LOOOOOVE it.  I got it for days that my bare minerals makeup looked dry on my skin to use as a setting lotion and to look more dewy fresh.  It absolutely corrects that issue.  It moisturizes as well.  It smells like rosewater, which I don't really like, but have come to enjoy when I spritz my face.  It's incredibly refreshing and for anyone living in a hot climate, you will love using this.  Actually, it's also awesome for cold, windy, dry air too, so just buy it.  You wont be sorry.  It also is a very fine mist so it lasts a really long time.  don't let the price scare you. This is a big help on long flights. Recently took trip over seas and got super dried out on plane. Used this several times for relief. When my husband saw me spray my face he asked to use it too despite the rose scent.  We also used it a couple times while on long bus rides. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the rose scent is initially pretty strong.  To strong of a scent usually gives me a headache. The scent does die out pretty quickly, so luckily no headaches occurred. Good size for travel-TSA approved. I recently started regularly wearing makeup and was having a hard time finding a face powder (that wasn't chalky looking) to set my foundation. After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to try a face mist and based on previous reviews for this one, I thought that I would give it a try, given that the price was reasonable compared to more upscale brands. I have to say that I am extremely pleased with this product. It spritzed on very lightly and evenly. I love the light rose water scent and it sets my makeup perfectly. In fact, yesterday, I was in a hurry and forgot to spray my face. When I got home, I noticed that my face a bit shiny and realized that I missed my Vitamin E face mist. That will NOT happen again! And the benefits of Vitamin E for my skin is just gravy."
155,B00139TXUU,"I first purchased at my local health food store.  They were out of the product when I needed a refill.  I turned to Amazon and my wish was granted quickly. I like this product very much and plan to keep using it. I'm a youngish mid-sixties lady.Reviews I read before ordering suggested that it would change my life almost overnight. Well, I did see results almost right away, however, the real improvement has been cumulative.  I apply morning and night under Reviva  Alpha Lipoic, C Ester & DMAE Cream - wonderful stuff!  After 2-3 months my skin is tightening and even deep creases on my forehead are diminished.  Neck and throat are definately improved and much younger. My skin tone, color, and skin texture are definately younger too. Pores are reduced. My reaction is up to at least a 10 year difference depending on how much sleep I got the night before.I gave this product 4 stars but am very happy with the serum and the price. If it continues to improve my skin and tone, I'll revise the 4 stars to 5.I've been using this product for almost a year now.  It's still working great and I've seen an improvement in the deep creases in my forehead. They're still there but much less pronounced than even the last review. I upgraded to 5 stars. Can't do without it now. And I'm not being recompensed in any way for this review.I highly recommend. Edit: I used this product for a few months and unfortunately have to lower the rating. I was hopeful, but the product is too strong for me. It left my skin puckered on my forehead and cheeks, looking more dried out. I am sure this will work for people with less sensitive skin.Love this product! After two days, I wasn't impressed but was glad it didn't break me out like everything else. One week later, I love it! I am 47 y.o. and the creases in my forehead are deepening and the rest of my face was sagging everywhere. My skin was very tight after the first few days with no noticeable improvement and some mild tingling (went away after two days). I did not apply moisturizer afterwards because those break me out too. After one week...my face looks dewy, pores are minimized, and skin is becoming clear again. I have not had one breakout in the last week and my skin can finally heal. I use it every night while my face is still damp. I am still searching for the right moisturizer to put over it, but this works fine for me without it. When I do put it on during the day, my makeup glides on. It scores a 1 on the EWG scale with it's pure ingredients. Will buy this as long as they continue to make it, which I hope is forever. I wish Reviva made a gel moisturizer to go with it, no creams.Found a moisturizer that works great after this serum: Dr. Lin's Hydrating Gel I bought it because the price was good enough and wanted to use Hyaluronic acid serum. If you have dry skin, you probably need to put another cream after using it. Or, I always mixed with a dip of cream with the serum. So it doesn't dry out my skin. There are pros too. It doesn't have many chemical ingredients, so I felt my skin doesn't have any trouble.I know right away when the product is too chemical because my skin breaks out right away. The product case is not anything fancy, but when thinking about the price (10ish), it's good enough. Don't count on it alone too much. just use as a supplementary to your routine. You have to mix with other things. The consistent quality of Reviva products.  I use the hyaluronic acid to moisturize my face.. I’ve used this product for years n loved it but they just changed the formula and how it has an unpleasant smell and I won’t use it. Some of the natural ingredients seem to have been substituted with other ingredients. I found another brand to use now ( I used this one for  10 years) but I can’t take the chem smell. It has a new ingredient hydroxyethylcellulose so I want to return but it won’t let me. And it said eligible for refund or exchange within 30 days. Is there a place I can give 10 stars?  I will not promote any product that swears they are the best, then when you get it, its mediocre at best but this is NOT the case.  My mom said she loved it and she is a tough critic so I ordered it and the only way I can think to describe it well is to say that it gives my face the appearance of wearing foundation and I don’t wear any.  It has smoothed my skin and greatly reduced any imperfections.  People think I'm tan, but I'm not.  I just think what they are seeing is that all over smooth appearance that a tan could give you.  I LOVE the difference it’s made in my skin.  My only worry is that because it’s so good, what will happen if I ever stop using it (if product was no longer available would be the only reason).  I hope it’s making permanent changes to my skins appearance!!"
156,B00157S30Q,"I've been using this Advanced Retexturizing Peel for about three weeks now and I like it.  The directions tell you to use it every other day.  Follow the directions!  I tried to use it two days in a row and it irritated my face.  I like the fact that it helps my oily skin.  I am of Scandianavian decent and have very white, pink, red facial skin and don't know why it is so oily.  Whatever the reason, I think this product is helping somewhat.  I like the feel of the tightening skin and maybe it is making my pores smaller.  I don't have wrinkles yet so I can't address that issue.  I've also received another Avon product called Resurfacing something which another reviewer advised using together with this one.  I've only used it a couple of times and it is of a thicker consistency.  This one is a pre-moistened pad to use on clean, dry skin.  Boy, does it clean and makes my face feel great.  I even use it on my neck and chest.  I love the really clean and tight feel of my skin after using this wonderful product.5-15-13:  I like this product so much that I have already ordered another jar.  I don't want to run out.  I really like it!7-25-13:  I have discovered that once I finish using a pad all over my face, neck, and chest, I usually just leave it on top of the jar.  Well, I wondered just how much ""stuff"" was still in there.  After re-wetting it with a little witch hazel, I used it on my face again the following day and lo and behold, there is still plenty of ""stuff"" left in there.  I wouldn't suggest a third try but certainly consider a second use. Avon won't tell you if it even has 10% - I use this because it is cheap, but there are lots of other brands out there that are 20% even 40% concentration - so I'm sure they work better.  But these pads - I use Mon, Wed & Fri AM after washing my face.  Then wait a couple minutes before applying serum, lotion, etc.  And don't use this or any other glycolic acid product within at LEAST an hour (I'd do longer) of using Retin-a, retinol, etc. because they will cancel each other out and you won't get the benefit of either.  Use this in the AM and Retinol at night, and if you consistently use the two, you will see major anti aging affects.  You can't just use this one bottle, or every once in a while.  You have to use Every week, forever - I'd say from age 21 and on.  I've used it for 10+ years, I'm 34 and I look way younger.  On the Visia complexion analysis (free at Whole Foods or you can go to your dermatologist, I have VERY high scores meaning I don't have wrinkles.  Also this helped my husband's texture scores get WAY better.  Shrinks pores too!  Use a sunscreen though because this can make you more prone to burns This is a great product as I believe almost all of the Avon Anew products are. I have an illness that causes my skin to break out on occasion and it breaks out very badly when it does. I like to use this product AFTER the breakouts have healed! Do not use it during or if you have skin that is in the healing process! It will keep your skin from healing properly if you do. Once your skin is healed and you have red marks or slight scarring it is time to get this product out and put it to use! It is like having a mini skin clinic in a jar! It will very quickly help you to get your scarring and redness under control and get your complexion clear and even again. Even, to the point of erasing over time and continued use, small scars! It also works the same for frown lines and smile lines and age spots which is what it was intended for I am sure. It is a great product for both. Use it exactly like the instructions say. To use it any other way does not make it more effective, it just uses it up faster. I like that it tingles and I see a slight difference in the texture of my skin but nothing dramatic.  It may work wonders for someone who already has good skin and is looking to make it even better.  My skin is pretty bad so I am looking for something more aggressive to help get rid of the discoloration and smooth the texture.  I feel that maybe over time, (like 6-9 months) of continuous use this might get me the results I want but I am looking for more immediate results right now.  Everyone is different and this could work work well for someone else.  I will probably go back to using this as a part of my routine once I get my skin to the level I want it. Pads completely dried up. Not even usable. They don't accept refunds even if the product is defective. Scam.  No wonder they don't allow returns. Shame on Amazon for supporting such poor sellers. Heard great things about this peel and wanted to give it a try. I was hesitant to do something that was going to make my face extremely red and scabby. I was surprised to find that I felt nothing..literally nothing. It didn't make my face red, it didn't make my face peel, and it didn't even sting at all. So gentle was it that I had my doubts that it was going to do anything at all. I used these everyday for two weeks, despite that it said twice a week. At the end of the two weeks I will say that my forehead was a tad smoother so I guess it was doing something...just not much.Great peel for a nervous first timer. I just bought this product for the second time and so far it is the only skin care product I can say I truly love and will keep getting!  It contains glycolic acid which helps with acne prone skin as well as fine lines, tone, brightness, etc.  you can't use it every day so it lasts a long time.  There are 30 pads in the jar and so the first jar lasted me about 2-3 months.  At first it caused a mild stinging sensation but then my skin got used to it and it no longer stings when I apply it.  I now use it every other day and my skin looks great!  Even though I am 42 years old, I use to get small pimples around my chin.  I haven't had a pimple since I started using this.  It's a great exfoliater so the skin on my face is super soft now.  My make-up glides on easily and I could probably throw away my cover-up because I never need it anymore.  This product is definitely worth the money!"
157,B001CLXNZ0,"I love it I used this lotion in combination with the AHA body wash from Mario badescu and the Touch 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion. I was so close to making a dermatology appointment because I was so sick of the painful, nasty looking cysts all over my back, but within a few weeks of using this combination of products the cysts were gone. I use the body wash every day, and after washing I alternate between this lotion and the benzoyl peroxide one I mentioned before every other day. The glycolic acid is very exfoliating and brings existing acne to the surface so it can heal faster, and the benzoyl peroxide lotion  kills the bacteria causing the cysts and is also anti inflammatory. One thing to keep in mind is this product might tingle/burn slightly when you first put it on. I do not have sensitive skin, so for me that sensation was very brief upon initial application only and I had no issues. It may also cause the acne to seem worse at first since it does bring existing cysts to the surface faster, but give it a few weeks before deciding it doesn’t work. I’m so happy I discovered this product, I definitely recommend it for people suffering from hormonal acne. I love creamy serums like this. My skin is a peel veteran (Aha/Bha peels and cleansers,  acid serums with lactic acid, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, phytic acid, etc). I have acne prone skin and it’s sensitive to lots of stuff that helps with acne, so it’s a balance. This is super anti-inflammatory but also super potent. Do NOT use with any physical scrubs if you dont want it to sting; some acid serums are fine to do that with but this one is really strong which I love! I use it with a gentle cleanser from Sephora and the Thayers alcohol free toner, and follow with a rich moisturizer from Laneige and that has my skin so perfect. Like glass skin perfect. Always use sunscreen when you’re using this for suuuure. Even if you use it at night like I do. This is my 2nd time purchasing and my mom loves it too. I have struggled with mild random acne outbreaks on my face (usually after friday and saturday nights of drinking and etc.) My bigger problem though was acne on my back and shoulders! i have had this problem for some years, and usually it is only better in the summer months when i can get some sun. Anyway, benzoyl peroxide was never a big help, and the bleaching side effect was too much.The small improvement was not worth the hassle. Finally after years of frustrated google searches, i found AHA. I have been using it for about 2 weeks. Every day after a morning shower, i apply it to my back and shoulders, (so awesome to not have a bleaching effect to my clothes) and then go on with my day. I also shower at night, and then rinse it off and use a regular salicylic acid wash (off brand neutrogena wash). I sometimes put it on my face at night, but not every night. (my shoulders are a bigger problem). Alas!!! There is definitly a 90% improvement (nothing is perfect). I am super glad that i found this product. Now i almost have 1 less thing to worry about everyday as i go through life. Hopefully this is your miracle cure too!..By the way, i dont use any multiple step regiment. I only use the AHA and a mild wash. BP doesn't work for me, and i just cant stand multiple annoying stages of applying goop on my skin. This stuff is not super expensive and wont break the bank. Go for it! I love this stuff! I finished a accutane course almost a year ago. When I finished it I was left with uneven skin tones and a decent amount of Hyperpigmentaion. My dermatologist prescribed me Retin A and Hydroquinone cream which is supposed to be the good standard of Hyperpigmentaion removal. Not the case for me, I used that combo for 7 months and I didn't see a budge in the marks.After hearing such positive reviews on Acne.orgs AHA I figured I would try it even though I was skeptical since the ""gold standard"" didn't work I had doubts about this. It came quick, nice little bonus and it was larger than what I expected, another nice little bonus.So I used this for a couple of days mixed with a moisturizer like they recommend. The feeling of this going on your skin is like a little piece of heaven. It just feels nice, the gentle way you apply this just makes it feel like a treat every time I use it. It makes your skin so soft and brighter looking, it really does even out the tones of your face. Also it gets rid of that dullness your face has after recovering from acne. Now to get to the most important part, my marks. I see a 70% reduction in my Hyperpigmentaion and just over a months use!!! Amazing! I am thrilled and I now consider this a product that I never want to go without. Give this a try! I swear by this product. I use this along side with the Acne.org 2.5% benzoyl peroxide to treat my stubborn cystic acne. Im 16 years old and doesn't truly believe in some of the reviews in here since most of the products are being sent by the companies. But as for me, I paid this using my own money. (Actually its my Mom's. But i'll pay it back tho) Its been working great on my sensitive skin and 2 weeks of using it, I notice that my skin became smoother, and together with the use of benzoyl peroxide, my skin has never been better. But the SMOOTHNESS of my skin is unbelievable!!! And everytime I would apply moisturizer I've noticed that the moisturizer would actually penetrate on my skin and unlike before which it will just sit on top. The only reason why I gave it 4 awesome stars is because of the smell. It reminds me of mayonnaise which may sound weird but that's how I can explain it. But if you don't hate the smell of mayo , then you can totally get away with it."
158,B001E0R2YW,"I used to buy the $12 secret antiperspirant. It smelled great but if I had stress sweat, you'd know it because I'd smell horrid and have to keep my arms down. Well, this detoxifying wonder works wonders. I now can work outside all day, sweat like crazy and no stink whatsoever. I still stress sweat, but my underarms are SO clean, it's just sweat, no stink.Now I won't have those nasty underarm deodorant stains on my clothes. This opens a whole world of new possibilities of clothing types I refused to wear before because I hated my shirts rubbing up against my deodorant, getting cold & wet and making me feel terribly uncomfortable being wet with pasty stuff slipping around under my arms....just sooo gross-feeling!!!That's a thing of the past, now.I'm a huge fan of this soap, and this is the first charcoal soap I've ever bought. Crazy thing is, that delicate, sweet smell it has stays with my underarms all day. I wash my underarms and face with this about 3 times every shower (rub, scrub & rinse) just to be sure I got all the dirt (and oils that trap dirt in), but another interesting fact of why we stink is toxins being released from our bodies through the skin. I only stunk under my arms, but I imagine this would help anyone so overloaded with toxins that their bodies release the stinky toxins from anywhere on the skin covering their bodies (My husband's skin stunk really bad all over when he was addicted to Mountain Dew)...some good sweating exercise & eating healthy, though & he smells great again. I also struggle with acne and this helps.The drier parts of my body, however, get too dry using this. So I've made one bar of this soap last 2 months because I only use it under my arms & on my face/neck/chest.My 2 eldest sons (12 & 13) started stinking so I got them using this strictly for underarms also and they now don't wear deodorant, either, and yet smell good!It's so awesome I gave a bar to my 68yr old dad because he always stinks. I'm telling everyone about this who's interested in removing Alzheimer's-causing aluminum from their bodies by removing antiperspirant from their hygiene routine.Nothing natural ever worked for me, so I was just resigned to doing a heavy metal detox every couple years to deal with me using antiperspirant, because I refused to be stinky.This is HUGE blessing, I'm washing and Deoderizing in ONE STEP now, and saving money because of it!!!😄I only realized this worked because I was forced to go antiperspirant-free for a while because I nicked my under-arms while shaving and you can't wear antiperspirant on open wounds. I guess that was a blessing in disguise. 😉 I can only use this soap... I'm allergic to everything. This bar is the best out there for the money. It may seem expensive but it works. It's not greasy, and doesnt leave any smells. The ingredients seem to be of great quality. I've used it and my mother has used it for a long time. I stock up on it since there are times when it runs out. It leaves soap stains on your shower walls that are black but all soaps do that and these black stains come off just like all other soap stains. The 6 pack is the best deal and can be often found for $25 to $30. Just dont wait u till you run out to start looking for your refill. Please dont buy this for $8 a bar as there are lot of vendors that can hike the price. Highly Recommended. Very good product I was in B-town at a hippie healing shop and ask the clerk for something to help me smooth out and erase a scar.  He talked with me about Charcol Soap... he showed me a number of soaps and said just pick one.  I selected this one and I could not be more pleased.  I never felt this clean... it smells good, doesn't leave a bunch of black murk in your tub and it helps to heal broken skin. Plus you get two bars for this price, can't beat it. You read so much nowadays about how soap isn't ideal for body washing because some can leave a layer of film/scum but these charcoal bars seem to do no such thing - they are amazing!In the past year I've found myself wanting to keep my routine simple yet effective, and this purifying body bar by Giovanni makes it easy and keeps me happy. I run around outdoors with my dog a lot so that leads to sweat and dirt, which can consequently mean small breakouts in susceptible areas (upper back, chest, between breasts). Thankfully I don't have an issue having any amount of little bumps ANYWHERE simply by consistently using these bars with a lather pouf.To top it off it makes my skin feel perfectly fresh and CLEAN while keeping skin moisture very comfortably balanced. Giovanni has a charcoal body wash too that smells phenomenal; it's what lead me to these bars, difference is each bar seems to last forever! Major WIN. That's what we call it around here!  My teen had breakouts all over his body, he was horrified!  He washed daily and used all kinds of products that left him flaky and with zits.  This clears it right up,  after a month of use, without other products,  the outbreaks are greatly reduced, his skin is healthy looking and when he does get one or two zits they are not nearly as red and swollen or embarrassing.  Added bonus, he loves that he doesn't smell as much as he used to when he works out, and his feet no longer stink.  The whole family is thankful for that!  I was worried that it would stain my white fiberglass tub enclosure - but nope!  It does leave some unsightly dark drips if the dish drains but a little water washes it right away. No staining at all!  This stuff is awesome! I've purchased one other kind of charcoal soap before, it was really nice soap but it was deep black in color and left a mess wherever you used it. I'm not certain the brand but I got it at Mother's Market.This soap gives me the same deep clean feel without the mess/weepy soap staining and the soap smells really nice. (For the record, the bar is charcoal grey/light black color) It's also a really large bar for the cost! Very impressed."
159,B000GW55BG,"Love the product, but advertised as 4 oz. Item is only 3.4 oz. I have had this product for several months now, and there are some major pros. It is a large amount of moisturizer for a natural product, first of all, almost double what any other brand offers. Second, all the ingredients are simple and there aren't a ton of things in it to begin with. Third, it isn't oily at all. It may leave a slight film on your face if it isn't properly rubbed into the skin. It's thin and doesn't leave a white cast. It does have a very herbal scent, which is nice unless you're looking for unscented products.I haven't tested this in extremely sunny conditions but so far so good! I don't know if it actually fights acne as the packaging claims, but it's an all around very solid natural skincare product. I have been using this moisturizer for about a year or so now. It lasts if you use it sparingly, I used to use it everyday. But I began using it mainly on hot days and in the summer time because it makes your face a bit sticky from the spf. I enjoy the natural organic ingredients, I have not seen it benefit my skin when I get occasional acne, but I have yet to see a moisturizer that works well and is organic. I would like to look around for cheaper spf moisturizers for acne prone skin that are organic, but for now, I enjoy using this :) The texture is great and very light. Not sure how they get SPF 30 on this but if it works great.  Used to have a heavy mineral smell in the first bottle I got 2 years ago, but it's not present in this newest bottle. I'm assuming the formula has changed.  I wouldn't mind trying something slightly heavier with a higher SPF if they ever come out with it.  Bottle is a little large and cumbersome but it's a decent (really) ultralight daily moisturizer. I have been using this as a sunscreen for over a year. I am militant about sunscreen and have been for years. When I became educated on the effects some of the chemicals can have long-term on your skin and liver in many normal sunscreens, I immediately began a ""quest"" for the best natural sunscreen out there. I tried a couple different ones before landing with this one. I use it daily and was happy with the scent (so fresh!) and the feeling of it on my skin (it smooths on easily and doesn't make my skin feel oily, sticky, or make it turn a ghostly shade of white). But it wasn't until today that I realized that it really works! I knew that it was better than nothing, but I wasn't sure how long it lasted or how powerful it was because anytime I go to the beach or am in the sun for hours with direct exposure to the sun, I use something more heavy-duty. Today I found myself unexpectedly on an outing for 3 hours with direct sun exposure. I didn't have sunscreen on my arms and they got a pretty bad sunburn. I was sure my nose and cheeks would be burned after so long in the sun, but I'm happy to say they don't even have the slightest burn! If I wasn't a believer before, I certainly am now! Dear Kimberley: I have used your product for many years and it has been perfect daily on my oily combination acne prone skin. I absolutely loved this product and my family of eight all used it on a daily basis  - it's lightweight consistency, soft lemon smell, the ease with which it disappeared on my skin, the protection it offered was perfect....  However, this year when ordering several bottles from Amazon.com, because it became difficult to get in Canada, many things suddenly changed? Every bottle is THICK, sits as a white film on our faces and takes work to rub into the skin, the smell has gone and the wonderful vacuum pump bottles that easily dispensed the cream don't work???? At first I thought it was just one bad bottle but tried my others with the same problems.To pump the cream out I have to open the top and bang on my palm then it applies thickly and sits on my skin where it used to just simply disappear?  I now see other people are also experiencing this negative change? Please bring back the original formula as I am now searching for a different product as I can't use what used to be my most favourite product. I sincerely hope this product returns to what I would have considered a 5 star moisturizer and SPF 30 cream. Thank you. I LOVE this product!!! It goes on really smooth, NOT cakey like some facial SPF products do. Most of all it's natural and does not have all those typical carcinogenic chemicals that most SPF products do. I spend a lot of time researching products and try to find the cleanest line as well as one that is practical--meaning it isn't like mud to put on your face and then makes you look like a ghost after applying it. You'd think that all SPF products would be healthy because they are suppose to prevent skin cancer but yet the majority of them are loaded with the very things that can make us sick, have allergic reactions to, and have those terrible life threatening chemicals in them. Did you know that 60% of creams/lotions absorb in our body-blood stream?  Well Kimberly Sayer Ultra Light Facial Moisturizer is one of the more healthier products for our skin. It has a nice light citrus smell and feels good on the skin. If you want a product that is SPF chemically healthy for you and goes on smooth like silk, then Kimberly Sayer is the one you DEFINITELY want to buy!!! Thank you for making this AMAZING product!!!"
160,B000GDC4J6,"I love how this moisturizer makes my skin on my face and neck feel every morning- hydrated, smooth and soft. I live in a dry climate and have dealt with dry skin my whole life. I notice a huge difference when I use this moisturizer regularly. This stuff is the real deal. Great product! This full price murad product did not have murad seal on the box. No way to know if it is authentic. Very disappointedI have used this product for many years.  The product is very good. It says it comes from Murad. Why no seal on the box that company says signifies it is authentic? I got the Resurgence cleansing product, the Resurgence day cream and this product. It DOES actually fulfill my expectations. Not greasy and lasts and lasts. Skin feels better than a baby's and it DOES help ease wrinkles. I have bought well over 1.5 thousand dollars worth of creams and serums in the last 6 mo. of this year and they dont do what this system does. This system works THE BEST.  I am really looking good. Most lines have disappeard. Have a line from mough to chin which is about %75 gone. Even botox didnt help it that much. And there is a 1 between my eyebrows which is also disappearing. I can't  laud the Resurgence line enough. Also use the PaloVia laser and NuFace microcurrent. Considering I'll be 65 next month and I have light, dryish skin; I am looking really good. Texture and color are better as well. The Resurgence isnt cheap, but Amazon tends to have the best selection of prices. But I would rather pay for products which work than pay for those which dont. I bought this because I couldn't find Essential-C night moisture, which was the best for me. I have been using it for years and it was worth the money 💰. My face used to be glory and beautiful when I woke up in the morning, I looked younger. But now I lost all that. Why does Murad company take it away? PLEASE BRING BACK ESSENTIAL-C NIGHT MOISTURE. IT WAS THE BEST PRODUCT EVER. This has been the first skin care product that really makes a difference to my skin.  My hair stylist even told me that my skin looked great! After one month, I can definitely see an improvement in the smoothness and note a softer texture. It feels creamy, yet light on my skin, with no irritation. I am so happy to finally find something that gently smooths and revitalizes my skin. I am in my early 50s, and have taken great care of myself and protected my skin. Unfortunately, hormonal changes and chemo have aged me. Nightly application has really helped. I can highly recommend!-- Please note, I had a tube, years ago, that had must have been past its expiration date, because the oil had separated...it really did not help at all.  I decided to try again and this fresh creamy batch is really working -- Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream is fantastic! The skin care professional I seerecommended it and I bought it through her spa the first time, but found it here on Amazonfor $25 less! It is one of those products that I now would prefer not to live without. Asa much younger person I spent a LOT of time in the sun, tanning my skin, and my face is nowpaying the price of that action.This cream really re-hydrates my skin and gives it a luster it hasn't had for years. I feelgreat and look better (at least to myself, and isn't that what it's all about anyway?).I highly recommend this product. It was delivered rapidly. The only reason I can't give itfive stars is I think the price is too high...surely it can't cost this much too make. I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine. Well, at 56 I just felt my skin wasn't looking great and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money). My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great. That was when I decided to invest in the entire Resurgence line of products. I started with the wash to day/night treatments, the mask etc. It was a costly order but the results are worth it! It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing. Even my husband noticed the difference. Don't waste money trying to 'save' money. I will never look for any other skin care products because I don't have to, I finally found what was right there for years! While hospitalized for COVID19, I did not use murad.  My skin became like sandpaper.  I couldn't wait to restart my regime.  Now my skin is again soft and supple thanks to Murad."
161,B00023KDAW,"Smells so good, bubbles easy Has an amazing smell if u want to indulge yourself make u feel beautiful,,, but for the price it should last even after stepping out the shower… kinda disappointed 🙁 I love this spray. I'm going to look for another amazing grace fragrance . Highly recommend I was introduced to this scent years ago from  a good friend, and loved it.  I have been buying all the product ever since, it is the only scent I use, and I get compliment all the time. My wife uses it After reading other reviews, I realized this is a spritz. That’s exactly what I was looking for with work and every day use. Scent is beautiful once it settles into your skin. No heavy parfum smell. Slight rubbing alcohol smell if you spray it in the air. But it’s meant to be sprayed directly on you skin, not sprayed and walked through like parfume! I love everything about it!  Dry off after a shower/bath and spray all over. Lovely. Great deals love this scent My wife had puchased it before and currently could not find it anywhere and she loved it so much. I searched on Amazon and found it much cheaper so I got it for her for Christmas, I scored a lot of brownie points."
162,B0013L3XMM,"I have been using this for 6 months now and I’m on my second tub. I have slight rosacea on the right side of my face. A dermatologist recommended I try this.  While it hasn’t cured my redness, my redness also hasn’t gotten any worse. I do think it’s slightly better. I have used this every single night for 6 months now. It never bothered my face or made me break out or itching or anything. I will continue to use this. I love this lotion! I have rosacea, acne, dry & oily skin, and also sensitive to lotions. Before trying this, I was using a hypoallergenic ""Simple"" lotion, but it was turning my face bright red and burning when I put it on. I bought this Eucerin lotion and it solved everything immediately. My face is so happy when I put it on, the smell is clean and nice (doesn't smell like much), and very moisturizing. I think my rosacea has decreased as well with continued use. I would highly recommend! June 26, 2010*****BINGO!  Finally!  This product is called Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Night Creme (even though there is no product name on my review any longer - don't ask me why because I don't know).  This is the product I was talking about when I originally wrote the review.  I can't get it from any of the stores here in my hometown, but now I can order it on Amazon.  A word about that ordering:  I placed the order on June 17 and received the product in the mail on June 25 from American Wholesaler.  The product was in an 11""x8"" bubble mailer envelope and had been squished and squashed so much during it's travels through the postal system that it had come completely out of it's totally flattened box but was still inside the envelope.  It was a minor miracle that the jar had not broken.  The shipping cost from this company was quite low but I can't help but wonder how often this jar gets smashed while it is traveling through the mail in an envelope this big.June 15, 2010******Edited for clearer information:  I absolutely loved the Night Creme but have not been able to find it in any store in my area for a while now.  Yesterday I bought Eucerin Original Moisturizing Creme.  IT IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!  What I have now is very thick and sticky.  I had to stir it with my finger to get it a little softer in the jar.  When I put it on my face there is a slight greasy feeling remaining  one hour later, even though it is fully absorbed into my skin.  I will use this ONLY at night, but it definitely isn't the same fabulous silky product which I originally wrote this review for.  I just don't want you to buy something I've recommended when I now know something has changed.  Why do they do that????  Makes me mad!  At least one thing hasn't changed, a tiny bit still goes a long way.  I notice the product name has been taken off my review, don't understand why that is.  I am going to place an order with Amazon for the product this review appears under to see if THIS is the Night Creme I originally bought.  I'll come back after I receive the product for an update.  Good Grief!  This thing is turning into a novel to rival ""Gone With the Wind"".I have mild to moderate rosacea.  I began two weeks ago to use three Eucerin Redness Relief products (Soothing Cleanser, Soothing Moisture Lotion and Soothing Nigh Creme) to try and reduce the redness of my facial skin.  I am seeing a marked difference already.I use the cleanser twice a day, the lotion in the morning and the creme at bedtime.  I have not been able to find out what the difference is between the lotion and the night creme but I decided to try all three products to see what result they would produce.  At some later time I may decide to use the lotion twice a day and dispense with the night creme altogether but right now, I really like the product.  Do not be put off by the fact that you only get 1.7 ounces in this jar.  Believe me, just the tiniest dab on the tip of my finger is sufficient to cover my entire face.  At this rate, this jar will last for a very long time and will be a true bargain.The makers of Eucerin Redness Relief encourage users to give the products four weeks to make a difference in their skin color.  As I have already stated, I am seeing a marked result after only two weeks.  I will continue using all three products and will update this review after the full four weeks.  I could only find the cleanser at one store and the lotion at another and could not find the night creme at all.  I opted to order all three products from Amazon in order to begin this trial.  The order was shipped very quickly and the shipping charges were almost completely offset by what my state sales tax would have been.I hope this information has been of help to you and that you will have success with these products if you decide to try them.*****April 26, 2008****I'm back with an update.  I absolutely love this product.  I have never been one to use cosmetics of any sort (just not interested) and so I don't know an awful lot about them.  This night cream is so light, no fragrance, and no greasy oily feeling whatsoever.  I will continue to use this even if I don't continue on with the other two Eucerin Redness Relief products I'm currently trying.  And still, a TINY bit goes a long, long way.  I may have to ask my store to order it in for me when I run out because this is the one product I cannot find on any drugstore shelf in town.*****August 12, 2009*****I'm still absolutely sold on this product.  I can order it from Amazon and have it delivered directly to my door so that's how I do it now.  Still light, non-greasy and fragrance free.  REALLY good!  I even use it for daytime and the ""night creme"" police haven't gotten me yet. I have had a rash on my face for a couple weeks now and thought this would help but it just mad my face burn more …Costumer service  was greatRefunded my money immediately .Think it’s a great product just didn’t work for me . tones down redness I’ve been using this for years, both day and night. It’s lightweight and calming to my skin. Very refreshing.  I prefer it over some of the pricier brands I’ve purchased over the years. He is very sensitive about his face. This helped him a lot to hydrate. Important to know that this will do little forredness.  Try another Eucerin product that istargeted specifically for this if need be. Thisproduct is a great moisturizer though. Very soothing."
163,B00005REAQ,"Product is great, I have used it before.  Packaging was awful.  The bottle was packaged in shrink wrap that was so tight that it  caused the pump on the bottle to be pushed down in a way that caused the soap to leak out of the bottle.  So a good portion of the product was missing.  Fortunately the bag was sealed enough that none of the soap leaked into the shipping box. A very smooth lotion which is very easily absorbed into the skin. Added bonus a very pleasing delicate scent and great sun protection to boot. I use albas face wash and was commited to another brand for moisturizing. They out of stock so i jumped ship and bought albas brand. I figured it would work and it does, but whats with the packaging? The lid is hard to pull off and the dispenser isn’t work so i have to remove the lid and dispense then squeeze the tube. Is this normal?? This left my face soft and clean.  The smell is light and smells clean but once washed off, it  doesn’t linger.  This foams really well.  Super happy with this product!! I am a man and I suffer from cystic acne. For the last couple months, I have been on an antibiotic regimine for this which has helped tremendously but also causes me to have very dry skin and be susceptible to sun burn. So I decied to get some moisturizer with SPF. I tried a couple other brands, most were either too thick or had an awful smell(chemically). This smells really fresh with little hints of ocean smell. It also makes my skin immediately feel cool and refresshed. It IS to be used SPARINGLY though. If you add too much, it will feel thick and slimy. Usually running a rag over my face lightly fixes that, but I am now more careful not to overapply it. Start with just a little dot and spread it between your fingers and cover your entire face in circular motions.For me it has helped balance the complexion of my face more, but I will say that it's not some miracle cream. I don't really care about it, but I have circles under my eyes which using this daily for two months has not helped--maybe it will in the future though. Never had a sun-burn while wearing it either. Good stuff! I've used the previous version of this moisturizer for a while and have liked it. The first time I bought this new kind, the pump didn't come with all of its parts and nothing comes out when I pump, so it's barely usable. Disappointing. I have previously purchased the mask on the same line and already knew I liked the smell and the results on my skin. My skin is pretty clear as is, but I wanted to move away from using my body soap (typically black soap or castile) on my face, so I looked around at other natural options and eventually landed on this. I've only used it for just under a week, but I felt a difference almost immediately, with  my skin feeling softer and more hydrated, and more even. A little goes a long way, so it's unclear right now just how long this small bottle will last, perhaps 2 to 4 months? The pump works well, too.Update June 24, 2016Okay! So I still enjoy the smell of this product and feel that it is pretty creamy, but I actually stopped using it on my face a couple months ago. It just seemed that my pores were getting clogged, which is unusual for me given that I tend to have naturally clear, dry skin. I guess I do better with gentle, clarifying cleansers, so I've been back to my black, castile soap. I still the Even Advanced as a shave cream because it feels so rich, and I may return to occasional use when winter rolls around again... i have crazy crazy sensitive skin, and after using this product for a month i went ahead and ordered a second bottle. i used cetaphil for years but never saw an improvement in my skin, but the difference in the months i've used this product is super clear. my skin just feels so clean and fresh after using it, especially compared to cetaphil. bonus points because its one of the few gentle facewashes that actually smells nice. because of this product i'm a huge alba  botanica fan :)"
164,B0015C0RIC,"There is nothing like glycerine to moisturize your skin. I use it straight out of the bottle for my nails and cuticles and I add more to my face and body lotions. I have extremely dry skin and this solved my itching and flaking problem! Large bottle and great for diy beauty projects. No scent, but helps emulsify and add moisture to lotions, baby wipes, body sprays etc. Without using it in a snow globe, it is amazing how quickly the glitter leaves the water.Just a little dab in the snow globe and presto change o the glitter now is in slow motion and the blizzard of glitter take’s it’s sweet time leaving the water!I wish it had the same affects in a swimming pool!  I’d have to by it by the gallon to see the slow motion affects! I add it to my serum to turn it into a moisturizer, and to liquid foundation to make it adhere to skin much better and add a dewy look. I have super oilly skin and the foundation usually rubs off midday. but ever since I started adding this glycerine to my skin care especially foundation, my skin is not oily anymore. Maybe because now my skin is always moist enough. And the most pleasant thing I like is that now the foundation looks like natural dewy skin and not cakey anymore. Glycerine is a humectant which means it draws moisture into the skin.  Therefore, applying glycerine before other products like emollients and occlusives will make the other products more effective.  Most products that contain glycerine only have a small amount but there are serums with decent glycerine percentages. If you don’t want to spend a ton on them, try supplementing with pure glycerine.  If you have sensitive skin then maybe dilute it a little with water.Glides on easiest with wet skin or mixed in lotions or Aloe Vera gel.For Dolphin skin:Apply a high glycerine serum or pure glycerine.Follow with an emollient like a rich body butter.Add body oil.Seal it up with Vaseline.Most of the time, I just do glycerine and a nice butter or lotion.  Then add the other steps here and there when I have the time or energy.I use it on my face, too, but only every so often. It can feel a bit sticky if using it pure and can make your skin want to stick to even a silk pillowcase. So just beware.Sometimes, I lather my face and body with glycerine and grape seed oil before a shower.  Then my skin is nice and hydrated but not sticky after I get out and I lose less moisture with hot water.I also add it to my shampoo and conditioner, body wash, and face wash directly at times. I use this product to make my own foaming soap, works great. I add just a drop or 2 to my moisturizer or to just a moist face. My skin reacts well to this in many ways. Lines soften and my skin feels good. It works well for me , it doesn't break the bank,  And...IT'S NOT LOADED WITH CHEMICALS!!! I use this to make natural dryer sheets. Clothes come out extra soft. I have sensitive skin and have no problems."
165,B000JVA80C,"It dries fast and it’s super moisturizing; it does it’s job! But it has a strong scent rhat didn’t agree with my nausea My wife only used it once so far, but I give 5 starts for smelling exactly like Froot Loops! I won't eat it, but it smells delicious! I just delivered a month ago and even though I'm sleep deprived with little time to do anything other than taking care of baby, I feel obligated to write this review as this really worked for me.  My skin is stretch mark prone even though I have always been of average weight, and I have a lot of old stretch marks on my hips and behind my knees from my growth spurt during adolescence.  So I was really concerned about pregnancy related stretch marks (I put on 30 pounds during my pregnancy) and I'm so pleased to report that this product really worked for me, but I wanted to tell you specifically how I used it.I was really dedicated to moisturizing my belly with this product twice a day from like month 3 of my pregnancy, before I even started getting bigger.  I will admit that the smell was a little strong for me with my super pregnancy sense of smell at that time, so I actually mixed the lotion for a couple of months with a little lavender essential oil that I could tolerate the smell of a little better.  I also added some drops of pure vitamin E oil, and some coconut oil, aloe vera juice and glycerin that I had on hand to the product to reduce the smell but mostly to make it even more moisturizing for my growing belly.  I think that the addition of these natural moisturizing items probably helped too but I'm not sure and I do think that the product is very moisturizing on its own and is not greasy at all.Ultimately though I think that the key to preventing stretch marks for me was consistency in moisturizing my belly twice a day (morning/midday and then at bed time) diligently from very early on in my pregnancy and to the day I delivered.  I believe that you can stay stretch mark free even with a giant belly with consistent moisturizing using a really good lotion like this. I liked this oil--it made my stretching skin less irritated, didn't smell half-bad, and was fairly affordable. I've gone through bottles of this. I do not think it's 5 star worthy, and deducted another star from reading the description of the product claiming to ""prevent stretch marks"". I caution anyone to be wary of anything that says it ""prevents"" stretch marks, as it's not a verifiable claim and there are many factors that play into your skin's elasticity (genes, smoking, alcohol use, weight gain, hydration).  I'm a medical physician who cares for obstetric patients, and am admittedly just as prone to vanity as any other mother out there.  It's difficult watching your body change in ways you had no idea it could. My mother carried four children, including a twin pregnancy, without so much as a single stretch mark,though she was 29 with the last (twin) pregnancy.  I thought I'd be safe, as genetics appear to play a role on stretch marks and I have a great family history.  Since week 7, I've been religiously applying this stuff twice daily.  I'm over the age of 30, and my skin isn't what it used to be, I realize this.  I'm also a non-smoker, rare alcohol use prior to pregnancy, and have gained less than 30 lbs of weight at 38+ weeks pregnancy.  Given my BMI prior to pregnancy, this is right on track.  Around week 24, I noticed some red markings on my sides, which are now very purple and very long stretch marks--my left side worse than my right.  Since week 35, I noticed the purple stretch marks on the underside of my stomach.  Then, there were only a few, but now at 39 weeks, they have become quite numerous and span the entire underside of my abdomen and are creeping upward. At first, I found this extremely upsetting (I'll redirect you back to the above).  Then I found it upsetting that I was upset about it--I know what pregnancy does to a woman's body, so I should not have been surprised! Nor should I have been so silly to think I could ""prevent"" something that is going to happen on it's own!  Can I say that my stretch marks would have been worse had I not used this? No. Could they have been exactly the same as they are now?  Yes, but we'll never know.  And if you feel that anything prevents stretch marks, please direct me to the study/evidence so I can decide if it's a legitimate claim.I would recommend this simply for my vegan or vegetarian patients who prefer cruelty-free, and am a fan of ""less is more"" in my beauty products when I use them.  I would also recommend this for its moisturizing qualities, though it can stain your clothes/bedding.  I would NOT recommend this--or anything else (take that, Dr. Oz)--as a ""prevention"" for stretch marks (again, see above). Instead, I would say that stretch marks happen and we should accept that. There are women out there who would kill for stretch marks just to have carried a child.  I think there's too much pressure on women (in our culture, especially) to not have a blemish after delivery and return to a stick-thin figure. It's not a realistic expectation for ANY woman, and even I feel those same pressures.  I've realized that not matter how many stretch marks I get, or how much my body changes, I'll be damned if this keeps me from a bikini ever again. And when I have baby #2 or #3, I'll be ready for them.  I'm growing a person in me, and I'm proud of that. I have used this on my incredibly itchy big belly since week 30.  I did not get one stretch mark until the 37th week when my baby's head dropped and the skin around under my belly button was under extreme tension.  I felt that area of my skin could tear as my baby's head put so much pressure there.I use this every night liberally after I shower, right before I go to bed.  I suppose this is good for those instances on skin where there isn't extreme, sudden stretching as under my belly when my baby dropped.  Everywhere else on my belly is clean as a whistle.  Even my nurse commented how wonderful my belly looks.  I will continue applying it (especially to the area under belly with lots of stretch marks) once a day at night after my shower before sleeping.Else, this is a very mild, faint, pleasant smelling natural oil that gets a good portion absorbed into the skin.  I wouldn't put it on right before going out in public, as I think the oil would get on clothes and collect dirt.  But have great results just using it before bed and letting it slowly absorb while I fall asleep.  The ingredients seem pleasant.  Like these nice all natural ingredients get absorbed through your skin into your body...which can only benefit my baby.I also had an oil splatter burn on my arm a few weeks ago... after a week since I got burned  after the burned areas developed into scabs, I started rubbing this oil liberally on the burned areas.  It had an almost immediate effect of rapidly diminishing the pinkish skin and helping it to blend with my old skin.  I continue to put it on the burned areas, for the past 2 to 3 weeks with such fantastic results.  Some of the burned spots just are almost invisible now.  (...better than that $150 Strickvia or whatever you call it for removing scars!!)p.s. I'll let you know in a month or two if my under belly stretch marks dissappear after giving birth.  Fingers crossed!"
166,B001E96NYS,"Product smells great  worked on removing my make up  will buy again I've been using these makeup remover wipes for a couple years now, after having experimented with different brands of wipes and liquids. I primarily use black waterproof liquid eyeliner, black waterproof mascara, and various shades of brown pencils to fill in my brows. Those are used daily, while I use lip products and eyeshadows very occasionally.These wipes have been very successful in removing the entirety of my makeup each night. Yes, I do still feel the need to wash my face after using them, but I would wash my face before bed anyway. And compared to some of the (even supposedly oil-free) makeup removers I have used in the past, the trace that these leave is miniscule.I've also had problems in the past with makeup remover doing funny things to my skin... either drying it out or making me break out pretty badly. So far I haven't had any of these issues with this product.On top of all that, as far as these products go, this definitely seems to be on the cheaper end of the spectrum, so that's bonus points right there.What could be bad? A product that works well and does what it says it will, and doesn't make you shell out extra cash either. Wonderful! I love the package these wipes come in. I'm a huge supporter for the LGBT community. My best friend is gay, and it's a huge honor to support them and their right we as straight people have. The make up wipes themselves are awesome! I don't use anything else. They work great and don't cause my skin to break out! Wipes were the cheapist for makeup so I was down to get them. When they got here I was very exited to use them but when I was using them, they were barley wiping off any makeup so I gave this a 3 star just because they really tried to make a good product but I don't think it worked to well on makeup. Was not happy with the pride package. I love the makeup remover but, will have to decline any more purchases. These are OK in my opinion.  I got the original which comes with a box and this replacement package.  What I've come to find out, is that they do a great job at removing makeup and the pouch here is resealable (which I use inside the plastic box they come in).  The frustrating thing is that they occassionally dry out which is not a bad thing necessarily.  I simply grab one, wet it in the sink and go to work on removing makeup.  I would love it if they made this such that one side is a little more textured than the other - kinda exfoliating and that kind of thing instead of being smooth on both sides.  Reason for this is to do a thorough clean on the face.  Several months ago I had some cleansing towlettes that did just that - and silly me, I cant for the life of me remember the brand or where I got them. This item never seems to fail. Gentle on my face and takes makeup right off. Have repurchased 3 times now. Was hesitant after reading some reviews about not good for sensitive skin or breakout prone skin but I have both and these are great! Haven’t caused any acne or dryness and makes my face feel moisturizer and soft!"
167,B000VSZDVW,"The pump is perfect, as it doest leak, and despenses easily pumped. I like what it does to my skin it is my night time moisturizer. I got this product to use it for gua sha, to have something slippery on my face for the tools to go over smoothly.However, the packaging was a big turn off. When I took it out of the box, the entire bottle was super sticky and leaking.This is a bit of a larger bottle with a regular opening, which makes it really difficult to get just a little bit of oil out. It does need some sort of spout type, otherwise you just get it all over every time you want a little bit of it. Huge waste.I used it for my scalp and hair just ones so far and wrapped it for two hours to let it sit in before a shower. and I did not see a difference in terms of moisturizing.It doesn’t smell good, but I don’t care about the smell as long as the product works. I don’t need a bunch of scents in a product.I wouldn’t get this again just for the way it’s packaged. An oil needs to be packaged adequately so it doesn’t arrive leaking and it also needs to be able to be portioned without a mess. Very nice. Thank You I make my own skin care products due to health issues, and this carrot seed oil is a must-have in an facial serum/cream formula.Carrot seed oil in general is a great anti-ageing agent as it's known to contain a natural UVB blocker (umbelliferone, also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin) that protects the skin from UVB and helps balance skin tone, reducing hyperpigmentation. Thanks to its high oleic acid content, it's also highly beneficial for dry and/or ageing skin.This particular brand is very good, not to mention economical. The oil is always very fresh (not rancid or oxydated) and potent. A little goes a long way.I would not recommend using it alone, as it can me mildly irritating and block pores (comedogenic rating is 3–4). But it's great mixed with any other oil with a low comedogenic rating (e.g. argan oil, hemp seed oil, safflower oil). I went looking for argon oil after my hairdresser suggested I rub some on my chronically dry and brittle ends. I don't use any hair products and don't abuse it with heat damage, but my hair was always really dry and damaged. I've been using Shea Terra Organics Argan Oil for about a week now and my hair has completely changed. My curls are more defined and bouncy and my hair is super soft. I apply it on my damp ends after I've showered. Less is more, I only use one pump of oil for whatever I'm going to use it for: hair or skin. The bottle says that you can use it as a deep conditioning treatment by massaging the oil into your scalp and then shampooing as usual. I'm excited to try this as my ultimate goal is to grow my hair out long and healthy. This is a 2 oz bottle, but I imagine this lasting me a while since I use so little. I've read that exposure to oxygen lessens the shelf life of argan oil (which is about a year), so the pump on the bottle is an added bonus (no need to unscrew the top). It's also a great post facial-cleanse moisturizer! Again I only use one pump, rub it between my hands and then apply to my face. It absorbs super quickly and my skin is left feeling very soft and hydrated. I've read that it evens out skin tone and fades acne scars? It's too soon to tell if that's true, but it has now replaced my facial moisturizer! I researched argan oil and there are several brands out there that vary wildly in price. Now that depends on which branding mogul is backing the brand and the marketing costs, but really, when it comes down to it, you should be looking for four things: (1) 100% pure argan oil (there should be no other ingredients), (2) it should be cold-pressed, (3) it should have a mild nutty fragrance and (4) it should be stored in a dark glass bottle. As for the smell, it fades quickly once applied. Mine smelled mildly nutty like plain popcorn. I'm giving this brand 4 stars because it doesn't seem to have an expiration date on it, something that would be nice to have considering it only keeps for about a year. Product comes in a PLASTIC bottle, not sure if anyone cares or not or should butConsidering a return, im sure everyone would appreciate more transparencySpeaking of such a thing, at least the bottle is brown and colored to prevent degradation-Im sure the product is really good too, just not sure I can try it based on the packaging, consuming less plastics should be on everyones to-do(n't) list Price. After trying and loving a sample of Acure's argan oil, I went looking for a larger bottle and debated for an embarrassingly long time over which brand to order. I really like Acure, but the bottle is frosted glass and I prefer dark amber bottles to protect against light damage. I ended up with Shea Terra because it had overall positive reviews, is from a trust-worthy company, comes in a dark bottle, and at less than $20 for 2 oz on Amazon, the price is an insane steal.I just received my bottle, so I've only used it once and can't attest to long-term results, but my first impression is mostly positive. The oil is slightly thinner and clearer than Acure's, and to be honest I prefer the more plush, viscous texture of Acure's oil, but they do seem to sink into skin and moisturize the same. Both have a slightly odd smell, which is normal and desired for argan oil - to me it smells a little rubbery. Shea Terra's scent is slightly milder and less noticeable, if that sort of thing bothers you.My main complaint, and the reason for the 4 star review, is the packaging. I hate the pump. It's very difficult to control how much oil comes out, and pretty impossible to dispense a very small amount like you could with a dropper cap. I thought maybe I could just switch the pump cap out for a dropper, but nope, the cap doesn't come off. That's also problematic because once you get down to the bottom of the bottle, there's going to be quite a bit of oil left inside that the pump can't get to.So overall I'm happy with my purchase, but I think when I finish this bottle I'll probably just purchase the Acure oil (which I do like just a bit better) or try to find something else that comes with a dropper cap."
168,B000OFB5QO,"Works well recommend Works okay for price and quality I order this for my vacation, I used it every single day on my legs and used a different product in the behind of my 12 day vacation to compare and I loved this. The smell isnt the greatest but here I am months later and still have a beautiful brown tan. I put a layer of 30 SPF on first let that dry than used this after reading some reviews but since I have naturally tan skin I was okay with the spf it was just a precaution. Will be buying more before next summer that's for sure! There is so much internet hype over this cream so naturally I had to try it out since we got a pool this summer and I knew I'd be in the sun often. I can't really say Im super impressed...My first impression was the horrid smell. Honestly I wish I had browsed more reviews. I expected for this to have some sort of coconut or tropical scent but instead its like coffee, which honestly just makes me cringe. I have been washing my hands right after so I have no idea if this stains them, but my hands are quite orange/brown after applying so Im not sure I'd bring this to the beach with me. It does moisturize quite well and paired with my copper tone 15spf tanning aerosol, I am really happy with my color.To combat the smell I've been mixing it with a little bit of coconut scented oil, but that scent really just gets me and not in a good way.Overall I'll continue using since it was more than I would usually spend on a lotion that has zero spf in it, but I'm not sure I'll re-order for next summer I actually really like this. I know some reviews said that it smells like coffee, but it wasn't a bad smell to be honest. I would recommend putting this on with gloves. So last year I got supper sunburned because I went to Fort Lauderdale FL right out of winter/spring and i was super pale and went to the beach and FRIED my poor legs and shoulders. All because I couldn’t get a good bace tan before going…. Anyways BACK TO THE POINT..I’m trying to get a good bace tan before summer so I can enjoy the summer and not worry about burning as bad and look good ofc. It has been in the 70’s and sunny the last 2 days straight and I just got it today! Package was fine no spilling or anything.. yes, it’s super oily 😬. And it smells but I can live with it. It smells nothing like coffee.. I work at Starbucks I know what coffee smells like.. not this. If you get in the water for awhile I would recommend putting more on along with sunscreen because it will wash off. I have been laying out for about an hour 1/2 and I can’t tell a difference obviously but I’m hopeful.WEAR SUNSCREEN!!this product won’t keep you from burning! It’s a tanning oil. I put a baby 50 on and I’m fine. Also wear dark clothes/swimsuits because it will definitely transfer. I like how tan I got using this product as I have tried a lot of other products that didn't work. Just be careful when applying this product you aren't near furniture, desk, etc. The product will leave a greesy film on those products but it is easy to wipe off those products. Listen. I went to hawaii as white as a ghost and came back a bronze goddess . However it kinda smells like soy sauce. So if you don’t mind smelling like Chinese food  and that’s worth being a bronze goddess purchase for sure"
169,B001ECQ4JE,"I've been using the Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion with Aloe for years.  It is the best body lotion and it keeps your skin smooth. I use this stuff for my moisturizer before makeup and for out of the shower…. It’s wonderful and doesn’t feel greasy at all! I don’t like Vaseline because it’s hard to clean off of your hands if you get too much on and I don’t think it evaporates well or quickly. This is wonderful, not oily or greasy and absorbs quickly. The scent is not overpowering though you can distinctly make it out. This lotion has been my go-to for a while now. Its fresh, light scent is unoffensive and easy on the nose. Its a great lotion to use in the summer since it soaks in pretty quickly and doesn't leave you feeling greasy. But, at the same time, it keeps your skin healthy and hydrated looking. I've even used this on my face and I can count on it to never clog my pores. I keep one bottle at my desk for when my hands get dry - I can continue working and since this lotion isn't heavy I can keep pounding away at the keyboard without slipping off or feeling like I need to wash my hands.  I keep another in the bathroom for everyday use and I throw the last one in my beach bag to use after a day in the sun. Voila! Perfect for the pack of three. I think Vaseline shrunk the bottle size by a few ounces but this will still last for quite some time, even with every day use. I HIGHLY recommend this lotion. It would be hard to be disappointed. I just wanted to say - drugstore brands are really stepping their game up.  My mom was in the hospital and my sister bought this lotion for her use.  Now normally I wouldn't have purchased it, because past experience taught me this was cheap and we would be ashy in 30 minutes.  Well, no, my skin was soft and very comfortable, no Ash anywhere- I mean who knew?  Vaseline is much improved and so am I.  They need to create a cream version, with lots of aloe, can someone ask them about doing that?  My skin loves creams, but this lotion is good too.  Very impressive 👍 I love this lotion and have used it exclusively years.  I live in Florida and am constantly in the sun and the pool.  This takes a toll on my skin.  Vaseline Intensive Care moisturizes beautifully and the aloe component soothes. I've been using Vaseline Intensive Care lotions for over half my life (25-plus years) after developing dry skin from swimming. I've used other brands over the years, but always come back to Vaseline. It goes on smooth after a shower. It doesn't sit heavy on the skin. And, for someone battling lots of sun damage from growing up in the spf 2/baby oil-era (yes, spf 2) I feel like I'd be a lot wrinklier if not for Vaseline. This is not the same product as pictured. It is the updated formula, which I did not want. I specifically searched for and bought this one because it shows that it was the old formula and not the new. Now I’m irritated because I have to return it"
170,B000OFNDMS,"Little small size She’s soft, lathers well, dries fast, and looks pretty. I like it will use for cleaning small outdoor fountain.  will use soon! I purchased 3 different sponges and this review will focus on the LATHER Natural Sea Wool Sponge.I bought this for bathing in the shower, so the first thing I did when it arrived was take it out of the packaging and rinse in a sinkful of warm, clean water. There wasn’t much to rinse out…no sand, sediment, sea creatures, etc. All in all, pretty much ready to use after a few bits of fluff came away. I kept squishing it in the water and the shedding was not an issue.First impressions: WOW—it smells like when I visit the beach in Florida (in a good way). I know beach smells can range from refreshing to gross. This sponge smells like fresh, clean, ocean breeze coming off the gulf. Minimal shedding. It wasn’t the softest of the sponges I bought, but it smelled the best and had a great size and shape for holding in my hands. As far as softness, I’m not sure I’d use this on a baby, but should be fine for a toddler. It’s like a really soft washcloth. I wish it was as soft as the Neptune sponge, although it’s a close second!My ONLY critique is that the “bottom” of the sponge, where it was cut at harvest, is a bit thick. This means it takes a few days to completely dry out. So mold could be an issue if you don’t wring it out completely and put it somewhere airy to dry in between uses. I might try cutting away a bit more of the thicker parts…we’ll see. It will probably soften a bit as I use it, too. Of the 3 sea sponges I bought, this one was the winner based on size and scent. Price seemed a little much, but not enough to keep me from buying it! I was really excited to try the LATHER Natural Sea Wool Sponge, but unfortunately my experience with it was not great. I was disappointed to find that the sponge fell apart after only a few uses. It started to unravel and break apart, and it became difficult to use. The sponge did produce a good lather and was gentle on my skin, but I was disappointed that it didn't last very long. I wouldn't recommend the LATHER Natural Sea Wool Sponge if you're looking for a durable and long-lasting sponge. It's a shame because I really liked the natural materials and the performance of the sponge, but it just didn't hold up well. I had for only one week and it fell apart and is in the trash Great quality sponge! Large and soft but can tell it will hod up for a very long time"
171,B001738HJ0,"After I washed my face with my daily soap cleanser, then I applied this  Eskinol to my face and wow I can see the difference in what my daily soap left behind to my skin.This stuff is amazing and it helps to cleared up my skin blemishes. Who knew and I’m really glad that I ordered this stuff, thanks Eskinol 👍 I use this everyday to take off the remaining dirt and oil off my face after I wash and it makes me skin look so smooth and soft to the touch after. I have huge pores and dry skin and this product doesn’t make my skin dryer at all. Lightened my skin and removed oil great product it is mostly used in the Philippines and I tried it there and I said I must have this in America I absolutely LOVE this item. I was born in the Philippines and arrived here when I was just a baby and I remember my mom was the one who recommended this product because she used it all the time back home.I love the way my face feels after putting it on at night, and I love the smell too.I will definitely be buying more of this product! I was so happy when I received my order. At first, I thought my package was not delivered yet, but the tracking says delivered. The best kind eskinol for improving your skin ( smoothens and clears dark spots). It improve my dark spot as early as 1 week. I really do like this product, and I did see results in the first week. I will reorder this product. hard to find items. good price."
172,B000AADF0M,"As far as the tanning part of it goes, it does it’s job. Adds a nice tint to your face. I can wear this and not need to apply foundation. I just use a little powder and I’m good to go. The thing I hate about it is, it sprays like a jet stream. Horrible!! If this would have a spray nozzle that was more of a mist then I would likely have given it 5 stars but instead, I brace myself and hope it doesn’t shoot me in the eye. Overpriced small bottle and it’s not giving me results I expected the first use anyway. The Sally Hansen Airbrush Face Self Tanner is great.  My daughter and I have used it for about four or five years and wouldn't use anything else.  My daughter is 27 and says since she has used it her complection has actually gotten better and it gives her just the right color, especially in winter when we both become ""winter white"".  I too have found it good for my complection.  Probably because it contains retinol but the color is perfect..not too dark...and lasts for several days.  I have never sprayed my face directly because I don't want to breathe it in.  I simply spray it on my fingers and apply it like make-up.  Therefore I know exactly how much and where it has been applied.  I hope they never discontinue this product.  It has been difficult to find it in stores. I've been using this for years. It gives me a healthy tanned glow and it makes my face look Skinnier.  I swear it must be the retinol which does great things for my skin for anti ageing.  I always seem to get compliments when I wear it. Unfortunately it is no longer available in Australia and I have to buy it on Amazon USA for double the price (but it's well  worth it!)  I really hope it's not discontinued!  Some people complain of the intense smell but u don't mind it as it reminds me of summer. I wear make on top. Love love. Keep selling this Sally Hanson! I use this face spray as soon as fall comes. Keeps my skin glowing all through winter. So natural It was ""Okay"" Had a faint smell, but not bad. Heard from people I looked kinda orangey. I didn't think so but that is what others told me. Easy to apply though. I don't know. I only used it twice. Maybe I oversprayed? It did fade nicely - no spots looking like I had some kind of skin disease. Maybe good for a one night thing? I order these on a regular basis. For me it works super well as a gradual tanner. I will use it for events to even my tan on my arms / chest/ legs, or I'll use it on my face every few days or so. People say I look tan, and I 100% notice a difference when I use it. Was super excited to receive/try this because of all of the favorable reviews. I do think it provides some (very) light color when used consistently. The can I received, however, was dated 2005! Thinking if it was actually NEW, and not expired, it would have done much better. Some were saying they used as a makeup/foundation. I also tried this, when I sprayed onto a makeup brush there was zero color payoff. (On the brush and then when applied to the face)...I would perhaps attempt to repurchase again, if I was assured it wouldn't be an outdated/expired product."
173,B001FB5IEG,"Amazon's purchases have been very pleasant with great delivery schedule and access.Great product for after shower use or hand moisturizer. I use it during the Chicago winters to keep skin moist.This item is NOT available with Subscribe and Save, I wish it was. I go thru plenty of Nivea's Body Daily Lotion, after all it does say 'daily' in the title. Growing up in Europe, I used to see my parents using Nivea creams a lot. As an adult, it took me a while to go back to that brand, maybe because the association with my parents made me consider Nivea too old fashioned? Shame on me. This is hands down the BEST body lotion I have been able to find in both supermarkets as well as department stores:PROS:- smooth texture: comes out of the bottle easily, rubbs on body easily and evenly;- fast absorption: you can almost watch it soak into your skin, leaving NO film residue behind;- non-greasy quality: makes your skin dewey, but not oily; your clothes and stockings are safe; I put it on directly after a shower/bath (when my skin is still slightly damp) and then let my body air dry while I progress with my morning routine; within minutes it is safe to put your clothes on;- superb moisturization quality: no ashy flakes in sight! leaves skin plump!- boutique scent: it is sofisticated, clean and barely there...will not overpower your perfume;- price: VERY reasonable for a body lotion!CONS:- The larger (400 ml a bottle) size comes with a pump; I like that option better due to the ease of application;Enjoy!"
174,B0010ED5FC,"I started using this in my third trimester. Before that, I used more expensive brands. Having no stretch marks, I continued with this product after getting a sample of them at the clinic. It has a gentle pleasant scent, nice texture and it absorbs very easily and really nourishes my skin. I use this all over my body and even my hands which really suffer from dryness and cracking during pregnancy. Honestly, this turned out to be the best hand solution for the money, and I know that my skin is not just getting glycerin, but is nourished by natural oils while remaining pleasant to the touch and without a greasy coating. I ordered the largest pack of 1 liter, it's definitely worth the money. Now I can apply as much cream as my belly and whole body needs, I don’t think it’s very expensive... and it’s so good that I will continue with it as a pampering body after childbirth. Great product! Will buy again Wanted to wait before reviewing this until I was well into my pregnancy. A friend recommended this and I’m so grateful she did. (She has zero stretch marks after 2 kids)I am currently 36+ weeks pregnant and couldn’t be happier. I started this pregnancy with some old stretch marks I’ve been carrying around since I was a teenager. I had just accepted I was going to gain more during pregnancy.I HAVE NO NEW STETCH MARKS! And amazingly those old stretch marks are mostly gone! I am shocked. They never really bothered me but I’m impressed I’ve lost stretch marks while pregnant!!I’ve use this product every day since week 7 of my pregnancy. I apply it after I shower and applying coconut oil first. My belly is so soft!!!!I will continue to use this even after I pop this nugget out and recovered. Super buena crema. L he usado durante toda mi barriguita y me hidrata mucho. La puedo tener toda la noche y cuando tomo un baño en la mañana sientes la crema bajo el agua. Me ha cuidado mucho. La volví a pedir y la seguiré usando hasta q vuelva a mi peso normal. El olor si me ha traído problemas durante los primeros meses d embarazo por los síntomas que trae el embarazo, es como mantequilla rancia jii pero muy buena. La recomiendo 100 % This product has a nice light floral smell that I enjoy, but in terms of moisture, it hasn’t really doneLast pregnancy I didn’t get any stretch marks (without using anything) so I’m not too worried about stretch marks, I just got this to try to help with my super dry/itchy skin.I’ll use the rest of it because it smells nice and it’s light, but I wouldn’t repurchase for my dry skin. This lotion contains Argan oil and collagen and is free of parabens and mineral oil.Although it's marketed for stretch marks,  I've used this consistently on my neck and upper arms for years! La crema es muy buena he tenido otros productos de la misma marca, pero no me gustó el envío llegó abierta y toda sucia algo que tú crees que es nuevo, no fue así. I love the way the lotion feels. It is nice and smooth, and feels smooth for hours. I use it twice a day and I really like it. Nothing negative to say. Very soothing for my third trimester itchy-belly! The scent is pleasant (for which I’m quite thankful, because I’m extra sensitive to smells while pregnant), and it doesn’t leave my hands feeling greasy, just moisturized, after applying. Love it!"
175,B000Q97ZS0,"Porque tan malas criticas yo estube probando cremas y gracias a un dermatatologo x unas cremas q me receto me mancho la cara se me formo unas manchas una en la mera frente y dos en cada mejilla menos notorias.pero la de la frente si me estresaba y mire un video en youtube de esta crema y n dude en comprarla porque amo las cosas naturales.y para sorpresa mia esta crema me quito las manchas increiblemente me alegre mucho...asi es que n se xq tiene comentarios tan negativos y yo con una sola crema tuve para ver resultados la recomiendo !!! If you are looking for a top cover lotion then buy it. If you are looking for something with long lasting moisture, don’t buy itIt absorbs quickly but then your face feels just as dry.I ended up using it sometimes as a face wash to be honest. Mine came in a jar without a label so I hope it is what I ordered!  I have used it three times of which my  face felt very dry, and had to put my regular moisurizer over it.  I want to see if it makes any difference to my skin, but so far I am not happy with it! I want to leave this cream a better review. First of all, I HAD severely dry lips. I have tried every cream, lip balm, lip scrub, lip plumper, lip you name it...and nothing worked to alleviate the dryness. I drink plenty of water and live in a humid state. This cream is the FIRST and I mean the absolute first thing that has ever healed my dry lips and made them soft again. They are not cracked, bleeding, lined looking and painfully dry anymore. I went to several dermatologists who basically told me to live with it or try petroleum jelly (gross). This only made them worse. So I ordered this cream originally for my skin...to moisturize, revitalize, hydrate, soften, and reduce wrinkles. The most pleasant surprise was that does not only do all this for my face, eyes, and marionette lines...but it also HEALED my ridiculous impossible to heal lip issues. It's nothing short of a miracle really. I'm very sensitive to smells and added ingredients which this cream is low on. There is basically no smell and it absorbs rapidly into the skin. I like to use it on my neck and chest as well. I can feel it staying in place and hydrating my skin all day without it feeling thick, oily, intrusive or greasy. So to make a long story short. This really is a MIRACLE creme for me because it did nothing short of a miracle when it actually moisturized and healed my lips even when I am not wearing it. It definitely helps improve lines and wrinkles, tightens and evens out the skin tone. I like to use a little bit of Marula oil some days to add extra glow and dewiness. I have never written this long of a review. I think very highly of this product and you can't beat the price either. Just amazing. If you are like me and were ar your wits end with DRY lips...try this! Thank you, Home Health :) It makes me sad that this moisturizer has such poor reviews. Believe me when I say I am PICKY about moisturizers - scent, texture, parabens, oils, sulfates, extracts, comoedegens, you name it - and this moisturizer meets ALL the requirements. It truly HYDRATES, not just moisturizes, your skin. It's much better than many high end moisturizers I have tried. I can tell that it isn't just sitting on top of my skin, feeling greasy and oily - it actually sinks into my skin and immediately begins to repair, restore, and brighten. I don't hate how it feels on my face and hands, which is a big deal. It is my go-to, especially in the winter. My skin is not very dry anymore but has a tendency for flaky patches. It also used to be very sensitive. This moisturizer has helped with both. It has never bothered my skin; in fact it is so gentle & soothing you could use it after face masks and (mild) chemical exfoliation. It's also great for stretch marks, sunburns, scars, razor burn, anything really! I recommend this product to EVERYONE. The smell is sort of weird, but it literally has every ingredient your skin needs in a hydrator & moisturizer all-in-one. Can't beat the price. I have been buying this product, through Amazon, for many years and I've had excellent results. I am 70 years old and my skin does not show lines of old age, moreover, it does not show lines of expression.However, the last one that I opened gave me an irritation, inflammation, stinging and acne-like red dots and I had to stop using it. I tried and looked for an expiration date, to find out if it could be the problem and was surprised that it was partially erased perhaps because of a bad printing process and it did not show a legible date.I want to tell you all that I feel very sad with this problem since I have felt very satisfied with the results obtained with the use of this cream over the years.It could be that I have developed an allergy to one of the ingredients or that I bought too many units and kept them for too long. I would like to know if anyone at Home Health could tell me the shelf life of the cream when kept on a dry and cool place and If it should not be used after a certain period of time.Maritza Yánez-Duran I'm 50+ years old, and I've used expensive anti-aging creams for the past 10 years on my face, neck and hands.I began to read of the benefits of hyaluronic acid added to face creams, so after searching and reading reviews on several brands, I decided to give this one a try. It gave the largest amount (4 oz) for a reasonable cost giving me a longer trial period to gauge results.I have been using it twice a day now for about a month, and have not even used 1/2 of the jar. I have to say that I personally am very pleased with the results! I notice the pores on my face have reduced in size, as well as the lines on my face and neck. My skin tone looks much more even and youthful.There is no fragrance added, which I'm glad of..there is a vitamin type of smell, but it is faint and fades after application.You do need to be aware that there is no sun protection in this, but if you wear other makeup/moisturizer that has SPF over this cream, you should be fine.I plan to use this product in replacement of the expensive anti-aging creams I've used for years, thus saving me money, and I feel the more natural ingredients in this will be better for my skin in every way over time."
176,B00028LN1K,"This soap is amazing, The scent can be VERY strong when you first receive the box. however, whether this is a pro or con the scent isnt as strong after getting out the shower. It leaves a slight tinge of the pine tar scent on your skin. It does leave the shower smelling AMAZING while using so its also therapeutic. It does a great job at giving you a very good clean feeling on your body face and even your hair and it lathers really well with some water. I have really long hair and i could compare this to some shampoos in terms of leaving my hair clean.the only concern i see with this soap is that it tends to run out pretty fast and like mentioned before it doesnt really leave a long lasting scent.but honestly its a great smelling soap its a bit strong at first but you'll fall in love with it pretty quick with use.The cons i can think of are subjective but if it matters to you here they are:1. Strong scent on arrival (not a big deal it goes away and its not a bad scent just differeent)2. Packaging is a hit or miss i've order a total of 3 of these so far and more than half of them can in a semi crushed box (doesnt matter much because its slight damage to only the box and the soap is completely fine and usable)3. Longevity isn't all the great, short lifespan in the shower. Get a soap box or a wooden tray to place it on to keep it lasting longer.4. Scent does not last on your skin. a slight scent of the soap for a bit and it goes away.5. Pricing  its like $5 for a bar more or less. in terms of soap its not cheap because you can get them for a dollar at a local store or walmart, HOWEVER, I feel this soap is WELL WORTH is price because it works so well.6. Once you buy one you'll want to buy more and you might look into buying more $5+ dollar soaps because this smells so good and cleans so well.In end result definitely buy this soap and give it a try. The scent you may or may not like,(its a very masculine scent i'll add) but it definitely cleans well.Try it. Are you bothered by fruity or girly scented soaps? Well look no further: this soap will leave you smelling like a MAN! A man who knows how to start a fire with his bare hands, a man who fights bears with his bare hands, a man who lost both hands in a bear fight, a man whokilled the bear who ate his hands with bare stumps, a man who had an operation to attach that bears head to his stump, a man who now fights bears with his bare bear hand! I don't really have any skin issues, but I heard good things about this soap and decided to give it a try. I really like how well it lathers, and it lasts a pretty long time when used with a mesh bath sponge. That said, the smell is overpowering. Not that it's a bad smell, but it will leave your bathroom smelling like a wood smoker. Maybe that's a plus for some people though lol. The smell does fade over time, but it's always noticeable when entering the bathroom. That said, it's not like the smell lingers on the body, at least as far as I can tell. Tried the soap out. I had had  ulcers behind my ears due to sharp ends on eyeglasses. Within a week they were gone. Very happy with this product! This arrived in a sealed plastic pouch.  As soon as I opened the plastic, the room was filled with a nearly eye-watering stank of hot tar.  Having read a bunch of reviews of this soap, I was expecting this to some degree, but this was a little more... aggressive... than I had been anticipating.  Two weeks later, and the smell has only slightly abated, much to the displeasure of the females in my house.With that said, I find this to be an excellent soap.  In the dry winter months, I have some problematic skin issues.  I have been looking into solutions, and I kept running into recommendations for this soap.  I've had pretty decent success with coal tar shampoos, and I thought I would try this stuff out.I find that it gets my skin and hair ""squeaky clean"" without the harsh drying that I get from other soaps.  Also, I had read many reviews of men saying that it was good for their beards.  That seemed weird to me, as most soaps tend to make beards dry.  Well, I can now verify that this has seemed to make my beard much more manageable without being greasy or whatever... just better.As for the smell on my skin, I have found that after I get out of the shower and dry off, it is noticeable, but not bad.  After about an hour, or so, it fades to a smokey/sweet smell that isn't offensive or pronounced, but still not entirely desirable to me. Hours later, if I press my nose to my skin, I can still detect it.  I was happy to note that no matter how much I sweat (I'm a runner and I do hard physical work), I do not notice that smell of tar.  I also have noticed that no matter how much I sweat, that body odor is practically nil.Pros:Lathers good (I have very hard water, and some soaps are not good in this regard)Leaves skin and hair remarkably clean feeling, yet soft and not dried-out.Oddly good beard cleaner.Good for a variety of problematic skin issues/ blemishes.Seems to be a very long-lasting deodorant.Cons:Smells like a tire fire.Really expensive.Has anybody mentioned the smell?I will probably continue to purchase this, although I will probably store it in the basement between showers...Despite not being a fan of the smell, I have been extremely happy with the effectiveness of this soap.  It has definitely lived up to the reports of its skin-clearing ability.Edited to add, 2/4/14:I've noticed that my hands are not nearly as cracked/chapped as they normally get during the dry winter months.Also, I've found a store local to me that sells this soap, and I noticed that the packaging was not sealed in plastic, like my Amazon purchase.  I guess with some ""airing out"" and age, the pungent aroma does calm down quite a bit.Also, also, I found out that this is made in Erlanger, KY.  Which is not too far from me.  I like supporting business as local to me as possible, so that is a nice little ""bonus"" that I hadn't initially realized.  Doesn't affect my rating, just thought I'd mention it.Finally:  Why am I writing this much of a review for a bar of soap?  Weird. I think this soap smells more like campfire ashes than pine sap. The odor is very strong and fills the bathroom. But the soap works well for hand washing. I tried using it for showering, but found out I'm allergic to it for some reason. I am not sure what chemicals of mother nature combine such that this product gives this natural deep clean, however i would order again for that reason. also is an excellent pre hand wash soap for delicate material with troubling spot."
177,B000GG2HOU,"I have gotten better at applying these.  The trick is to use it until the wipe is dry.  Wipe all over and keep blending.  I put in on with shorts and keep my legs uncovered as long as possible.  And moisturize the next day.  Using a shower oil when legs are still wet/damp and it will last quite a while. I both love and hate these wipes. I buy them several times a year. I love the ease of use and the skin tone result but I hate the smell! And unfortunately I've developed little brown, discolored speckles in random areas on my arms and legs since I began usingthe wipes. I don't know... maybe they'll go away if I completely stop using sunless tanners. Umumgood What the title says Wished it would last a little longer. I have tried every self tanner on the planet.  This one is great, but one towelette is only enough for my legs.  Frankly, I was amazed some people fold them up into a plastic bag for reuse.  You really have to ""use"" everything on the towelettes if you want nice color.  Biggest hint no one has ever told you to prevent streaking:  immediately after application, gently, very gently, rub your hands up and down your legs like you are softly putting on lotion.  Don't rub.  You can feel spots you missed with the towelette.  This insures that you have spread the tanning solution in an even application.  Next, consider wiping your knees or ankles gently with a tissue so they don't get too dark.  It's trial and error.  It will take you several applications to get this right......but all worth it. It's a gorgeous tan with the smallest hint of pink.  Spectacular!! Your legs may not look perfect the first time.....but maybe they will.  Remember to wash your hands. As always, a great product, and a great delivery.. Thank You put on lightly not to go too orange"
178,B001ESE2KG,"Excellent product. Softens in hand. Smoothens skin and exfoliates. It does go rancid eventually, better if stored in fridge. My 16 year-old son had troublesome acne. I tried almost everything and they only exaggerated his issue and dried his face out so bad to the point of discomfort. I never had acne but I've always resolved issues using holistic measures but my son was skeptical. So, him being desperate, I bought this, along with some bars of African black soap, and his face looks so much better. He especially loves how the cream feels on his face. It calmed the irritation, no more red blotches and dry patches. His acne reduced in severity by half and he's only used it for several days.  He doesn't show too much enthusiasm about anything but he sure did about this! Very happy kid!!! NH Honey & Black Seed is an incredibly effective moisturizer for all skin types including eczema, hives caused by allergens, acne, simply dry skin...etc. I use it for every minor irritation and have had zero eczema issues since starting my new skin care practices. No more proactiv. Now it is simple: 1.clean face using natural soap(castille and black soap) 2.Twice a week calcium bentonite mud mask 3. Homemade toner (witch hazel with some camphor, peppermint, eucalyptus, lavender, and tea tree oils) 4. NH Black seed and Honey or NH Vetiver and Hemp oil for serious blemish reduction.I highly recommend trying their soaps, lotions and salves. All have beneficial qualities and a little research goes a long way to find what is best for you. All their products are natural and some have very earthy smells that may be overpowering to some noses but that's what I love about them. The Honey and Black Seed smells like honey and is quite enticing.I make all my own salves, skin care items, lotions, and herbal remedies but NH got the ratios perfect and for my own medicine cabinet, I actually prefer their shea salves mixed with my own raw shea and oils because they have perfected the scent and I cannot obtain the quantities of raw ingredients necessary to produce a similar product that smells as wonderful as theirs. NH Shea butters are natural and fair-trade products. They actually get their raw shea from a little village in Ghana where their profits go towards things like digging wells and giving goats to families...not arming militant groups or diamond mining.NH has an amazing product line and it all started from a couple students in New York City that desperately wanted to bring natural, old-world remedies to an over processed society. The simple benefit of going natural in skin care (the largest organ in your body) has overpowering detox effects on your body. I can taste the petrol-based additives in processed food now...even my daughter takes notice when Vegetable oil is in a baked treat as opposed to regular butter. Fair warning: Going natural with your skin care will lead to whole body wellness and you will decide for yourself to cut out the 'crap' from your diet because it starts tasting bad. This moisturizer has a lot going for it: it's 98%  natural, it doesn't irritate the skin or cause breakouts, and it's very rich! This has helped restore my facial volume, calm down irritation, and even my skintone.  And it smells fabulous! Originally, I was going to return it because it smelled too strong, but it turns out I was using too much.Some advice on using it as a moisturizer:If you're oily-skinned like me, realize that this moisturizer will absorb very well, but your skin will still produce oil that kind of sits on the surface. Be sure to remove the oil your skin produces (I use blotting papers or tissues) so that it doesn't just sit there on your face and make a good environment for pimples.I like to put this moisturizer on while my face is still damp for the most absorption.You only need the smallest amount. I generally rub a pea-sized (or smaller) amount between my palms or keep it in a warm area so that it is easier to spread.  If you don't let it melt, it will be grainy and you'll have to work it in your face. I like to work this in my face anyway to give myself a nice face massage.Wait 15-30 minutes prior to putting on makeup so you can remove any residue or extra moisturizer you may have put on if you were being too generous.  If you don't have that kind of time in your morning regimen, this would be a fantastic night cream with something lighter during the day.It works VERY well under makeup.  I haven't had any problems with it balling up under oil-free foundations (I use MUFE HD, L'oreal True Match, MAC Face & Body, and Clinique Mattifying powder). I don't use face primers (I only use eye makeup primer),so I don't know if that would change the results. Remember, the oil from your skin will still come through (this isn't mattifying), but not in crazy amounts. Make sure to blot WELL after applying your makeup and to set with a mattifying powder in your oily areas and things will stay under control for several hours."
179,B000BD0SEE,"I’m pregnant so my skin is going crazy. I am incredibly dry, but with hormonal bumps only under my chin and jawline. And my chin. My sister Julianne Romney, wild herbs of Arizona… is an amazing herbalist and all of us sisters go to her for suggestions on healthy products. Anyways she suggested this so me and my older sister got some. My older sister says it works miracles for her! And it works miracles for me too! It dried up the acne ( I do moisturize heavily because of pregnancy dryness) but the combo of using this and my Burt’s bees face cream with honey work sooo well! My face is glowing and clearer than ever. I let the face wash sink into my skin for best results. There’s something about the enzymes that really does break up dirt and I’ll see dirt come out and gather in a ball sometimes. Then I wake up to the most clear face ever. I don’t think I’ll ever buy different face wash From my wife: ""Some of my local sources for MyCHELLE Dermaceuticals Fruit Enzyme Cleanser are gone, so I'm pleased to find it on Amazon. And for a much lower price!  It's been my favorite face-wash for a few years, as it's gentle and does not dry out my skin."" My wife loves the product. It feels nurturing. Afterwards, the face feels really clean. Highly recommend it. Natural - perfect. I love this stuff! I’m 37 with PMDD. I get painful cystic acne that is hormonally related. This stuff has been amazing. I have dry skin and this doesn’t make me drier. I will still get a few pimples right before my period but I used to get a full beard of pimples. The few I get I can clear up with a dab or press-gel.The bottle seemed small for the price but a little goes a long way. I make sure I dry my hands before pumping it into them otherwise the product slides off. Gentle face wash with mild fruity scent. A small amount is all I use morning and evening. Non drying to my skin. Every time I add another MyChelle product to my regimen, my skin takes a noticeable turn for the better. After using this twice today, my skin is noticeably brighter and healthier. It has a light, sweet citrusy/lemon scent, and the creamy gel lathers up nicely. If you let it sit on your face for a minute you can actually slough away the dead skin with your fingers as you rinse. I am an absolute fanatic for this brand. Their products are truly non-toxic, and in my 10 years of being a natural & organic skin care junkie, they are the only products that have ever truly followed through with their claims and shown visible results for my skin. I highly recommend them to everyone now since I've discovered these products. A huge majority of ""natural"" skin care brands now are using phenoxyethanol, which is toxic and is something i have to stay away from. So not only am I thankful to MyChelle for this reason, but their products truly work and the formulations are just beautiful. I feel like I'm at the spa every time I wash my face now! I did some research as to best facial cleansers for hormonal acne and this was on the list.  I have tried others and found them very medicinal smelling.  This has a pleasant bright citrus smell and my skin has been clearing up week after week.  Also liked the price and will definitely be buying again!"
180,B0013IT86U,"I'm at the beach every weekend.I've used this product for decades.It works and smells pretty good.However, when you go to see your dermatologist and they ask you if you use any kind of skin protection product with an SPF factor in it, it's probably not a good idea to mention this one.They look at you with astonished amazement to see if you're being serious.I told mine ""well, yes, it does have an SPF protection rating of ""4"".They continue to stare at you wondering if you've been released permanently from the mental health care facility where you reside of if you're just out on a 3 day pass.Then they start to look at their assistants because they can't believe what they are hearing either.My dermatologist is pretty cool, though.  She left the room and came back in with all kinds of stuff that had SPF values of 50 and higher.  She said ""Normally we only give out the sample sizes but you REALLY need to start using these other things and I'm giving you the Jumbo sizes which we normally don't do but...""Anyway, we had fun doing biopsies and assorted other FSA (fun skin activities) and yes, I've added the Big Guns skin products to my regimen but I really love this Aussie Gold.  It smells good and it's been such a part of my life for so long it's hard to just not use it entirely.  So I do a half and half mix to keep her happy and what not.You won't be disappointed with this if you want to use at least something to ward off UV's but still get a nice tan, smell good  and keep your dermatologist at bay.  Sort of. Was happy Australian Gold came out with a SPF 50 product. This smells good, goes on smooth, stay on after getting wet, and protects your skin like a champ. Wish the would get this out to retailers to make it easier to acquire. Thanks Amazon for carrying. Adds a slight color while providing SPF sun protection.  Australian Gold is our exclusive sun product brand.  I've used many of  their products for years and years.  Nice variety of products available. This is the best product! It has a bronzer that is really nice. I never want to run out! The seller sent it before it was due! Many thanks! 👍 Love this product just not happy it came leaking. Which I understand happens. Nice product Nice for the money. Excelente"
181,B000OYJ9AO,"I tried this on a whim and now my skin feels whimsical.  Like really people! Why isn't this known world wide? The reviews are real! Smells great and works even better! I usually get excema from scented lotions but not this one. I didn't feel like I needed more lotion all day! And even better there is a ""hemp"" leaf on the front. 🤣 It smells so good! I love using it all the time I feel so good after using it on my hands. It definitely hydrates my dry hands. All there products are awesome. This is the first lotion I have used that stops my dry skin from flaking off everywhere. It made my skin soft and smooth after my first use. I did not have “snow” all over my clothes and floor. I purchased my mom a bottle as well and she no longer “snows” all over either. It is worth every penny. Don’t look any further this lotion is an excellent product. I was so happy to find this lotion at a more decent price. It’s exactly what it says on the description. I only gave it a 4 star because the top part where you pump was broken when I received it. Otherwise, I am happy with this purchase. Love this lotion! It works well, it's  not oily and it smells so good! I purchased the Pineapple/Melon version (after finally getting really tired of the nasty chemical smell of the ""anti-age"" unscented version).  I must say this lotion is the softest, most wonderful smelling lotion ever. It really does smell like fresh pineapples.  It is so light and juicy smelling that I could eat myself!  The scent is super long lasting and the lotion itself absorbs right in with NO greasy residue.  It's well worth the money. However...I will go through it very fast as I use it on my entire body every day now. I love that it has all natural ingredients and is cruelty free, and that's a BIG must for me.  I highly recommend it, especially for all the singles out there still trying to smell nice for your partners. ;)P.S. Someone stated it is colored with a chemical that can cause behavioral problems in children, and that is just not true.  This product has all natural ingredients. The original body lotion is my favorite!  The scent is not overpowering and the lotion is the best at moisturizing and soothing your skin. I love the scent. And it is great for dry skin."
182,B0009EXOXW,"The best, I mix with a couple drops young living frankincense oil in the palm of my hand and rub in my face. Careful to avoid eye I had this sitting around on my nightstand for awhile, not using it. It had a strange scent that seemed 'off' until I realized I needed to shake before use. Then it smelled great and worked fantastic.  Now I'm addicted to the stuff, use it daily morning and night, gives such a nice sheen to my skin.  It is a bit sticky for awhile after applying it, so I have to put my hair up until it all soaks in. Small price for how it makes my skin look. Love Source Naturals brand. This is the best product EVER!!!!!! This Serum works BEST with the Skin Eternal Cream. So you must purchase both. They each guarantee great results, but when paired, MY GOODNESS WHAT AN OUTCOME! So i recently reviewed the Skin Eternal Cream and I'd like to post it here, since it talks about how wonderful the Serum is too. They really work beautifully together. I get compliments on my skin ALL THE TIME and I can not imagine living without this cream. So here's my review and this price is unbeatable!I have tried EVERYTHING, and i mean EVERYTHING, when it comes to anti-aging products. I've used Olay, Loreal, Nutregeuna, Chinese products, Revlon, etc. NOTHING works better than Skin Eternal. It is by far the best anti-aging cream out there. You can do the research on it's ingredients. DMAE, Vitamin C Ester, and CoQ10 are essential in building collagen and reducing wrinkles, firming and even lifting. It works best with the Skin Eternal Serum. I put the serum on first. The serum absorbs very quickly, so I just wait like 5 minutes before putting the cream on. The Serum is a pump, so 2-3 pumps is perfect for the entire face. I massage in gentle upward motions. Then I let the Serum absorb into my skin. 5 minutes later, I apply the cream. The cream is thick, and has a scent to it, but it's such a magical cream. You can feel it working the second you put it on your skin. The improvement in skin texture, brightness, firmness, youthfulness, softness, and plumpness. All these things happen instantly when putting the cream on. It's literally that fast, and amazing. It feels like the fountain of youth. These two products paired with a great diet, exercise, and lot's of passion and happiness equals a beautiful life. This cream will stay with my forever! People compliment me all the time on my skin, and they think I'm still in high-school. An added bonus about this cream is that I dab a bit of it under my eyes, and it brightens, moisturizes, and smoothes my eyes. All you need is a lil bit. I also put this on my lips, and it is the BEST lip plumper I have ever used. It plumps up my lips and puts a rosy color to them. It's great. I don't have to wear foundation when I go to work. I just put some mascara, and blush and my face looks picture perfect. You will not be disappointed. If you're a woman from age 18-100, you need this cream. It protects against aging as well as reverses the signs of it. It's MAGNIFICENT!! It does better than any other product for the purpose, tightens skin, but it does sting upon application, sometimes worse than others, maybe it will subside. But, it works. Other products burn my eyes as the day wears on, this one does not. The effect is worth the sting.  I tend to believe that after it's applied and absorbed for a while I can wash it off, and sometimes I do; like I said it's worse sometimes, and I've only been using it less than a week. But it really works. (Now a month later, the sting dwindles very fast.)Some people whine about the smell, I think that's just whining, some people need to do that. I can smell it up real close in my hand, but regardless it dissipates rapidly after applied. 'Guess you can be stinky or saggy.I've tried a lot of skin creams and serums that boast DMAE content, but this one has it as a primary ingredient, as opposed to the others. I've tried compounding my own formulas as well, and have come close to this, but why mess around, life is short.I highly recommend this product for what it does, which is what I bought it for: It tightens skin, erases wrinkles, fast. Unlike virtually any other product I've tried, and I'm ooold, I've tried a bunch. I probably better stock up, because whenever I find a good product, it gets discontinued.'Gotta go reorder. Bye. Really great product. I just wish my bottle was full. Might have just been a one time error! I'd still buy again Been using for years...way cheaper than big name products with vitamin C and works awesome. I love this serum. I've used it and the DMAE serum together but I'm not sure they're very different so now only use one or the other. One thing to point out is that the directions say to use 1-4 drops. It's difficult to figure out how to get 1-4 drops from the pump but I've found that if you barely squirt the pump you get about a dime-size amount that once you spread across your palms is perfect to cover your entire face. Too much serum and your face will feel sticky and tacky.I've been using this serum for about 6 months now and I notice my skin appears tighter and brighter and that my skin feels incredibly smooth. Also, where I used to sometimes feel an oily build up around my nose is now clear and smooth. I apply this once in the morning and once at night after cleansing. I use the smallest drop of oil over the top for a moisturizer and my skin is very happy.I've always looked on the younger side of my age but I've noticed more comments along the lines of ""Oh, you look young!"" when asked my age, and younger people thinking I'm in my late 30s (I'm 46)."
183,B00021B95W,"So, I thought coconut frosting with small, super good, but I was disappointed by the scent. It wasn’t very Coconutty. But what I love is the fact that you can use it as a shampoo AND a body wash. This time I will be ordering a different scent and see if I like it better. All in all this is a wonderful great product. I think philosophy's vanilla birthday cake bath and shower gel contains one of the best scents that the company produces. It is light yet pleasingly sweet and reminds one of pleasurable baking experiences. Especially around your birthday, it is a must! This is new favorite body wash.  Came quickly and well packaged.  I only wish they made a body lotion the same scent. This stuff is awesome and the big bottle rocks I smell very good after using this, always get compliments My favorite shower gel! I love citrus  smelling stuff. Usually I find them with a light smell or not at all.  I find this soap smells a lot like lemon custard. My only problem  is I wish they made lotion  too. Always enjoy Philosophy. Only Shower gel I use."
184,B0013YYNDM,"I'm new to using castor oil as a hair & health benefit. What I can share is that my bottle arrived on time and in pristine condition despite the fact the driver left the box upside-down. I will update my review after a month of use. I love this product and can't wait to use it, Thick and gooey, In dark glass ,Organic and hexane free, just like castor oil should be !  I was not paid for this review I received my castor oil along with other ordered items in a timely manner.  Everything arrived all in one piece and no damages/breakages, due to exceptional shipping/packaging practices.  Thank you for that.Prior to ordering this castor oil, thanks to the internet, I learned you should buy organic castor oil that is cold pressed and is hexane free.  It’s because this met that criteria, I bought this castor oil.  Due to being indoctrinated into the world of essential oils, I have learned that all oils should be stored in a dark glass bottle.  This oil met that criteria.Since my hair has become extremely dry, fly away, lifeless, and dull resulting in hair breakage, I decided to try a hot oil treatment to resolve my problem.  I chose castor oil for this purpose because it’s what my mother used on her hair when I was a child (She also administered it to us as a “spring” tonic every spring stating it would cleanse our liver – and boy, did it work!).I warmed my castor oil in the microwave for a few seconds and applied it directly to my hair by pouring it all over my head (big mistake).  I then massaged the oil into my scalp and throughout my hair.  After about five minutes of doing this, I put on a shower cap and sat under a hair dryer for 30 minutes.  After removing the shower cap, I massaged the oil into my scalp and hair again.  Then I washed my hair – not only one time; but two more times.  I still had oil in my hair!  This is how I learned a little goes a long way.  Especially, since the oil has the consistency of raw honey.  The next time I use this, I will use a condiment container with a pointed end to apply directly to my scalp and just massage the oil onto my scalp and the ends of my hair.  I might also use another oil with it like coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil it just to thin it a bit.  Even with this mishap, my hair was soft, more controllable, and began to come back to life.Since ordering this castor oil, I have done a little research on it and have learned some of its medicinal properties.  I have also learned homeopathic doctors have prescribed castor oil “packs” to their patients for various ailments with great results.As you know, packs aren’t the only way to apply castor oil topically.  You can simply apply directly onto the skin and massage the oil into the skin.  When I did this; it felt rather heavy and tacky at first but it later soaked into my skin.  Apparently, it’s good to use for dry skin.  There is a warning to test for possible skin allergies prior to applying to a large area, though.  I think I will combine it with another oil for this, too.You can also soak a cotton ball with oil and apply it to an affected area, covering it with a Band-Aid for treatment.  This is a method of treatment for toenail fungus.  Nightly treatments take about two months to see any results.  Best results are seen if you soak your foot in an Epsom salt bath prior to treatment.You can even use this as massage oil.  Personally, I think I would add essential oils to it, as well as coconut oil.It’s well documented for use as a hair growth stimulant.  So I won’t elaborate on this subject other than to use an applicator brush when applying to the eyebrows or eyelashes (you can also use a Q tip for the eyelashes).Did you know it can be used to treat dry eyes.  One drop in each eye applied twice daily should do the trick.  I’m giving this a try!  Oh, it can also be used for treatment of dark circles under the eyes!I also learned it’s good to use for the treatment of acne.  I’ll have to tell my daughter about this!  And the list goes on and on.I strongly suggest you read a book entitled “The Oil that Heals” to learn of its many holistic uses.I received this product at a discounted rate to review, giving you my honest and unbiased assessment of said product.  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to provide you with this review and hope it was helpful in you making an informed decision.  I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my review.Please hit the “Yes” button if you found this review helpful. I have used castor oil for a long time but no other castor oil compares to this one. I love that it is organic. We will continue to buy this castor oil above any other. It is great.....goes on my skin smooth......soaks in and dries and does a fantastic job. I got this product for my liver packs. After 3 caster oil packs my stabbing liver pains have reduced. I like that this product is huge bottle for a great price. I will buy again! I use this for my castor oil packs. It is the only brand I feel safe to use. Lots of oils on here are adulterated, please do your research and choose wisely. You don’t want to be absorbing all kinds of chemicals. A good product! Comes in a colored bottle to protect the castor oil for a longer shelf life. Nice quality, great value for the money"
185,B0019LV2QU,"Great for moisture and great To use as a mixture in essential oils. I’ve noticed how fast and strong my nails have grown since using it on my cuticles. Also great to use on your face as it absorbs fully and helps to clear up face and improve texture of your skin definitely recommend I’ve been using this extra strength oil on my skin for about 20 years now, maybe longer. Im extremely hypersensitive to skin lotions, fragrances, etc., but for all these years I’ve been able to use this moisturizer, healer.  ** I can’t say enough about this oil!!  this pure Vitamin E oil, tocopherol acetate, literally will heal burns, scrapes and scratches on your skin in a matter of a few days, sometimes within hours. It makes blemishes disappear. It helps your skin retain a youthful look. In some cases it’s better than any antibacterial ointment. I’ve been using it for so many years that I’ve seen first hand what a miracle worker it is on light burns, rashes, cuts, scrapes, blemishes, mottled skin, stretch marks, scars to name a few. I’ll never be without it. Even for pets!! This oil eliminated a growth on my dogs paw, it healed a case of hot spots and healed a scrape on my dogs leg nearly overnight. This extra strength Vit e oil 32,000 IU is a must have in everyone’s first aid kits!Having said that, However, I’ve recently noticed a vague scent of some type of tincture in it, not sure what it is but now when I apply it on my skin it causes my skin to burn and the slight medicinal scent makes my head ache so I have to stop using myself but I’ll always have a bottle of this for my family and for my pets.I’ll continue buying it hoping that at some point it’ll be processed like it was a few years ago with absolutely nothing but vitamin e oil in it and not a hint of anything else. This 45,000IU unscented formula is thicker as it is in pure form. The 14,000IU formula is mixed with a scented essential oil, it's great as a facial oil. Per my dermatologist all the scar tapes have vitamin E as a main ingredient, getting pure oil is best with a tegaderm patch & more affordable Five years ago I tried a different Vitamin E product on a surgical incision with absolutely no results. So when I had surgery last year, I decided not to bother.  However, after 6 months this new incision was not only unsightly, it itched like crazy. Not expecting too much, I ordered this product based on reviews. After the first application I could see a reduction in redness and the awful itching was relieved. A few weeks later the incision continues to fade, and any red areas remaining in the old incision have disappeared. I am very happy to have found this product. This product is amazing. I developed a scar on the bridge of my nose from wearing masks daily at work.i have been using this product for 3 days.i apply once in the morning and once in the evening. My scar has faded drastically. This product definitely does what it's suppose to. I use to use the shea moisture body oil, but this is way better I love the scent and I’m left soft like a damn baby after I had surgery late last year and ended up with a 6 inch scar on my leg. I have been rubbing this oil into the scar and it has faded so much! My only complaint is the first few times I used it, I was extremely itchy and had to wipe it off. Takes your skin a few times to get used to. Perfect for what I need it for. Moisturizing and hydrating. Will be ordering again when I need to restock."
186,B0013OXHYI,"This moisturizer is perfect for combination or oily skin under make up in the am. Due to lack of a bottom front tooth and crowded teeth in general, as I'm aging I get vertical wrinkles around the mouth and bagging and wrinkling around my eyes.  I use a drop of Dawn dish drops in a half thimble of water carefully applied to these areas prior rubbing in several drops of this cream.  It ks to speed absorption and lasts for about 6-7 hours.  Coconut oil at night helps also to keep wrinkle areas plumped, especially as I'm on diuretics to help drain lower leg swelling, but they are systemic and shrink moisture from the face also.  Because of many meds I now frighten small children with my appearance, so this stuff helps when in public. I use this in the mornings after the Now Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I'm in my 30s and trying to combat forehead wrinkles.  I like how this product is lightweight and absorbs well.  I also like how its ingredients aren't scary.  Lately though I've been moisturizing with Jojoba oil or Grapeseed oil before I get out of the shower and this really seems to help the moist.  Considering so many moisturizers feel greasy and/or are loaded with toxins, I'm happy with this product and will consider reordering when it runs out.  (That's another thing - you do get a lot, or at least you don't need to use a lot - mine has lasted a few months already using it every morning on face, neck and chest.) A nice hydrating moisturizer that I use every morning. The hyaluronic acid keeps my skin looking amazing and youthful! It has a faint, but pleasant scent. It is affordable and better than any super pricey facial moisturizer that I have tried. I've been using it for years and consider it a must have in my beauty regimen. I 'LOVE ' these creams, both the a.m. and the p.m.!!!  I've been using the PM cream for years. I needed a new tube so I searched for the product and didn't find it right away. I felt the blood drain from my face as I said to myself ""oh no, this is the only cream that works for me! Don't tell me they stopped making it""!!!  Then I found it and felt much relief! I decided to purchase both the p.m. and the am cream. There is nothing that I would say needs improving. I just recently found this moisturizer and decided to try it for its Hyaluronic Acid properties. I find it that it does moiturize my skin, it is non greasy or oily. At first the skin feels somewhat dry, but when you touch the skin, it feels very soft and supple. The price is very reasonable and a great value for the money! Amazing moisturizing and plumping creme. It helps to keep my skin clear. It smoothes my skin before I apply my makeup. I love this brands ingredients. Makes skin feel soft and smooth, and isn't greasy. Has a nice light scent and does not agrivate my allergies. Nor does it cause me to break out. This is a good product for normal to slightly dry skin, but it may not be hydrating or emollient enough for dry to severely dry skin.  I have really come to enjoy the Now Solutions line of products. They don't disappoint, they use natural ingredients, and they're affordable..."
187,B00014DU6G,"It is easy to use and it is a gentle cleaner. Great for sensitive combo skin I love this cleanser and have used it for many years. It is safe to use and is very gentle but removes makeup and mascara like a pro! Thanks for such a great product! This is the best facial cleanser I have tried.  I have purchased about 6 or 7 times now and my skin looks great.  Why?  Not so much what this has in it but what the PH is.  It is very hard to find a facial cleanser that is at the right PH. Most are 7, 8 or higher - more alkaline.  Many companies formulate their cleansers that way to avoid eye irritation.  Unfortunately this is not good for your skin because it takes 20-30 minutes for your skin's PH to normalize after you wash it with a product with a too high PH.  That is alright if you wait that long before you put on an ""active"" like a BHA. AHA, Vitamin C product or Retin-A. However, with a cleanser like this one which has a PH of 5 you can apply your product immediately without worrying that it will be ineffective.  I have noticed a drastic difference in my skin with just simply switching to this cleanser but changing nothing else in my skin care routine; PH is very important in order for the products you apply to do what they are suppose to do!  This is especially true if you suffer from acne and find that your acne products are not working. Try to switching to a lower PH cleanser and see how much better your skin will look. Working well I have combination skin (oilier t-zone and acne prone) and have used just about every cleanser - from drugstore to department store - that a person can use. I've finally settled down with Earth Science! It's not drying, makes me feel like I have a smooth and oil-free canvas for makeup in the morning, and removes makeup really well (I've used it with a Clarisonic brush and without, and either way I've never had any residue on my towels) at night. I also love that this product is from a natural line - I've been trying to ""green"" my routine and I've worried about the efficacy of natural products, but this one is fantastic. I started using it with the ES Clarifying Herbal Astringent and the Almond Aloe moisturizer, and both of those have been wonderful at managing oil without stripping my skin, too. I bought my first bottle at Whole Foods for about $12 and it lasted FOREVER, but it's slightly cheaper from Amazon and I've started purchasing from here instead when I need refills. For the price and the quantity you get, it's definitely worth a try! I really love this facial wash. The hyaluronic acid ingredient really softens my skin, and it has a very fresh, yet light scent. And I'm very picky about scents - many personal products make me gag when they smell ""perfumy."" This does not. Earth Science makes nice products.This is so nice that when my daughter and 13 year old granddaughter came for a visit, they said that they tried it out when they saw it on the shelf, and were amazed at how nice it is. They said they were going to start buying it too. What else do you need? The ingredients aren't gross (on the contrary, I'm always transported to a magical hippie place when I glance at the label), it smells expensive (I know, I'm shallow), it makes my oily skin feel completely refreshed and clean without the squeaky-gross feeling that the big brand facial cleansers tout. It lasts forever (only one half-pump is needed) and it's exceptionally well-priced for the quality.It works well at removing makeup and oil, yet is extremely gentle and non-drying. I follow with their toner and also am a huge fan of the Earth Science face mask (peel). I've noticed a definite difference in the clarity of my pores and I have fewer breakouts as well (I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin but I'm in my thirties. Which is a lot of fun!)I switched back to the Dermalogica face wash last month because I happened to be in the mood to blow money that I don't have, and I must say, I prefer this stuff any day."
188,B001441QCW,"I have extremely dry skin due to an illness and a nurse recommended a drugstore body lotion that's full of preservatives and chemicals, and it worked, but I'm not spreading that stuff on my skin. None of my mostly natural lotions were cutting it, but this one absolutely does. It's rich and creamy, absorbs quickly, and keeps my skin soft for more than a day. It is the best I have ever tried. I can always add a drop of essential oil or my favorite scent to it if I feel like it, which I love. Truly one of the best body lotions I've ever used. I have been using this product for a long time now, and keep coming back to it.  It has a mildly fragrant scent (which I love!), and it sinks into my skin quickly, without leaving any visible white film or greasy layer.  According to my trusty app that shows ""dirty"" ingredients , this lotion comes near perfectly clean.  I would highly recommend, and will continue to love this lotion. This product was recommended to me by a friend who also went through chemo. I have used it for 2 years and it works the best- no scent, no irritation, goes on smooth, absorbs quickly.  My skin changed so much , have been extremely happy with it. Sa much as I liked my previous moisturizer, the chemicals were irritating me in treatment.My only problem was the pump just wouldn’t pop up this last time, so luckily I had my old pump and just switched- I use every last drop- even cutting it open towards the end :) I love this lotion, and have been using it for years. Product quality is still excellent. Packaging is not excellent. The past 3 bottles I purchased have had pump dispensers that do not unscrew to pop the plunger up into position for use, or just do not work. Again, the pump doesn’t work properly on this bottle I received.Disappointed and frustrated. I've loved this lotion for a long time but the new yellow bottle is so hideous I cannot have it out in my house or buy this product again, so disappointing I bought this for one of my daughters as part of her Christmas gifts.  She has very delicate and sensitive skin.  This is the best moisturizer for her.  There's no scent and it soaks in quickly. If your looking for a good lotion that softens your skin and keeps it soft!  You'll love this one!! Amazing moisturizing!!! Kept my skin amazing the whole brutal winter!"
189,B000052YQU,"Due to the cold Midwest winter months, my skin has been really dry and dull. Unfortunately, this includes my face which leaves my makeup looking cakey and flaky. I also have the joy of having combination dry and oily skin, so I am often worried than curing the dryness will cause more oiliness. Thus, I am typically leery of using any kind of heavy face cream.I came across Pond's Dry Skin Cream on Amazon. It seemed to be a reasonably priced option to help cure my dry face. I figured it was worth a shot, so I ordered a jar. I have been really happy with the results! It has really taken the dryness away, but I have not noticed any increase in oiliness. I wash my face, use toner, then apply this liberally before going to bed. My face looks much brighter and more moisturized, and I can go back to my normal makeup routine again!I have tried a lot of higher end brands, but I always come back to this when my face is particularly dry. I would highly recommend this product! How long has Pond's Dry Skin cream been around?  I don't know, but I used to buy it at Woolworth's.It's a great cream when your skin is dry but you don't feel like spending a fortune for some miracle in a jar.  It's rich, but not greasy, and it disappears quickly.I don't usually use it under my foundation, but I do put it on my neck.  If you're over 40, look at your neck skin in a close-up mirror and you'll see why.  I keep a jar by the bed too, for hands and feet.The smaller 3.9 oz size can be hard to find, so I'm happy to find it here. I bought ponds cold cream and got hooked so I decided to try their facial moisturizer.For a little background, I usually buy my skincare from Macy's. But once I found ponds cold cream to better than the high end stuff, I made a quick switch!I have very dry skin. I use a department store serum and eye cream, and this moisturizer and ponds cold cream cleanser. I couldn't be happier!This cream actually works better, and leaves my skin eat softer and smoother than high end brands. It seems to last long also, I don't need to reapply.I don't know if ponds makes serums or eye creams, but from my experience I'd give them a shot based on how great the other products, including this, work! Very moisturizing for winter. I was in need to switch from my lighter moisturizer to a heavier one for the cold, drier months. This fit the bill and the price was great. It's rich, absorbs well and leaves my skin very soft. I apply it at night and go to bed and in the morning and in the morning, I wake up with soft skin. I use an spf moisturizer through the day. I haven't found this cream to clog my pores either but I have dry skin. Worth checking out if you're looking for a thicker cream for winter. Arrived on time! This leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. It isnt thick and doesnt feel sticky like some lotions do. Unfortunately it doesnt completely help with my dry skin. It does a pretty good job but my fave still feels kind of dry. Sometimes if i use it day and night after a few days then the dryness is less but i dont always have the time to wash my face morning and night. It works better after washing my face because i have tried just putting it on when i dont have time to wash my face and it is less effective at moisterizing. I just can't seem to like it. The fragrance is not me, and I didn't see any improvement over the product I have been using.  Sorry, but I went back to Eucerine. I use this as my face lotion. It is not greasy and works very well to moisturize your skin. I also use it on my arms and legs when my eczema shows up in the dry winter months and it makes a big difference. If I start using this when I see my eczema start to show up then it is gone after a couple days.I have also used this on my toddler and it works well on her skin.My husband will sometimes use this on his hands as it does not leave your skin greasy and slippery. It is well worth the price to have this lotion. I like this cream, but I don't love it.  The pros are it hydrates my skin and it's good for sensitive skin.  I've been using it periodically for several months and I've never had a reaction to it and I'm ultra-sensitive.  The cons are it doesn't really do anything else.  My skin gets particularly dry in the winter months and that's when I first purchased it and used it religiously for several weeks.  My skin felt decent, but I didn't see a noticeable difference.  I switched it up to another brand and still use this every once in a while because I do like the smell and the consistency."
190,B001ET78CY,"Smells so good and leaves my hair looking beautiful I have curly hair and this does not weigh it down it allows my curls to flow free and natural. I also have very sensitive skin where most products irritate my follicle this does not. I love this product!! My go to to tame those frizzy moments and to refresh my ends when they look dull and dry. I purchased this product a long time ago. A little goes a long way (so I'm not going to do the subscription thing Amazon requests). That said, I haven't used it in some time and I recently had my hair colored magenta. My original hair is dark so I had to have it bleached. I LOVE the color, but almost I immediately regretted it. The way the stylist styled it, made it TOO straight. (I like body) But I waited a week to wash it so I wouldn't lose the color. For a week I was depressed. My hair was dry, flat, dead, and fly away. I kept it braided or just messy (rock star chic). But I wasn't happy.Now, one week later, the color set, so I washed it with MY products. The night before, I put a ton of Giovanni hair serum in it. (You really don't have to, but my hair was in bad shape). The next morning, it was soft. But the real result was I washed it, and WOW, it looks better than it did in a very long time. It's so soft, I can't stop touching it. And the smell is awesome.I highly recommend this product, especially if you have processed hair. Since Amazon only offers a subscription for this particular product, I purchased another one from the same Giovanni line. I will report back, but I'm sure it will be positive! Me encanta Love it I can get very frizzy hair and can't seem to find just the right products. But I remember years ago - before changing over to natural products and going by the curly girl method (mostly anyway) - I used to use and love John Frieda Frizz Ease, so I decided to give this a try. Though I wouldn't call it a game changer, it's helpful for sure. I use it on my damp hair before adding any other products (leave-in co, curl enhancer, and gel) and I carry it on me when out in case I get a fuzzy head. I especially like it just after getting my hair cut and styled as I tend to be extra fluffy and lacking my preferred curl definition afterward.I love that this stuff doesn't make my hair greasy at all. I can use quite a bit and it doesn't weigh me down or look wet. My hair looks softer with some shine after use. I often use about 3 pumps (sometimes more or less, depending) for my whole head.The smell is nice, but I gave it a 3 only because it is fragrance and I would prefer something natural. This brand has a tendency to use fragrance despite how natural they are and I'm so not a fan. Nevertheless, I buy many of the products.For reference, I have long, fine, naturally blonde, caucasian hair that's wavy/curly, super thick, and - of course - frizz prone. I highly recommend this serum for frizz-free results for curls. I apply all of my other products first, diffuse then use this serum (quarter size amount for my length) to scrunch out my gel cast. I wouldn't recommend the avocado and olive oil serum for anyone with fine, thin or straight hair because it is heavy. It's perfect for tight curls, which I especially in the front. I also put a little on my fingertips for finger coiling. The smell is amazing and not overpowering whatsoever."
191,B000NWDSAE,"I’ve been using this for 4 years and it works best when you leave it on for a few minutes then rinse but it’s always worked. My son likes to use this and I found the price on Amazon was very reasonable. He says the product works well for him, but can be a bit drying. Great in combo with the toner. Tightens pores on my nose and smooths out my skin! Love the scent of both! I think I will start recording while unboxing.  This product looked as if it was used already,  there was no seal on it and it looked like some of the product was missing.  The other product I received was sealed. My skin can breath again! Feels great after 1st use! Me ah ayudado bastante excelente lo volvería a comprar, no tienen una fragancia así q ayudada bastante love it! my skin is in great shape bc of this product Received and really enjoy it, just wish the warehouse worker wouldn't of been having a bad day. Around half of it had been squeezed out before I got it."
192,B001H54VJI,"Works perfect on my hair. I like to order in multiples. I use and depend on it all the time. I love how this rose water makes my hair feel and smell. I’ve been searching for something to keep my locs moisturized and I can say I’ve found it. Good quality product I've been using this rose water from this company for years. Excellent product, never got any problems, for sure will back with next orders. This is my favorite toner since 2000. I finish one bottle about every 3 months. I use this toner even my skin sensitive or have acne. One of the purest and effective water for slin Alright, to date I have tried many many brands and grades of rose water(at practical and impractical lashings out at my wallet). I shall not mention their names, because although they are no longer to be repurchased by myself, they still nonetheless served me well enough at some point or another. But that was exactly the problem, they merely served me WELL ENOUGH. I've always loved roses, and I've researched all of the means by which roses serve towards well being. The countless rose waters that I'd used however, always seemed to be missing something, or not quite reaching that high note I always listen for in a beauty product. My eyes stung, bad tastes, tightening drying effects, artificial scents. You name it, each and every rose water I'd tried had some faulty. I even opted to go organic; still, at bulk, the organic rose water that I almost settled upon had an unpleasant scent(almost like the smell of rotten rose water at the bottom of an empty vase abandoned sans cleansing), not to mention (and unacceptably so, being certified organic, the supposed ""purest of pure"") broke me out! The whole point of a rose water, I figure, is to relieve, relax, and tone. Not cause an uproar of stinging, unpleasantness, and upheaval of my cystic acne.I thought I'd almost given up, and accepted that nothing is complete, nothing's perfect. I was just about to repurchase the expensive, luxuriously bottled, however debatable benefits rose water, when I browsed through amazon, and spot this brand. I'd remembered dismissing this product, as I'm awfully vain and to see that this product was hideously bottled in a putrid pink, just turned me off. However, looking at the gorgeous antique and nostalgia printed useless and expensive rose water that I was currently using, I realized, I really ought not to judge a book for its cover. I had just recently purchased Heritage's Castor oil( to great quality and success) and figured, why not? You've wasted tons of money already, this is a great value, and who knows? Maybe this could be it.AND it is! The MINUTE, the SECOND that I sprayed this, my PORES just knew! It's as though they SANG out to me in delight, in applause, in saying FINALLY, darling, THIS IS THE ONE!! It fell like elixir rain drops onto my skin, and absorbed quickly enough, leaving behind a dewy, moisturized, glowing complexion. and the SCENT, goodness, DIVINE! Really, ROSES. I even sprayed so much(unnecessarily and over indulgently so!) that I got a bit in my mouth. Pure! Not a single bit of unpleasantness, I may just open the top and pour it all down my throat!(just kidding, though I may utilize it in my rose petal pound cake!) Although I was unsure of the organic status of this product, I am positive now it is pure. Whether certified or not, this is certainly higher grade than that certified brand I'd tried. And the SCENT. It is ROSES. Like the scent of a rose bush in the rain. Like the odour of petals in bath water. It is PERFECTION. My search has ended. It's what I've yearned for. Never judge a the exterior of a bottle for the value of its contents; you never know until you try. To the previous user stating it's for angels and butterflies only: this is a fact. But I believe that all women are angels and butterflies, all of us that put forth the effort towards our well being."
193,B000XPC8MA,"Now and then I like to use this mask to brighten and give the face a kick of glow to it. It really does minimize the pores and gets rid of birth control pill related acne and spots. I use it twice a week and when applied I leave it on for 1 hr. It even helps with the dry skin issues (patchy marks) and older scars. You do need to apply a face oil afterwards to seal in moisture and help boast the effects after washing out the pearl mask. It exfoliate well the skin. To help heal  the skin faster I would use in combination with germas' arnica gel to seal in the deal and help stimulate the face giving it a nice glow. A little pick mo up after the weird set of climate changes going on lately.The product has a grainy, sandy feel which smooths the skin when you scrub the face to wash the stuff out with cold water to close the pores. It has a pearl powder smell to it which means they are using the good stuff to make this product. A little goes a long way. If you have a combined  skin twice a week should be enough. However for dry skin once a week is best. This stuff  does a number on acne and scars so daily use will damage the skin more than actually help it. I had a few dark spots on the side of my cheeks and they have banished with this cream. The first thing that I would like to say about this product, and any other skin product out there, is that nothing is ever going to be a fantastically fast worker. In truth no matter what you are using, if it promises you results in 5 minutes or 5 hours, it is wrong. It will always take 4 weeks for your skin to be be effectivly influenced by anything you are putting on it, it is proven by medical science. 4 weeks. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some people who see results in a couple days, however these people don't realize that the results they are seeing are effecting what is right below the first two layers of skin. Also, you may see results within two weeks, but not a huge diffrence that most people are looking for. For most people, myself included, our problems lay deeper. Think of your skin as an onion, yes like shrek, you too have layers. The product has to go through multiple levels of skin and this does not happen over night. So you could speed this up by using something that draws impurities closer to the surface, such as Aztec Secret: Indian healing clay, otherwise you must be patient.Now, for this product, I must say that I love it. I don't use it for acne, I use it for the dark marks left behind. I've been using it for three-four weeks now and have seen very nice results. I mix it with a clean make-up brush specifically for this product, a 1$ ELF foundation brush, and apply it to the areas of my skin that need work. It has a fine gritty feel to it and an interesting smell, not harsh or bad, that I enjoy. I tend to leave it on for an hour when I wear it. I say ' when I wear it,' because in the beginning I used it Every Night for two weeks straight, though I see other reviewers say they only apply it 2 days a week. However, now a days I apply it when I remember to, which is usually three or four times a week. I put it on after I use The Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, which I tend to use every other night, and am surprised that my delicate skin never has an issue with it. That is a great sign.I then take it off with a washcloth and cold water, using soft strokes. This stuff does not dry onto your skin, which I was surprised at, but there are some little 'white out-like' chunks that fall off after a while. This means you don't have to scrub your skin to get the stuff off which would only mean more redness. Always use cold water as well, to elliminate any redness that hot water leaves behind, and make sure to rinse your washcloth right after to avoid staining. I would not say this is a bleach exactly, as I have gotten it on my eyebrows and they are as brown as ever, but it does leave white spots on your wash clothes.Afterwards, when my skin is dry, I tend to take pictures of the problem areas. I can tell you without a doubt that when I review the recent pictures with the ones taken when I first started, there is indeed a diffrence. Nothing hugely dramatic yet, as I just reached the fourth week mark, but the red spots have started to blend into my skin better and the newer acne spots have dissappeared almost entirely. My problem areas are my forehead and my right cheek, and I have noticed that I have to apply far less makeup then ever to cover those marks, which usually stand out against my pale skin. So yes, this product will help you, but if you don't see results in the first three days like some of these reviewers surprisingly do, don't fear. Remember that it takes two weeks for you to build a habit, and four for your skin to build one. I tried this when I was high school and it whitened my face and gave me a good complexion. For some reason I forgot about this product maybe since where I live now it was not available in store. Well I am now in 4th decade and so happy I found it again. I hope the formula has not changed and this stuff still works for me. I will update later. The product does not have a lot of unnecessary chemicals and the oyster shell is something you will find in much more expensive products. So hoping it still works…. I’ve been using this mask since I was in high school. I struggled with acne and it always helped to reduce redness on my skin. I still use it to this day and I cam guarantee it always leaves the face feeling soft and looking better. This works personally for me. Definitely love it been using this since I was 17 and it was clearing my little blackSpots in my face I was doing some research and came across Concha Nacar Bleach Cream #3. Before trying it I wanted to get all the information I can about this product.Over the years my face have become sensitive and quick to irritate especially from any kind of heat so I started using only natural food and products for sensitive skin. After researching Concha Nacar  I saw that all the ingredients it has I use or have used before but had to give it a second thought because of the lemon juice and papain ingredients, I didn't want the citrus to irritate my skin. After thinking hard about it I decided to give it a try.I love that it's gentle and can be use daily. I usually apply it only on my blemished areas before cleansing my face because I don't like how the product stay on after rinsing off with cold water as directed. To make sure my skin doesn't get irritated I would massage as small bit of grapeseed oil on my face before applying the cream.I allow the cream to sit for about 45 minutes on my face and the remainder 15 minutes I let the steam from the shower open my pores to get a good deep cleansing from the bentonite clay. Then I cleanse with oatmeal, honey and cinnamon. After I'm done my face feel very smooth and soft. I have noticed some of my blemishes and acne scars are getting lighter. Even though I just started using Concha Nacar Bleach Cream I would recommend this product if your looking for gentle and natural. It really is an effective product. You just have to be consistent in using it."
194,B001B1QMKO,"Soothing and moisturizing I get this for my boss every holiday and birthday that she has.  She swears by this eye cream and only this one.  She is 69 and her face looks incredible so I can't argue with its results.  I used it as well and I do like the thickness of it and I do think it would work if I used it religiously like she does.  She used it once a day she said when she first started years and years ago and now she does it twice because she feels like she is getting older.  She said she used to have a scar in between  her eyes and after using this it disappeared.Please let me know if my review helped in your decision making process one way or the other. =) Only downside to this was that there was no applicator included.  Rather challenging to use my finger due to the shape of the container. I've tried several eye creams and this one by far is the best! If your looking to reduce bags and/or wrinkles this one is a miracle cream. I'm 41 y.o. who has tried from cheap to expensive eye creams, I've had a difficult time finding one that actually works. This one was almost instant, by the 2nd day of using Estee Lauder my under eye puffiness was gone. Their is no scent, didn't leave my eyes itchy or burning in the a.m. I dab a little under each eye before bed. It's a little pricey but so worth it. I'll definitely be buying this again! I couldn't believe that this product was still sold.  Being I had used it once in my early 20s I just figured it was no longer made.  I spent a good amount of money on other stuff that didn't work until I saw this was still being made.  Same results as I had a decade ago. Within a month, the dark circles start to fade from the outer part of the under-eye.  in about a month and a half puffiness was greatly reduced.  In 2 months, I'm no longer using foundation. within 5 months I'm out and I look so good I almost forgot why I bought it(but I'm not making that mistake again).  Good results and preservation.  It does what it says. I bought it in August-2022. Already used it but today I did check expiration date what they said D98. That’s mean it made in 2018. So I used the expired one. So mad about It's a wonderful lubricant for eyes. Really softens lines around your eyes. I've used it for years. This undereye cream is really silky and goes on without tugging on the skin under my eyes--and it actually works to reduce fine lines. An excellent product!"
195,B0000C0XL8,"I use this to remove my makeup. Works but it’s not organic. I usually buy organic jojoba oil. This stuff is like GOLD to me. Its my go to product. I have dry skin like no other and as I age it becomes more and more dry like the Sahara, in come this gold elixir. It is my saving grace for winter, summer, fall, spring.... anytime. A little goes a long way and you seriously don't have to slather it on like other products that contain glycerin and alcohol. Perfect for your face, removing makeup or purely moisturizing. I use it after my shower to lock in moisture. Perfect for frizzy hair or deep conditioning. Works amazing to moisturize dry hands from washing. You can add some Vitamin E oil to thicken it up and add even more benefit. A little background on my skin type. I’m 36 years old and have combination skin that is extremely sensitive and very acne prone (mix of hormonal acne and other sorts). My finicky skin causes me a lot of heartache and has resulted in many tears. For years I have been avoiding any type of moisturizers out of fear i’d break out. Instead, i was using face products geared towards “acne” and clear skin which in turn made my sensitive skin even worse. After much research I finally pulled the trigger and decided to try out the oil cleansing method (sans coconut oil because that stuff is HIGH on the comedogenic scale at a 5). Instead, i tried jojoba which is only 2 on comedogenic scale (so not completely pore clogging free) but it has a composition closest to that of human sebum so it works.My thoughts. I have found a new holy grail! This stuff has completely helped my red and irritated skin to calm down. I will sometimes mix this with Argan or hemp oil (both 0 on comedogenic scale meaning it will not clog pores) and oil cleanse with that. After oil cleansing i will wash my face with an oil free cleanser of some sort (or miceller water) and then finish off with a little more oil which I pat into my skin and leave on overnight. I will rotate between jojoba and Argan or hemp depending on how dry my skin feels due to weather. Instead of waking up with an oily face, i wake up with a glowing non oily complexion. It’s amazing.Tip. There is no such thing as “skin purging” so if you try this and it is causing additional breakouts then it is not the right oil for your skin type. If that happens, try Argan or hemp to see how one of those works. Everyone has a different skin composition so it’s possible that although this works for me, it may not work for you. If it doesn’t work on your face though, use it on your cuticles and body because it will surely leave you with soft healthy skin!! I started using this based on the the reviews on a popular makeup/skincare board.  I am in my mid 30s and still struggle with occasional acne and clogged pores, yet my skin has been dry and I am beginning to get some fine lines.  Based on my history of pretty severe acne breakouts in my 20's and sensitivity to a variety of popular skincare products, including most sunscreens, moisturizers and makeup, I never considered putting oil on my face; not in a million years would I have tried this before I began my research.  Recently my skin has been somewhat dehydrated and I had started occasionally using Retin A Micro to unclog my pores and relieve myself of some stubborn blackheads.  My skin was unable to handle this routine, but every night cream and heavy moisturizer I tried either wasn't hydrating enough or reclogged my pores.  I read online some reviews of buffering the Retin A Micro with oils, and how Jojoba oil can intensify moistuizers without being harsh on acne prone skin.  I am so glad I tried this.  I now use it every morning and every night and massage into my skin very liberally.  I still use the Retin A Micro about three nights a week right on top of this and I don't get the redness and peeling that I did before.  No clogged pores or acne.  I will say that my 14 year old daughter has great skin but tends to be dry with excema.  She had started peeling from too many acne products.  I used this on her skin once, and it looked great unti the next day.  She broke out in 3 huge pimples in areas she normally does not get acne.  I can only assume this product was the issue since nothing else changed in her routine.  Bottom line is maybe try the product in a limited area before using it daily, just to ensure it won't cause a reaction.  My bottle does have an official ""Organic"" seal on the manufacturer label.  I ordered the 4 fl oz. Yo, this stuff is a god send. I had been experiencing what I like to call Macne (acne caused by wearing a face mask). Had clear skin all my life and all of a sudden after returning to work after quarantine I started to break out on my cheeks. I tried multiple products trying to fight it off but nothing seemed to work. Summer 2021 a good friend of mine gave me HALF a bottle of this to try. Within like 2 weeks of using it once a day I noticed an improvement. I’ve been using it ever since. 9 months in and I just now need a new bottle! I little bit goes a long way! It’s super light, scent less and you can use it on your hair too! Seriously, buy it."
196,B000NT2EE8,"So I only got this yesterday and it might be a little premature for me to already leave feedback but due to the results I couldn't help myself!!I have random bouts of break outs on my face, but I have a constant line of acne along my hairline on my forehead. Well, with just two uses yesterday and one this morning, they have already started disappearing! I am so ecstatic it isn't even funny! I have used sooo many different products to try and fight that and the random break outs that pop out on my face and this is the first time I have noticed a huge difference in such a short amount of time.Not only that but I can FEEL this face wash working. It makes my skin feel tight as well which is a bonus. AND there are no perfumes.I can not wait to see what the results are in another week and I will try to add on to this review when I know the results. My fiance is also using it so I will get his opinion on it as well. I am pretty darn sure I will be recommending this to friends and family. :)Edit: It's only been three days since I started using the product and it just continues to impress me. I wash my face in the morning and before bed. Already my pores have shrunk to half their size, my skin is smooth and even, and the ""about to break surface"" acne bumps have disappeared. AND, as I mentioned the hairline acne before, there are only about 10 left before they have completely disappeared. I have tried so many other products and none have amazed me like this one has. I do hope that whoever buys this product it works just as good for them as it does for me!!Update: October 5th, 2015This stuff really did great for my face and I still use it when I am not using my other face wash (which is much stronger). My hubby definitely prefers this stuff and I need to order more. It really is gentle on the skin and helps keep breakouts down. It might not be a miracle cure for everyone, but it seems to work really good for me. Especially in comparison to a ton of other facewashes I have used. I have very bad combination skin. My T-zone is exceedingly oily but the rest of my face dries out and flakes very easily. This cleanser is mild enough to leave my entire face soft, but still clean the oily skin.  Most others I've used, like St Ives and Clean and Clear, my nose and forehead are completely oily again after about an hour. With this one, I can get about five hours before I need to blot my face.Long story short: Works much better than anything I've used yet, but still doesn't keep my face completely oil-free all day long. This stuff is amazing for my skin, I am so glad I tried it! I've used acne solutions before from other brands and their tea tree oil and salicylic acid formulas were just too drying. So I stopped trying with those for a long time and instead used salicylic and benzoyl peroxide creams that you put on your face after washing. Again.. too drying to really be a regular part of my regimen.THIS however, is so gentle but so amazingly good at cleansing. Didn't really expect much out of it but about 2-3 wks later noticed that I wasn't getting my usual acne anymore, and the blackheads on my nose that have been there forever had disappeared, and the acne marks have lightened considerably, and my skin was just softer and less wrinkly and more glowing in general! I mean, duh... this is salicylic acid so therefore it is a type of exfoliation thus sloughing off layers of old skin cells causing blockages. With this kind of chemical exfoliation I never will need to do mechanical exfoliations any more (think face scrubs of all sorts) which I think are inherently more damaging, and when done the wrong way typically produce random very small cuts or abrasions on the skin which can then get infected and form a pimple which is what you're trying to avoid in the first place.I also use some very effective but gentle moisturization products (one is cheap, one semi expensive and not found on Amazon) the former of which I plan to review separately.Anyway, I know everybody's skin is different, but I hope you go ahead and try this and see if it could work as well as it does for me. I have problems with acne and someone told me to try a PH Balanced face wash. I researched this brand and decided to try it. It has worked well! It hasn't COMPLETELY ridden my skin of blemishes, but it has certainly helped!It doesn't dry my skin out and leave it tight feeling like some other products that I have used. My skin has definitely improved. I will continue to purchase this product. Born at the tail end of the baby boom, I used Phisoderm as a child.Recently, Phisoderm was recommended to me when I asked around for a new cleanser.  My skin began reacting to my old cleanser  which was an exfoliator with 2% salicylic acid. Because of the recommendation and my positive childhood memories, I decided to give Phisoderm a try.I checked several stores and did not see Phisoderm. Finally at my 4th stop, I asked an employee.  She walked me to the aisle and showed me a bottle. It never occurred to me something might be different.I looked for a grass green colored bottle.  The new packaging is mint green.I looked for a big P with bold black writing.The new writing has more attractive fonts with softer colors.Also, it dispenses with a pump.Since that day, I have been using Phisoderm as recommended which is twice daily.  My break-outs stopped immediately.Phisoderm cleanses and softens my skin without a lot of gel.My cheekbone skin is sensitive. Subsequently, I do feel some tingling and drying. But, not enough to stop using.I would recommend Phisoderm to anyone who wants a reasonably priced over the counter cleanser that does not exfoliate, is not overly fragrant and has the highest level of salicylic acid without a prescription."
197,B001ET77YI,"Okay, so let me start by saying that I saw Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Liquid Soap listed as a TOP 10 product in GQ Magazine, and I was skeptical. I mean, how good could soap really be, right?But let me tell you, this soap is like an angel blowing an ice cube all over my body. It's like a refreshing wake-up call every time I use it. And the best part is, it's made with all-natural ingredients. So I don't have to worry about slathering myself with a bunch of fake chemical body wash that's probably doing more harm than good.I'm pretty sure this soap is the reason I haven't gotten sick in like, forever. It's like a miracle in a bottle. And let me tell you, I will never buy another cheap, fake, chemical-laden body wash again.So thank you, Dr. Bronner's, for introducing this soap into my life. I literally thank God every day that I found it. If you want a refreshing, all-natural soap that will make you feel like you're being hugged by an angel, this is the soap for you. Trust me, your body (and your soul) will thank you. Keeps me fresh longer than others. Dilute your soap! Lol. It’s not being cheap, it’s literally using it how its intended to be used. It actually helps you out in having the product longer. All that to say, i love this soap. Peppermint is one of its strongest ones but still a great product. This to me, is the best scent they offer. Its total body refreshment and smells nice while in the shower. Combined with the steam from a hot shower, seems to help my sinuses as well El jabón es muy bueno , pero esta ves llego abierto el embalaje y todo el liquido se vertió en el embalaje ,  quisiera que me envíen otro producto .. Gracias Can definitely dry your skin out. I use it every other bath time. This soap works exactly like I need it to do….clean and moisturize at the same time. Your body will feel rejuvenated, fresh and clean."
198,B001ET77NY,"Love it for showering and also mix it in with my homemade laundry detergent!!! I like this brand a lot and the soap smells nice. It dries out my skin though. Dr. Bronners soap is good. Lots of moisture. The Citrus (my favorite) smells great and so does the Peppermint. I would say they all smell great! Cleans very well and smells so nice. It's soap! Add water, it gets soapy! It smells like oranges, but it's actually white. I use it, I get clean, and smell like oranges. Win win. I switched to this soap a few years ago and will never use anything else. I used to have redness on my chest (mild acne) and after using this soap for a few months, it left and never came back.This stuff smells great (but not overwhelming), feels good on the skin, and does not make body hair sticky like some bar soaps do. I can only speak to my skin and experience, but I'd say give it a shot if you have any body acne. It's a little pricey, but worth it in my opinion. Have ordered this item several times. Each bar lasts a long time. On the expensive side but worth it I've been a fan of Dr. Bronner's soaps for over 30 years. While I have usually preferred the liquid versions of it, I am finding that the bar versions are just as rich and lovely to use while being cost-effective too. I use this soap for my face and my body and my skin is clear, nourished and moisturized without build-up. It's so good that I may even try using it as a shampoo bar at some point."
199,B001CN3QKK,"I wish they had an extra moisturizing tanning lotion the exact same kind - other than that, we ordered a second bottle and the quality of the tan had us ready for Jamaica! I use this occasionally and love it.It works.Smells wonderful.Helps keep your skin soft. I will get this product again. It is working well Works well and smells great Tanning at pool, used this product for several years, like it alot Works good in the tanning bed on a level 2 or higher and has a pleasant scent that’s not overwhelming. I use it after showering every day!! I have been a suntanning ""addict"", ""pro"" or ""goer"" for over 40 years.....from a home tanning bulb that looked like the old bulbs that kept french fries warm at fast food places to, when you went in a booth that was covered with metallic material and FOUR bulbs...then came the tanning beds that did not have a canopy but only the bed where you had to flip over to tan both sides....Yes, younger folks we had these contraptions 40+ plus years ago.  Not to mention outdoor tanning where you would lie on a metallic ""blanket"" called Even Up to tan your sides and have a metallic item held under your chin to tan your neck....So as you can deduce, I have done it all.  George Hamilton does not have as much UV as I.  The Accelerators came in the very early 1980s and were full of Tyrosine (amino acid, look it up).  Honestly, I feel the accelerators are nice moisturizers and typically smell nice, but as far as forcing the skin to tan only one containing a ""psoralen"" (look this up as well, can be dangerous) would create a situation where the melanocytes are stimulated to tan the skin.  All of this about "" medium lever beds"" and "" super beds""....it is really about he amount of UVA and UVB that is concentrated.  You need a small amount of UVB to stimulate the tanning process and the UVA typically ""bronzes"" this stimulated melanin.  This lotion I have used for a while, even when they offered an outdoor spray that was a very similar aroma and had a small amount of sun filter (sunscreen).  It does a nice job of moisturizing.  I am not sure it accelerates the process.  Ashy skin is much like a glass (or glass soft drink bottle) that has become hazed...if you add oil to that surface the haze tends to go away.  So if your skin is dry and you add moisture, you will look more suntanned.  Believe me, I have done it all, tried everything imaginable...if you want more info reach me at Sakowitz50@gmail.com  PS, ""tingle lotions"" do nothing but make you irritated and red.  The do NOT do anything more...I promise you on this."
200,B000ILKUHY,"Product is great, I have used it before.  Packaging was awful.  The bottle was packaged in shrink wrap that was so tight that it  caused the pump on the bottle to be pushed down in a way that caused the soap to leak out of the bottle.  So a good portion of the product was missing.  Fortunately the bag was sealed enough that none of the soap leaked into the shipping box. A very smooth lotion which is very easily absorbed into the skin. Added bonus a very pleasing delicate scent and great sun protection to boot. I use albas face wash and was commited to another brand for moisturizing. They out of stock so i jumped ship and bought albas brand. I figured it would work and it does, but whats with the packaging? The lid is hard to pull off and the dispenser isn’t work so i have to remove the lid and dispense then squeeze the tube. Is this normal?? This left my face soft and clean.  The smell is light and smells clean but once washed off, it  doesn’t linger.  This foams really well.  Super happy with this product!! I am a man and I suffer from cystic acne. For the last couple months, I have been on an antibiotic regimine for this which has helped tremendously but also causes me to have very dry skin and be susceptible to sun burn. So I decied to get some moisturizer with SPF. I tried a couple other brands, most were either too thick or had an awful smell(chemically). This smells really fresh with little hints of ocean smell. It also makes my skin immediately feel cool and refresshed. It IS to be used SPARINGLY though. If you add too much, it will feel thick and slimy. Usually running a rag over my face lightly fixes that, but I am now more careful not to overapply it. Start with just a little dot and spread it between your fingers and cover your entire face in circular motions.For me it has helped balance the complexion of my face more, but I will say that it's not some miracle cream. I don't really care about it, but I have circles under my eyes which using this daily for two months has not helped--maybe it will in the future though. Never had a sun-burn while wearing it either. Good stuff! I've used the previous version of this moisturizer for a while and have liked it. The first time I bought this new kind, the pump didn't come with all of its parts and nothing comes out when I pump, so it's barely usable. Disappointing. I have previously purchased the mask on the same line and already knew I liked the smell and the results on my skin. My skin is pretty clear as is, but I wanted to move away from using my body soap (typically black soap or castile) on my face, so I looked around at other natural options and eventually landed on this. I've only used it for just under a week, but I felt a difference almost immediately, with  my skin feeling softer and more hydrated, and more even. A little goes a long way, so it's unclear right now just how long this small bottle will last, perhaps 2 to 4 months? The pump works well, too.Update June 24, 2016Okay! So I still enjoy the smell of this product and feel that it is pretty creamy, but I actually stopped using it on my face a couple months ago. It just seemed that my pores were getting clogged, which is unusual for me given that I tend to have naturally clear, dry skin. I guess I do better with gentle, clarifying cleansers, so I've been back to my black, castile soap. I still the Even Advanced as a shave cream because it feels so rich, and I may return to occasional use when winter rolls around again... i have crazy crazy sensitive skin, and after using this product for a month i went ahead and ordered a second bottle. i used cetaphil for years but never saw an improvement in my skin, but the difference in the months i've used this product is super clear. my skin just feels so clean and fresh after using it, especially compared to cetaphil. bonus points because its one of the few gentle facewashes that actually smells nice. because of this product i'm a huge alba  botanica fan :)"
201,B000EEX7TI,"Foaming hand soap with green tea and aloe is a type of hand soap that is formulated to clean and moisturize the skin. The green tea and aloe ingredients are known for their skin-soothing and hydrating properties, and can help to leave hands feeling soft and refreshed after washing. Foaming hand soap is a type of liquid soap that is dispensed from a pump bottle as a light, airy foam. This type of soap is designed to lather well and provide a gentle, yet effective clean. The green tea and aloe foaming hand soap may have a pleasant, fresh scent, and be free of harsh chemicals and irritants, making it suitable for frequent use. This is a great scent, I use it all the time. I am quite disappointed at the design of the product because there always is a good amount that can't be squirted out. Maybe a different design? It has a very strong tea smell. It could be a bit softer. I plan to add lemon essential oils to soften the smell. Great foam hand soap. Love the lightness and mild tea scent. I love the method soaps and buy them by the case.  Two annoyances though, one is when I receive a box of six they are a tangled mess in the box and sometimes even leaking.  I don't quite know why they aren't including at least a flimsy cardboard separator inside the case to keep the bottles upright during shipping.  Second problem is more annoying, the pump starts to stick and stay down when I dispense the soap, I end up having to pull it up constantly.  They really should look for a way to make this dispenser work more reliably.  These bottles aren't even being refilled and it sticks, I could see having a problem if you've been refilling it for months but that's not what I'm doing.  If you do try to refill them it's almost a sure thing you'll have problems with the dispenser sticking after that many uses. I position this soap at every sink…more gentle on hands than most soaps. Great smell, easy pumping, great value for the money What can I say. It foams, it cleans, and it smells good."
202,B0010H93A0,"It will give you color, if you like that orange tint to it. Does definitely stain hands and in between fingers even after washing hands thoroughly. This is the best tanning lotion for the inside bed that I ever used. Color is great just use wipes to clean your hands before climbing in. The bottle looks cool but falls over easy. I love this product for it's gradual tan boost after applying it before the tanning  bed. Because the ""built-in"" darkeners, don't fully show until a few hours after your tan, Streaking happens without even coverage. I've been buying this since high school...I graduated in 2001...and it was a lot larger!! It still smells like citrus when you put it on and still has strong after tan odor when you wear it. It still stains your hands and books and crannies orange because bit has DHA in it. It's still a great moisturizer if you use it just for that and like a gradual Tanner without the tanning bed, it'll tan you.  So over all, it's the same but inflation has changed the size, but not the price. As with most things. Would I buy it again? Sure, but not as my go to. Not to use daily. It's my alternative lotion when I need a boost after a plateau. Worth the inflation price for that but I only buy once every five to ten years. The REAL lotion from Supre is amazing...HOWEVER, this is NOT THAT LOTION!!!! it's supposed to be white.. mine was beige! Is supposed to smell fruity (reminds me of fruity pebbles!) BUT this one smelled like pure at home Jergans sunless tanner! HORRIBLE! was greasy and itchy! SPEND THE MONEY TO GET THE REALLLLL SMOKE BY SUPRE... this was definitely an at-home mixture they are selling. This is an amazing product. Better than any I have ever tried and I have been tanning for a long time. Remember to wash your hands after you apply it bc it does have a self tanner in there as well I bought this lotion in may of this year from amazon. Product came in 2 days because I have amazon prime. The lotion does make you much darker, possibly the darkest I have been (I have tanned in a tanning bed for 4 years now). The drawbacks of this product are that:1: it didn't make me my natural brown tan color that I usually get with the tanning bed. I was a bit oranger than usual but not anything that made me look like a pumpkin. My step-mom just noticed that I was a different type of tan than I normally am.2: When I went swimming this summer, the parts of my body that rubbed together like the creases of my arm and armpits as well as the area around my belly ring rubbed off and left the areas white while the rest of my body was a considerable amount darker.3. The smell of this lotion is quite bad after tanning, but that's really to be expected with any tanning lotion.I would possibly buy this again maybe for the winter, but for the summer, as I swim a lot, I would not want my tan to rub off just because I stayed wet for 45 minutes at a time. Love this tanning lotion! It was my favorite when I worked at a tanning salon. Not too much bronzer to stain and give you falsehood that you're actually tanning. Smells DELICOUS even after your session, which is rare. Amazing price for an amazing product!"
203,B000VEN3RW,"Feels good and has great ingredients in it but it is not a necessary step after peeling.  I use it after I peel each time.  I neutralize the peel with lots of rinsing with water.  Then I apply this and keep it on for about 20 minutes (because of the awesome ingredients), then I rinse it off and continue with my serums and moisturizers.  The willow in this product is an awesome anti-inflamitory!!!!  That's really why I leave it on for 20 minutes.  And because it just feels good.Minus 1 star for the price and the fact that it is not necessary in the peeling process...and they sell it as a necessary step.  So I guess it's minus one star for price and false advertising?It is great stuff!  I love it and my skin does too!!!  You don't need a neutralizer after you peel!! Water works perfectly!!  Best wishes!!! Before I bought this product, I would have a bi-weekly peels. Since my skin is fairly thick, I would administer onto my face using 50-70% Glycolic Acid to get the optimum effect. The sensation it would leave behind is unbearable, even when rinsed in cold water. I finally did some research online on ways to minimize the lingering effect of chemical peels and stumbled onto this neutralizer. Like any skeptic customer, I was quite hesitant on the seller's claim: ""helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe effective neutralization after peeling."" Adding to the skepticism, I was reading a few of the other reviewer's posts to see if their anguish and experience were relate-able. Pretty convincing stuff, but some reviewers gave me that iffy feeling considering they only have one or two reviews in their profile.After so many days contemplating, I realized that it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. I'm glad I made the decision to purchase this product.From experience, this product not only has a soothing effect, but it helps offset any traces of acid left in your face. Also, this saves you time during the healing process. I find this a definite plus since I hate being cooped up in the house for days. For me, the longest I ever had to wait before interacting with people was a day without them noticing. But normally, my face would return to its original color within several hours. Just with the Glycolic Acid alone would have left my face noticeably scorched for 2-3 days -- similar case when Samantha from 'Sex and the City' consulted with her dermatologist and tried a chemical peel; idk if you've seen that episode, but that's the best illustrated reference I can think of.If you are fairly new to this experience, I highly suggest applying during the weekend; allow your skin to heal before returning to work or direct contact with people. Remember to apply with UV moisturizer liberally to avoid scarring and speed the healing process. I love this stuff!  First time using a peel at home- I ordered this stuff for another peel I bought and this came with a 35% glycolic and lactic acid peel as a sample.  I thought why not???  I am 42 with RESISTANT skin- meaning, my skin doesn't respond quickly to skin care products.  I usedthe peel it came with this twice in the first week - yes, twice.  First time was the evening it arrived.  A quick swipe with a synthetic fan brush for 2 minutes in a very even manner.  Set the timer and then I rinsed and followed with the neutralizer.  I didn't put the neutralizer on directly as I knew that you have to rinse the product off your skin.  I put on sweet almond oil and Argan oil after.  The. Ext morning, my skin was much brighter and my smilelines were softer. 2 days later, I did the peel, this time extending the timer to 5 minutes.  On both time, I did not feel burning- more like a minty feel and some tingling and itching in the corners of my jawline and nose.  I avoided the eye area, but did put more in between my brows to try to soften my wrinkles there.  Rinsed again and the put on the neutralizer.  My skin feels amazing!  I will be repeating this process in about 2-3 weeks and can't wait to see the results!  I will also try with the other peel I bought at a later time.  Think this product is a great soother!  Even for sunburn.  Smells nice, lightweight, texture is smooth and doesn't react to skincare stuff. I purchased this Neutralizer for the sole purpose of using AFTER a 20% Salicylic Acid Peel. I could not be happier with the way it soothes and calms my skin after a peel. Some neutralizers can cause breakouts because they are too heavy-I can honestly say I have had no issues with breakouts brought on by this product. It splashes very clear and clean, while clearing the residue from the peel.The downside is I find I have to use a lot of it-more so than other neutralizers. Additionally-I do not see a use for it other than using after a peel, where as some neutralizers double as a cleansing water.I would recommend this to anyone that needs a neutralizer after a peel-but other than that I do not think there is much use for it.Skin type: 20-something, acne-prone, sensitive, semi-pigmented, pale, few-lines I  BOUGHT  THIS  PRODUCT  ABOUT  A  WEEK  AGO,  AND  I  ABSOLUTELY  LOVE  IT  !  THIS  BIG  BOTTLE  IS  FABULOUS  AND  DOES  COOL  YOUR  PAIN  DOWN  ALOT  ,  AND  IF  YOU  DO EXPERIENCE  A  CHEMICAL  PEEL,  AS  I  DID  NOT  AS  YET  DO ONE,  BUT  I  DID  EXPERIENCE  SOME  BURNING  AFTER  SKIN  BEGAN  PEELING  ON  MY  FACE  AFTER  3  DAYS  AFTER  USING  TRETONIC  A,  THAT  IS  SOME  POWERFUL  STUFF,  AND  YOUR  SKIN  WILL  BEGAN  TO  PEEL,  SO  THIS  HELPED  ME  TO  SURVIVE ,  HA HA .  WHATEVER  IS  IN  CELLBONE  TECHNOLOGY,  ITS  VERY  GOOD.  EXCELLENT,  AND  THEY  GAVE  ME  A  FREE  SAMPLE  OF  35 %  GLYCOLIC,  THAT  WAS  A  NICE  GESTURE  BY  THEM,  SMILE,  THANK  YOU  CELLBONE.  WORTH  EVERY  PENNY."
204,B001FB5IIM,"I have used this for 30 years My one-product go to.  Great for face, body and hair. I've been using this since I was a kid. I have relatively sensitive skin. This is the only thing that keeps me blemish free and moisturized.  Getting harder to find in stores. So thankful to find it here! My husband loves this face wash and he convinced me to try it.  Before using Basis I had tried dozens of cleansers over the years including many expensive ones from department stores and day spas.  I must admit, this cleanser works just as well if not better than the pricey ones.  It cleans well and rinses off easily without drying my skin.  It has a very nice smell that is gender neutral--not too floral or feminine, and not too masculine either (such as pine or musk).  The manufacturer says it has mint, chamomile, and lemongrass, but I would say that none of those smells dominate.  Instead, they combine to create a unique smell that is slightly citrus, light, and fresh without smelling chemical or artificial.Other ""pros"": it does not irritate my sensitive skin.  No greasy residue.  Takes off make-up well.  Tube design has no flaws and sits upright without leaking or becoming messy.  It has a good gel-like consistency that lathers and spreads well, so a little goes a long way.  I hate cleansers that are too thin/watery because you end up using more and ultimately spending more.  A tube of Basis lasts a long time--a few months.  And I like sharing the same cleanser with my husband because it reduces the clutter in the shower.""Cons"": not many stores stock it (and we are in a major metro area), meaning you must plan ahead and stock up when you see it or buy ahead online to avoid running out.  Also it does not exfoliate so I use a separate product for weekly exfoliating to get rid of dead skin cells (which is important for skin to look its best).  I also cannot say how it works on acne because I have not suffered from that since my teenage years (thankfully!)Summary: a very good basic skin cleanser for men and women at an affordable price. I have been using this cleanser for a few months now, and I have only positive things to say about it (though I will try to critique it fairly for helpful feedback). I'll start off by saying that I have relatively dry skin save for a sometimes oily T-zone. I usually don't break out and when I do it's right before my period.The smell is absolutely wonderful and light, so for anyone bothered by fragrance this should be okay. It doesn't have a strong smell, and even then you can only smell it while applying it. The scent it does have is clean.After using it, my face doesn't feel dry like it usually does after cleansing it. I still moisturize it (with Lancome Bienfait Multivital for those interested), but immediately after washing it still feels normal. Normally, cleansers leave my face feeling tight.I use the cleanser daily and despite having used it for just over 2 months, I still haven't run out! I use it once a day and you only need a tiny amount in order to get the right amount for your face.It completely removes my makeup, which I love, and it even claims to remove pollution! I say claims because there is no way for me to test this out, of course :p Oh, and as with all other cleansers, it doesn't remove eye makeup like mascara or eye liner.Although I had never had problem skin, since using this product my skin is the clearest it has ever been. Even my pre-menstrual breakouts seem to be better. In case this is conditional, my current skin care routine only involves using this and the aforementioned moisturizer.Things about my lifestyle that may affect how this works for me: I'm 20 years old, I exercise on a regular basis, and I stay away from fast food. I've used this product for years. Cleans well, yet non-drying. Great for sensitive skin. I have used this facial cleanser since college when it was included in a welcome pack. As a side note I don't remember how I received it that year because I wasn't living on campus, but so very grateful I did! In any case, I used to switch around between several brands; Biore, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Olay, to name a few. I'm 35 now and have received innumerable compliments on my skin. I often get mistaken for being 10+ years younger, but I also attribute that to my Bare Minerals make-up. I have combination skin; my chin, eye and cheek areas tend to be dry and my nose and forehead tend to be oily. This is BY FAR a superior clean. It foams nicely and removes make-up, even heavy eye make-up, with ease. When I rinse it off it doesn't make my face feel tight because it stripped all the moisture from it or filmy like it didn't all rinse off. It has a very light scent that is pleasant and unobtrusive. My favorite part about this cleanser is that I can suds up my face real good, even on my eyes, and open my eyes WITH THE CLEANSER ON THEM and it doesn't hurt or burn, not even a little bit, so it's extremely gentle as well. When stores within a 100 mile radius from me stopped selling this wonderful product I think I tried everything in this price range and even more than double this range and I couldn't find anything that held a candle to it. So glad to have found it online!! My husband purchased this four pack of Basis face wash. Prior to using it, I was using Murad Anti-Aging Acne wash (which costs about the same for one bottle).  I started using this, and while nothing is instant, within two weeks, my skin had adjusted to the simple and natural formula.  It would clean my skin, without causing it to be extra tight like some face washes can do.  It calmed the redness that I sometimes get around my chin and nose.  One tube lasts for a very long time.  You really don't have to use much at all, as it foams up very nicely.  And the tube packaging makes it easy to toss in my gym bag without fear that it will leak like a pump sometimes does.  A few weeks later, when I followed up with my dermatologist and he asked what I was using, I told him how great Basis was working for me.  He told me that he used to recommend it all the time, that it's a great face wash, but sometimes can be a challenge to find.  Thanks to amazon, I don't have to worry about that anymore."
205,B0000ZHOEU,"I suffer from skin allergies that are extremely painful. This product is a wonder! I feel so much better!  I recently had allergy testing done and I’m allergic to something called Balsam of Peru - which I’d never heard of before. It’s in many, many soaps and it’s the culprit. My allergist suggested this product and it’s wonderful!  So happy! After a few weeks of regular use, my dry, cracking, peeling, and blistered hands are back to normal. My eczema was so bad my fingertips were peeling off. I switched up all my products but I think this was the key. I love the pump, it's just slightly firmer than typical soap pumps which helps me use only the amount I need. Just wish the bottle was a little cuter! I like the fragrance free aspect of this product. It cleans well and has a short dispenser pump so don’t use too much soap.  It is a little expensive but other products I’ve tried are not fragrance free, which is a must for allergies. Vanicream is known for it's quality, inexpensive cleansers and this one does not disappoint. The lather on this is fantastic and it leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. I have really bad eczema on my hands and I'm always looking for hand soap that doesn't make my eczema works. This one is okay, it definitely washes your hands, but the price is a bit much for the small container. I've purchased this several times. My dermatologist gave me samples of this and the lite lotion YEARS ago. I haven't stopped using it since. Doesn't dry your skin and the lotion hydrates with the right balance, not too heavy and no clogged pores. Vanicream liquid cleanser is really gentle in your skin. It doesn’t dry it out, leaving it nice and soft. I like that there is no scent.  I have Rosacea so this is a great product for those of you with sensitive skin. My dermatologist hadsuggested that I try this product. This cleanser is great! Use the 32 oz. to refill small pump bottles. Great for showers and washing your face as well as at the sinks to wash hands. No smell and cleans well without stripping your skin. Highly recommended. Great seller. Packaged very well. Decent delivery time."
206,B00006FRW7,"At 58, it's not fair that I have wrinkles, but am also prone to breakouts! This is the only moisturizer I can use that will (most of the time) prevent breakouts. I put it on after every time I wash my face. Works well my face is usually dry around my mouth and nose area and I have acne but this evens everything out and my face is not dry I’ve been using this moisturizer for years and almost freaked out when I noticed the rebranding and couldn’t find it anywhere. My skin does not like anything else doesn’t matter how expensive products are. Aveeno positively radiant will never disappoint. Amazon seem to be the only place I can find it these days. ❤️❤️ ""Aveeno Clear Complexion Salicylic Acid Acne-Fighting Daily Moisturizer""- This is an excellent moisturizer for acne prone, sensitive skin. It works well but does not dry your skin. Shipping was fast and price is reasonable for such a good product. Have been using this for about the past 3-4 years and I really like it. I have very sensitive skin. Love aveeno hope to keep buying it does say may cause dryness? It's a moisturizer!? Works very well to keep away acne however it works best at nights for a country with a hotter  climate. I live in the Caribbean so I use it at nights I thought I was the only one but I’m not. I’ve been using this moisturizer for years but just like others have commented on here, ever since they changed the formula I don’t like it as much and I am disappointed now but I don’t know if I will be able to find anything else which irritates me as well."
207,B000MXHG66,"This is the best dark spot remover  I have found and I have tried many!  It starts working from day one and keeps until the spots have faded by 1/2.  It does not totally remove them , so far I have not found anything short of a laser that totally removes them.  Would purchase again. I have numerous scars from Impetago , as well as dark blotches from two pregnancies, on my face. Nothing I tried worked. Mainly, they just made me break out or gave me contact dermatitis. I read about this in a magazine and figured  it was only @10.00, so what the heck. This stuff really works and does not irritate my skin. It takes a while, but it works better and faster than anything else I have ever tried. this product works  slowly, this is the best one I have come - i alternate days with reviva brown spot gel.  I only wish there was a product that works in a month, not over years to make brown spots disapear It turns out that this product has carcinogenic ingredients that are banned in some countries. How do I get a refund? I Get this for my husband. He works outside in the sun and gets sun spots on his cheeks. This product really makes a difference. Does it remove them all- no, but most and he likes how it moisturizes because he also has really dry skin. I've even bought him the Clinique new brown spot corrector he didn't like it as much. so get this and the Reviva lightning day face cream which he uses together with this. It is not a cure for but it does help lighten melasma. Works wonders! bought this for my Sister, I have not heard anything back from her.  I think they are waiting to see the results of the product to early to say."
208,B000HGMU0K,"We've been using this product for months now. My family has very sensitive skin issues and this is the only soap that works for all of us. No irritations, doesn't dry is out. Such a game changer for people with skin issues. Really good Vitamin soap. I've been using for 2 years. This soap leaves no film, itch or perfume smell I've used this soap for years! So glad Amazon carries it! It became impossible to find on store shelves. My face feels so clean and prepped for y lotions and potions. You would be hard pressed to talk me into anything else! I have medically dehydrated skin - much worse than what people call ""dry skin."" This is the gentlest, softest, smoothest, sweetest soap I've ever used on my face. Now that I've found it, I will buy no other. Smells good.  Feels good. Non-irritating, non-drying.  Lathers sufficiently I’m very happy with this soap. I did some research and chose to try this one and I really like it. It lathers well and rinses clean very quickly. Basis is a great non alergenic soap. We have used it for years. My dermatologist recommended this soap decades ago.  I used it for years and then could not find it in the stores anymore.  My 6 bars arrived today!  I am so happy to have it in my soap dish again!  Thank you, Amazon!"
209,B000851N9E,"Due to health concerns and some advice from a healthcare-affiliated friend, my family has joined the non-nano zinc, topical/physical sunscreen ranks. We have been avid sunscreen users for years but have recently become more ingredient conscious and health-smart; looking for products with few, natural ingredients that perform as/better than chemical stews. The larger zinc particles in physical, non-nano sunscreens cannot be absorbed through the skin so they don't make their way into blood, organs, and tissues.We just returned from a week at a mid-Atlantic beach- sunny all day, every day. We brought three non-nano products with us.  The batch we made at home with a few simple ingredients performed well and was very cost-effective, but it was greasy and sticky and all-around unpleasant on the skin.  A competitor to the BurnOut product performed well, too, but cost about $1.50 more per ounce and left more residual white-film. For four out of the six beach days, we used the BurnOut physical sunscreen on our fair-skinned 12 year-old and even after 2-3 hours in sand and water; reapply then 2-3 more hours-  no burn; not even a hint of pink.  Generally, after a week in the sun, he looks like an art project gone awry or a box of Neopolitan ice cream-  a little pink, a little brown and  a little white here, there and everywhere. The only problem occurred under his eyes where he incessantly rubbed the salt water (and sunscreen away) while playing in the water. This is a topical sunscreen so it will rub off, but the water and general sand contact did not affect performance in the least.  Hands down, it stayed on better than the other (homemade and competitor) products.  After the first day, we used a little bit of traditional (absorption) SPF 15 on his nose and cheeks, then topped it with the BurnOut product. Problem solved- no rosey cheeks.A couple of notes:1. If you are not familiar with non-nano products, do your homework and understand the benefits that equal the seemingly high-cost.2. This stuff is thick and pasty (like all non-nano zinc products) but it you apply it correctly and evenly, the ghastly hue quickly fades and a little bit of product goes A LONG WAY.3. There are several similar products available through Amazon and the marketplace, but the BurnOut product seemed to be best value (quantity and performance per dollar) when I purchased.4. Others reported trouble with skin sensitivities. My wife and son have sensitivities to just about anything but water, and nothing in the BurnOut product presented any difficulty (of course, physiology is individually unique, so not a broad-spectrum claim, just a two-outta-two thumbs up).5. We are ""regular"" people.  We love nature but DO NOT make a habit of hugging trees. We eat meat, use soap and sometimes wear polyester. The Burnout Sunscreen was a healthy step-forward in our family's ability to enjoy the sun and sand. VERY PLEASED, and next summer, we will have nothing but BurnOut in the beach bag.******* UPDATE, June 29, 2016-  True to my statement LAST summer, my family carries/uses nothing but BurnOut now.  We have been using it for just about a year-  on and off ball fields, on beach trips, hiking, camping, yard work... I am still singing its praises.  A real test--- My wife, who gets burned after three minutes of sitting too closely to a lit Christmas tree, used it exclusively for a week in St. Maarten (woohoo!) earlier this summer.  Equatorial sun is unforgiving, yet, no burn- not even a light pink spot on either one of us.  The rest of the group was COOKED and we just had a nice, healthy glow.  Also, as I stated in my primary review-  a little goes a long way!  You get tremendous mileage out of a 3.4 oz tube and the more you use it, the better you get at gauging quantity/coverage.  I absolutely love this stuff! This is a very thick sunscreen. A little goes a long ways. I have been buying this sunscreen every summer for the past four years. I use it on myself, my two small children, and my husband uses it too. It's non-toxic and it works. Stays on in water unlike anything else I've tried. When we go on vacation I put it on in the morning, go down to the beach, play in the water and sand, and hours later when I shower I notice the water beading up on me because the sunscreen is still there. I do reapply a few times for a full day on the beach, but for an afternoon at the pool a single application does the job.I do tan slightly with this product, but it happens gradually (no burning) and I'm sure if I were more consistent/frequent with reapplications I could prevent tanning. It does not leave a white residue unless you use way too much or are slow with your application - you do need to spread it out and rub it in fairly quickly to prevent a slight white cast.I love that this sunscreen is fragrance-free, but I wish it did have some essential oils to make it smell better. It smells like your standard thick zinc sunscreen, not bad but not great either. My only beef with this product is the smell, though, because I feel like when I get sweaty while wearing it, it makes me *extra* stinky. But, so far I haven't found anything else that is clean/green/non-toxic, stays on in water, protects well, and doesn't turn me white, so I just keep buying it. I have Muir-Torre syndrome. I am a prime candidate for a hose of cancers, including melanoma. So far I have survived colon, prostate and small bowel twice. And I quit counting squamous cells at around 20. So, I am really serious about sunscreen. Mineral is the only way to go if you're worried about cancer more than sunburn. the trouble with them is they feel heavy, tacky on your skin. so does this one, but not so much as the others. Spreads easily, disappears. DOES NOT MIGRATE INTO YOUR EYES if you keep it away from the outer corners. I've tried at least a dozen mineral screens, and settled on this one. I'm a big proponent of the physical sunscreens and did a lot of research in the cosmetic database.  For 2 years now I've been using Solar Rx, a very high quality physical sunscreen and have been happy with it's performance.  I spend a lot of time playing beach volleyball and needed a sunscreen that could stand up to the strong Southern California rays.  During a game a few weeks ago my brother had Burnout in his bag and I gave it a try.  By comparison Burnout has a slightly smoother and more fluid consistency than Solar Rx so it was easier to apply and work into my skin.  After using Burnout for a few weeks have decided to switch for several reasons:1.  Solar Rx is $7.92 per ounce while Burnout is only $4.94 per ounce -- almost 40% cheaper.  Neither product is cheap so it is a big bonus to save some bucks on sunscreen.2. Burnout smells better.  Solar Rx has a mild scent that I don't like that much -- somewhat like the smell of clay.  Though it is mild I have a sensitive nose and it bothers me a little.  Burnout's smell is similar to a fragrant or essential oil that is very subtle but more pleasant.3.  Burnout has a better consistency that is easier to apply.  SolarRx gets really tacky and when I dive in the sand I have a really hard time getting the sand off because it sticks strongly to SolarRx.  I don't seem to have the problem with Burnout."
210,B000V2FB88,"I have always had hormonal acne and this cleanser is great. My acne is under control now and my face is clear with the occasional 2 pimples, but I always had excess nose sebum. This stuff pretty much melted all the blackheads and excess sebum out of my face. I only use eye makeup so I remove that first with a cotton pad and the cleansing oil because I don't want to spread the makeup on my face. Once my eye makeup is removed I use 1 pump and rub the oil all over my face and warm it up. I let it sit for a minute and then rinse off with warm (not hot) water. I then use Pyunkang Yul face cleanser after to remove residue and any leftovers in pores. This product has been the key in dissolving my blackheads and not letting them reoccur. After about a month and a half of use I noticed the cleanliness of my skin.One note, I've been on Differin for 2 years and while it helps a lot it does not remove my blackheads. It's great for removing leftover scarring from the gigantic cystic pimples I'd get on my sides of my cheeks and chin/neck. Before using this product, my chin, neck, and nose just filled with blackheads so much. I stopped using nose strips years back which reduced my skins irritation but still had blackhead issues. My chin below my lip in particular just grew blackheads in practically a few hours even after extraction. Huge and painful and sometimes getting infected. I never skipped washing my face and using unscented product. This product has been the only thing to safely and almost permanently remove the blackheads from all over my face and neck. It very slowly shrunk the pores and cleaned them out over the course of a month instead of ripping them out and leaving large holes to be filled immediately.I've been using this oil cleanser for maybe 4 months and it is amazing. I prefer the orange one over the pink one because the orange one is deeper cleansing. I feel they both remove eye makeup the same.I am very happy with this product and don't feel embarrassed over my skin anymore I really like it, will buy this again.Pro: Smells good (orange). Make up come off easy without any effort, no need rub. Affordable price. There's refill with cheaper price, and eco.Con: Need use this with dry hands on dry face.I like this cleaning oil, it clearly off without rubbing. Many people doesn't know that rubbing skin is bad, because it is creating wrinkle and dark spots in future.Japanese Direction says; apply 3pump on dry hands, gentry massage on dry face, and wash off.Personally, I adjust amount how much use. When I only apply BB cream, then 1pump is enough. Full make up but no water proof, 2pump is enough. Full make with water proof, I use 3pump.If you prefer use with wet face/wet hands, I recommend you ""softimo speedy cleansing oil"".Hope my review is helpful for you. I had never tried oil cleansing before, but my skin has been extra dry this winter, so I would figured I would give it a try.  You don’t need a lot of the oil, just one pump which I warm in my hands and then massage well into my face.  The oil works wonderfully at removing makeup. Before rinsing,I wet my hands with water and work the oil on my face into a creamy emulsion.  The oil rinses away easily after which I wash my face with my regular cleanser.  This is a good product at a good price. It melts away blackheads and sebum plugs. You'll see it coming out on your hands. Does a really good job at deep cleansing. Use it first, rinse it, then wash your face again with a water based cleanser. Perfect routine. Cleared my acne in a week. I used this first as a double cleanse and was shocked to see all of my acne clear up will buy this a billion times over again This product is very moisturizing and takes off all of your makeup! I would give this a try. It’s great for removing makeup, sunscreen, and blackheads, but be careful around your eyes. It may just be me, but it was a little irritating around the eye area. I thought it would have a nice smell but it doesn’t smell like anything."

212,B00154NY5S,"Product had been on a shelf or whatever for some time. Stickered and re-stickered. Residue leftover on the tube. Felt light as if some of the product was gone. Sketchy. Won't be putting this in a stocking. Looks like I pulled it out from under a dirty sink and it had been there for awhile. Yuck. A very effective and soothing lotion for dry and sensitive skin.  It has worked very well for me for two years and I highly recommend it.  The prior lotions I had been using were much less effective or greasy.  This lotion absorbs well into the skin and then the suppleness lasts for 24 hours on me. I have sensitive skin and can develop eczema if I don't have the right moisturizing so this ahs been wonderful for me. Ended my dry winter skin problems. El precio,rápido envío y me encanta el aroma Bought this along with the softening version of this cream and it is a lot lighter in formula that the softening one (which I am in love with). I haven't really tried it out yet but it seems to absorb and spread just as well as the other one. There is no scent as such however when I tested it out on a patch of dry skin, the finish was TOTALLY different. While they both are moisturizing, spreads beautifully and absorb quickly into the skin, this one tends to feel average compared to the softening one that transforms skin into pure silk. I understand that that should be expected since they are geared to tackle to different functions but I guess I was just expecting...more? Anyway, it is a great buy. There is nothing not to love about this product. It's has an amazing texture, creamy and rich but never greasy. The 10% urea in it might cause a tad bit of tingling as you apply the cream, but it soon stops. Oh the fragrance - it's divine. My cat hates all fragranced products, but it kept sniffing this one.The best part perhaps is the incredible formula of nourishing ingredients - you have ceramides, peptides, vitamins and antioxidants and you get a liberal supply of the product in every tube, considering that they are so affordable. This might very well become something I keep repurchasing. This cream is SO nice and it is actually making a difference in my skin.  Living in a hot and dry area can take its toll but this cream is changing my skin for the better Great firming cream, I do use it on my face, highly moisturizing and does not cause breakouts...in fact it actually helps keep episodes at bay. I really like Gold Bond products so I got this for my wife when it came out.  She loves it, she says it's better than Avon or Oil of Olay (can I write those names?).  Her skin feels so good that I can't keep my hands... oops I think I'm saying to much.  Anyway my wife and I think it's a wonderful product at a very good price."
213,B001FB5TLI,"We have been using Caress body wash for years.  We have it in every bathroom for showering and hand washing.  My hands have a tendency to get dry and Caress really helps. Very pleased with Caress and grateful for the deal! Thank you I am thrilled with this purchase!  I can't find these anywhere and to get so many for such a great price just made my whole month!!!! Very happy with this. Thanks. GOOD Using for years highly recommend. This is a great body wash.  I will reorder. This is no longer widely available. It used to be available in Target, Walmart and in supermarkets. Now? It just doesn't exist. It's my favorite body wash, and this is the original formula. It's definitely worth buying and stocking up on."
214,B000J41MNG,"I’m a fan of soaps that do good things in the world (like Alaffia) and so I wanted to try out Nubian Heritage. As far as the soap goes I didn’t love it. The ingredients have changed drastically in the last year – the product images and listings for these soaps need to be updated. The main ingredient is now palm oil and the scent is from “Parfum”, which is the 5th ingredient, rather than actual coconut oil and papaya, which are now very minor ingredients – 11th and 14th, after titanium dioxide and EDTA. See my photos below showing the actual ingredients for the new version of the soap. The soap does have added glycerin and shea butter, which make it creamy and not so dehydrating. But I’d rather stick with a simpler soap that smells (and looks) like its ingredients rather than one that’s made from palm oil and then masked by an artificial scent and unnecessary pigment. I’m disappointed that Nubian Heritage has taken this turn.Overall, I’ll give the Nubian Heritage soap 2/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. The packaging is cardboard but isn’t listed as recycled or FSC-approved. The soap is cruelty-free, and has the PETA bunny logo. One ingredient, shea butter, is listed as Fair Trade and organic, but it’s a minor ingredient – 8th after salt and the pigment titanium dioxide. Sundial Brands, who make Nubian Heritage soap in New York from imported ingredients, are a certified B-corporation. They say that they are focused on “sustainable social and economic empowerment” but on their website they don’t provide any details on their trade practices. I was really surprised when I looked up Sundial Brands on GlassDoor – there were only three employee reviews, but all three gave only one star for working conditions and didn’t have good things to say about the company. My main concern is that they have switched to making the soap primarily from palm oil rather than coconut oil. In response to a query, they say that their palm oil is RSPO-approved, but they declined to name their supplier, saying that it’s “proprietary.” When it comes to palm oil, I prefer to see more assurance (on top of RSPO-approval) that habitats and human rights are not affected, and if there are other options available I’ll choose them instead. If Sundial Brands go back to using coconut oil or buy organic palm oil by direct trade (/Fair Trade) with West African communities I may reconsider. Until then, I will chose instead to buy from more transparent companies like Alaffia, Kiss My Face or Dr. Bronner's. It's soap. It's not drying and the scent is mild. My son and I use this for our faces only, so it's perfect for us! I bought 5 different bars, and this is his favorite scent. Very happy with this purchase. After reading several reviews of this soap on amazon, I purchased this product originally for my boyfriend. He has moderate acne, mostly black heads, and a lot of acne scars. Also, he had dry skin. I use the word HAD because his skin feels amazing now. He stopped breaking out! his complexion looks a lot amazing. I love my boyfriend 10 x more now because his skin looks beautiful hahaha.So I decided to use this product on myself since it had such amazing results on my boyfriend. I have used it for almost 3 weeks now, varying every other day. I cleanse this product onto my skin with a rubber brush for about 5 mins, or maybe even less. Then I would lather and pat cold water on my face to rinse the soap off. I've noticed that if you don't pat cold water to remove it off, and instead, just kind of rubbing it off, it makes your skin feel a little dry. But other than that, the soap is amazing. And let me tell you, my skin looks absolutely different. This product is not harsh on my sensitive skin, in fact my redness reduced significantly. My pores on my nose have also shrunk, my black heads are slowly but surely diminishing. I used to use Make Up For Ever in #2, which is a fairly light skin tone, and it would blend in with my skin so well. Now, my foundation is darker than my skin! My skin is a whole shade lighter than before. my face feels like a babies butt, lol. The soap also smells nice. I'm completely innnnnnnnnnnnnnnn loveeeeeeee with this product. So so so buying this product in the future. This is the soap I have been using for my face for years. It's the only thing I have used that doesn't dry and irritate my skin. I only use natural, superfatted soaps like this to wash my hands. Forget regular commercial hand washes in those pumps- especially the ones with all the cool scents- even if they say “moisturizing Hand wash”- they are all garbage that have harsh detergents that over time, just  leach the moisture right out of skin, ESP hands.Traditional soaps like this strip only the dirt, grime and germs, but leave the oil in the skin intact. My hands have been so much softer and less rough and dry since I started washing my hands in natural soaps. If you’re hands are constantly dry no matter what kind of liquid hand soap you try, try this. Thank me later! Okay so I'm african so I'm used to all different types of smell. But this s*** right here? NAH. It probably smells like a coconut more then papaya. I've used so many different coconut products and have had no problems with the scent but this stuff makes me wanna throw up. I still use it on my skin cause I don't want to waste it lol. I've been using it for a week now after reading reviews, and watching YouTube videos. So far I would say it's not very moisturizing cause my skin still feels kind of rough after my showers. The smell doesn't last very long either. It might linger in your bathroom for a few minutes but that's it. I had a breakout on my face after applying either this, or the Raw Infused shea butter with coconut and papaya so I'm not applying this on my face anymore. I'm going to be trying all the soaps and lotions on the Nubian Heritage line. So far, I will not be purchasing the coconut and papaya soap again unless I see a significant difference in my skin after the bar soap is gone. I would say I don't necessarily have problem skin. Just my stomach and back is darker than my body so I'm trying to even it out.. Might do an update if I see any differences in my skin.."
215,B0011FPIAK,"I live in a hot, humid climate and have oily, (adult) acne prone skin. I bought this because lotions are too heavy for me and I wanted a light, daily facial moisturizer. I’ve been using it now for about 2 years, and my skin has—legit—never looked better. People actually comment on my glow when I’m not wearing makeup. That has NEVER happened before. I don’t believe in miracle products, but this gel is the only consistent thing in my beauty routine. Every morning after I wash my face, I apply about a pea to dime sized amount, rub it in a little and let the rest absorb. My face feels refreshed, balanced, firm and not sticky or greasy. I just finished my 2nd bottle and I'm back to re-up. Pros: + 99% Authentic Aloe Vera + 1% (Cucumber, Comfrey, Allantoin) + Dries and Absorbs In Skin Fast + Moisturizes And Revitalizes Skin + Skin Will Feel Sleek And Clean After Application After A Few Seconds + Cool Feel + Relieves Skin Irritation + Great Against Swells And Dried Bumpy Skin - (Results Showed After A Day Or Two For Me) + Great Against Acne + If Applied On Face, Face's Oily-ness Is Noticeably Reduced To None The Next Day + Pretty Good Against Scarring, But It Will Take Some Time To See Results - (Mine Took About Two Weeks To See Some Improvement) + Light Refreshing Smell To No Smell On Application + Great Against Humid Climates + Great Against Muscle Pain - (Cured My Lower Back Pain Instantly The Next Day After Application) + Great Price + Not Sure About This, But I Think It Wards Insects As Well - (Like Mosquitoes.  Been Having A Lot Of Them Lately In The Apartment And No Bites So Far After Application)Cons:- None Atm.Verdict:I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  I have already bought 3x extra bottles after using my first one, it is just that darn great. I have been using this aloe since 2013.  I buy multiple containers and place them in all the rooms of my homes. I just went to use one of my new bottles and it was gross with mold in it. This is the first time it has happened to me and  I was able to get a refund but am not sure if that is because I am a prime member. It does make me a bit nervous but I am hopeful that it does not happen again, because this is my favorite aloe.update: 11/11/18i know my last review was about the nasty green mold however,i finally ordered this again and the aloe is clear and with out any mold so hooray, I am gonna start buying it from this company again because it really is my favorite. I bought this product because my mother had been telling me for ages to use Aloe Vera gel on my acne. Sadly, for years I never listened and continued to buy every expensive ""miracle"" wash/kit I came across. Nothing worked, and I was just throwing more money down the drain, not to mention my acne wasn't going anywhere.Well, my mom and dad came over for my Bday last month and saw how bad my skin was getting. My mom took me aside and told me to just trust her, and try applying some aloe vera gel (with a few drops of tea tree oil) on my face morning and night and see if it helps. I decided to give in and ordered this stuff.No BS, the first time I put this gel on my face I saw the redness/puffiness reduced in less than an hour. My skin was soft and didn't feel tight or flaky. My acne is getting much better and my skin is sooooo soft. I hate to say it, but ""Mother knows best"".... This is my second purchase of this Aloe. The first had no smell and was moisturized my skin. This one is runny and has a weird oily smell. I have sensitive (break out easily) skin and purchased this Aloe Vera Gel to wear as a facial moisturizer under my makeup.  I've been using it for about two weeks now and I love it.  It has not caused one breakout and has relieved my seriously dry and seriously flaky skin.  It goes on cool, absorbs quickly and a tiny bit goes a long way.  Other Aloe Vera gels I have used in the past SEEM to absorb quickly, but they actually leave a slight film on the skin and flake off (especially under make up), but this does not.  I put the gel on my face, then makeup primer, then makeup.  PLUS - I recently got sunburned and used it to sooth my burned skin & it relieved the pain and helped it heal more quickly.  I highly recommend it. Use it every morning, first thing. This is graphic but will help anyone else suffering from hemorrhoids:I put on a disposable latex glove and squeeze a wad of aloe gel onto the tip of the middle and ring fingers of the hand wearing the glove. Then laying on my side on a beach towel on the bathroom floor I push the aloe in and slowly rotate my fingers inside drawing a circle. This lubricates and stretches the opening. Doesn't sting etc.My doctor recommended I use Vaseline or white petroleum. Can't see myself putting crude oil inside so sanative an area. This aloe gel works great.Also, when done its easy to wipe off the extra gel surrounding the opening with a few pieces of toilet tissue. Helps cleanse the are too. So far I'm liking this, I purchased to use on my face as a natural moisturizer. I was a little worried because it had other ingredients, but because they were listed last I went ahead and purchased. Shipping was quick. I've used on my face a fee times along with ACV as a toner and so far so good. It's a great consistency, not too gel like like I expected and not too watery. One little squirt does it and my skin was a great balance all day - not shiny and not dry. Praying it doesn't make me break out. I will continue to use and update in a few weeks."
216,B000X9WXSU,"This was recommended to me by my skin doctor. Works fast on dry skin and does not stain it’s a light oil. I first started buying Evening Primrose Oil (EPO) after researching natural cures for acne. I'd been eating super healthy for months on end, taking excellent care of my skin, and couldn't figure out how to clear up my skin (I later learned that my primary issue were the parabens in many of my skin and hair products and going paraben free took care of the majority of my acne)...I read that EPO helps eliminate the white sebum under the skin that causes white heads so I gave it a shot. Of course at first after taking it, you'll experience some whiteheads as your skin purges the gunk but after a while, it really clears the skin of them completely! I had to take them for over a month, 1-3 times per day (depending on how often I remembered) before I really saw the total difference.The other benefit I saw after a month or so was that my PMS pain was greatly reduced and my breast tenderness in the days prior to my cycle was completely gone. I now recommend this supplement to almost everyone I know, it has so many health benefits! If I miss it for a few days I notice the difference in my skin pretty quickly.I now only take one a day, sometimes twice a day during PMS times. Here is the supplement version I recommend, I love this oil. Got 4 stars cuz bottle came with no top. I bought this back in march and it has held up so far! The only complaint from me is that I followed the storage directions and it smells absolutely horrendous. Im a little more than half way done but I simply can’t bring myself to finish the whole bottle because the smell is so so bad Nice, moisturizing, lightweight oil. Would purchase again I am a DoTerra oil user and consultant. I needed Evening Primrose Oil quickly and we don't have it. I have used the  NOW Solutions products before and really like them. I have been using this oil for a week now and it is work great. It also soaks into my hands nicely after I use it and does not stain my clothing. No scent to it so it does not clash with my perfume. Make sure to keep the oil fresh, because once tarnished it won't work as good so close the clasp each time. But it is good for people who suffer from acne, I don't myself but I develop extra oil around my nose and chin so it is good for oily skin.  Oily skin occurs when the skin is not getting enough moisture so it causes excess oil to develop so right out the shower I put it on while my pores are still open. it is pure primerose oil, but somehow skin with eczema its not good, my skin is combination , not for my skinbut for hands and feet it is good."
217,B00164FKWW,"I’ve had this product before and it cleared all my dark marks and spots almost instantly. I really like this product!!!! It cleared my skin under a week. I also use 2 serums and a face wash and I guess that helped as well, of course.Nevertheless, this product is really worth the price… it’s a big bottle as well so it is one that will definitely last quite sometime too. Acne entered my life when I was 11 years old. I have never found a product that is at least a little bit effective. I have tried products from 5 bucks to 60 bucks and none of them work. Although I am happy about the product, it might not work for you cuz every one is different.My condition: I got continuous break out. So my face always looks like the following:30 non-inflamed bumps on each side of my cheek. There are 10ish pimples. Half of them look like larger inflamed bumps but they are actually inflamed. Around 5 of them are large, white, and really on the top and ready to naturally pop out. 10 bumps on the neck. 2-3 of them are inflamed.Pro.1) Effective in killing P. acne bacteria. For non-inflammatory acne like little bumps, the product is awesome. I got around 30ish bumps on each side of my cheek. They were visible if I stare at myself 40cm-50cm (1.2ft-1.5ft i guess) from the mirror. After one week, all of them shrink. Most of them are only visible if I scrutinize myself within 15cm from the mirror (4inch-5inch i guess). And the overall amount reduces to 15ish really tiny bumps on each side of my cheek.2) I think it also helps the healing process for the existing inflammatory acne. BP can never kill the existing pimples since they are already inflamed. But it helps my already-naturally-popped pimples turn in to dry scabs quicker than they usually do. Note I am talking about those wound that already closed. BP can never applied to an open wound. As soon as the scabs go away, my nice and new skin are perfect. The redness remain so that I still suffer from even tone but it is nicer to have acnes.3) Dryness. (This might not apply to you if your face is dry or sensitive.) Benzoyl peroxide is a anti-bacteria as well as a drying agent. This percentage of BP dries my faces a little bit to control the excess oil but not too drying to make the face producing extra oil.4) It stops me from picking and popping my acne! The pain of apply BP on an open wound thwarts me away from popping my pimples.5) It makes me wash my hands more frequently. (BP is a bleach agent...so it actually help me to improve my personal hygiene habits.Con.1) Not so effective on my neck. I can tell the bumps are smaller but not as impressive as the change on my face. The overall number of bump does not decline at all. (Maybe they are already inflamed so BP cannot help. Or maybe 2.5% is not enough for neck.) Let me wait for two more weeks and conclude.2) Itch! I have rough skins so I usually do not feel any pain. All the irritating OTC products are not irritating from my perspective. (I mean those Sal Aid 2%, Ratinoid, Alcohol products. I do not mean those chemical peeling products...) Good news is that the itch usually lasts about 5-10 minutes. It is still bearable. And I do not need a fan to calm down my face. Let me update later if I could build up a tolerance against itch.3) The waiting time. Dan suggests 5-15 min waiting time which I think it is not completely correct. The waiting time is crucial but it is suffice if your face is dried and there is not excess water/product. In my case 2-3 min will be enough for the time between cleaning and putting BP. And 5-10 min is enough between BP and moisturizer. 15 min will over dry your face. For dry skin, this makes your skin less hydrated, speeding up the aging process. For oily skin, the over-dryness makes our cells produce extra oil, making a better environment for P.acne bacteria.Overall it is a good product. But every one is different. Good luck. I bought this because NOTHING on my skin was strong enough to clear it.I had clear-ish skin throughout the summer with the exception of skin colored acne bumps all over my cheekbones/temples/jawline, when I started my first semester of college my face broke hell. I've had acne all throughout my school years but NEVER this bad and scarring. I first tried to treat it naturally by cleansing my face with coconut oil, moisturizing with hempseed oil, taking Maca tablets, Liver cleansing pills, probiotics and Betain HC, and toning my face with ACV and tea tree oil, that obviously didn't work. My face was getting worse and worse and i had no idea why my acne was so awful all of a sudden. I finally decided to buy a natural acne wash with salicylic acid, my acne didn't change. I bought a 10% BP acne wash HOPING the BP would do something, it didn't, so i decided to use a dermatologist subscripted 10% BP acne wash. That also did nothing to sooth my face. During the time of using these BP products I experienced no dryness or beaching, which i suspected meant the products weren't doing anything.So, finally after months of searching i decided i would go with a BP cream to see if that would do anything, and of course the reviews on acne.org caught my eye. I read every review so i knew what to expect when i first use and what my ""end result"" should be.I used this product twice a day immediately when i received it (i was too excited,i do not recommend) and right away I had extremely dry/cracked skin. Whenever i would put moisturizer on it felt like i was rubbing lotion onto a leather handbag and there was never enough moisture to put on my skin. This was just for the first week, it took a month for my skin to adjust fully to the dryness. After that for the next month I had a lot of breakouts, this didn't bother me as i knew BP takes a couple months to even work so i knew patience was key. I was getting cystic acne from this, but i was getting cystic acne anyways so again, i wasn't all that bothered than i already was before. when i came back from a month long winter break i saw IMMEDIATE results of my skin colored acne bumps, 90% were already gone. These bumps, even though skin colored and not visible, gave my skin a terrible texture in normal sunny light. I had them for 2+ years and for the first time they were vanishing. This gave me motivation to keep using this product. Month 2: I was still breaking out normally + some, but in Month 3: I noticed a drastic difference. Again, i still had breakouts, but my skin was much clearer and even toned! my complexion was smoother than before and my cheeks weren't bumpy from scarring. I keep noticing improvements every week! My face is constantly becoming less red and acne prone. I cannot wait to see the results a year from now!My routine: I clean my face with a glycolic face wash, then apply the BP gel, aloe vera + reship oil, salicylic acid cream and top it all off with the oil free Alba moisturizer. (lots of stuff i know)I am going to omit the gycolic face wash and try using the acne.org AHA gycolic lotion 2x weekly instead to see if this is better for my pigmentation!overall i am so happy i found this product and so thankful it has worked well for me thus far, i would recommend giving this product a chance and STICKING with it. it could take up to 6months-1yr to get the results you want so please don't toss it if you don't notice immediate changes. All my changes were subtle but impactful. This is a quality product and a little goes a long way. I love how the bottle will last me a long time. However, there is some irritation while using it on my skin. Also, the fumes from it will make my eyes water if I use the product on my lower portion of my face."
218,B001CM1XX8,"This is the second bottle of Acne.org jojoba oil that I've purchased.  I did try a cheaper brand (Dr. Adorable, Inc.) and didn't really like the smell.  I started using this product because I wanted an oil that removed make-up and it works fantastic and it does not clog pores.  I also add this to my facial cleanser, facial masks, body lotion and I also add this to my dog's shampoo for his dry skin and works fantastic.On a side note:  My daughter has been suffering from severe acne rosacea, sensitive, dry skin for 6 years.  This has been directly related to the Yaz type of synthetic hormone Drospirenone.  My daughter went on the pill at 15 because of normal hormonal acne and bad periods and we thought we would take care of both and I had success with the pill in the early 80's.  This pill experience for my daughter has been a complete disaster.  Doctors did not help at all.  None of them had a clue about these pills or acne.  They only care about making money off of these horrible acne products.  I would take her to the doctor and would tell them that these Yaz pills are not working they would switch us to another brand but the problem is that they were the same Drospirenone hormone but with a different name.  Two years ago I finally figured out that all of my daughter's ailments were caused by this synthetic hormone Drospirenone.  The FDA has issued warnings about these synthetic pills.  These synthetic hormones are seven times more likely to cause a heart attack/stroke than regular pills.  I immediately took my daughter off the pill over a year ago and the problems persisted.  Too many to mention.  Her hormones were trying to adjust because that hormone was in her body for 5 years. My daughter has basically been going through menopause at 20 years of age!  It is finally starting to taper off after a year off the pill! I fear some of these problems could be permanent.  They recently said that these synthetic hormones actually change the brain.  Her acne rosacea if finally going away but It took me two years to find the right organic products for her sensitive skin.  All of those over the counter products make it worse. I had to do this on my own because doctors don't have a clue.One thing I realized is that if you have hormonal acne during puberty that is normal but if you continue to have acne/rosacea after puberty is over than you actually have a disease or you are having an allergic reaction to the chemicals in the acne products.  Acne/rosacea are diseases caused by inflammation.  My son had terrible acne during puberty but once puberty was over it went away.  He uses no products on his skin.  Also all of these over the counter chemicals make acne/rosacea worse.  Benzoyl peroxide has a bleaching agent in it!!!  Salicylic acid is also horrible.  People who can tolerate these products become use to them as a crutch but when they try to get off of them the acne comes back even worse.  All of these products destroy the good bacteria on our skin and the natural protective mantle and leave it open to the bad bacteria (P. Acnes) and horrible skin irritation.  They want you to buy these products forever.  They never will cure acne/rosacea because it's a billion dollar industry.  I also finally found a product that killed off the P. acnes bacteria without hurting and irritating the skin and I figured this out by accident.  It's HYDROGEN PEROXIDE!!  I am going through menopause so I have hormonal acne and have been testing myself with products for my daughter.  I tried it on a large cystic acne on my back and it worked and decided to try it on my face.  I took a Q-tip and applied on one pimple on my forehead and it went away quickly without any skin irritation.  Then I used a cotton ball and applied it directly on other pimples on my face and it worked without any irritation.  Tried it next on my daughter with a Q-tip only on one pimple on her forehead but did not try it yet on her acne/rosace cheeks.  It worked also on her without irritation and tried it next on her cheeks and it worked.  She now uses this twice a day without any problems and her acne/rosacea has now subsided.  See other products below that we use.These are the organic products we use:- Teva Skin Care's Organic SBR cleanser (only cleanser that works on my daughter's skin) with a few drops of Acne.org jojoba oil- Hydrogen Peroxide applied with cotton ball (start out by testing on one pimple and go from there) to kill the P. Acnes bacteria.- Just Natural Skin Care's Anti-Aging Natural Facial Lotion with a few drops of jojoba oil (always add water to the hands or face when applying lotion.  Skin should never be dry otherwise it will not absorb into the skin.)  You can also try Roscara Wild  Irish Seaweed Skin Rescue Sooth lotion/gel with a few drops of jojoba oil for rosacea/redness.  Again make sure your skin is damp before applying.- Kiss My Face Botanical Acne Gel (apply directly on acne until fully absorbed into the skin)- Teva Organic on the spot acne treatment (They have one for the day and night)- Teva Skin Care's Renewal Therapy Enzyme Exfoliation Mask (Exfoliation is extremely important.  Uses this at least once a week with a few drops of jojoba oil.- Spa's Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask (Use this 1-2 times a week for 15-20 minutes) My daughter uses Teva's mask once a week and the mud mask once a week.  This is the best mud mask I have ever used.  It is actually diminishing those stubborn acne red marks.There is also something that can help/cure acne but it's going to sound bizarre and that is urine!!  I know that sounds nuts but I do know someone who tried it and it worked!!  He applied the urine with a cotton ball until it completely went away.  When the urine comes out of the body, it is completely sterile.  Doctors do not tell patients because of the ""ick"" factor and it's FREE!!  Doctor's don't want a cure.  My daughter does not want to try this method but I would go and check it out.  Stay away from the Accutane products.  Accutane is one of the most dangerous drugs ever put on the market.  It might put acne in a dormancy period but it does NOT cure acne.  I have known people who have been on this product a few times and it keeps coming back.  My son tried it for a week and went off of it because he was having severe side effects. Horrible pains in his kidneys, etc.  The original manufacturer stopped making it because of the severe side effects and deaths/suicides caused by Accutane.  Many lawsuits.  Also these doctors are getting kick backs from the pharmaceutical/chemical/acne product manufacturers.  I took my daughter to a skin doctor and he barely looked at her and didn't ask what she had been using or if she was on the pill.  He gave her a few shots of ""something"" for the inflammation.  I had to go online to find out what these shots were and they were anti-inflammation shots.  He spent the entire time pushing Accutane.  He was disgusting!!  It cost me $100.00 for that visit.Also make sure you are washing your pillowcase every day and your bedsheets once a week.  I use a sulfate free declicate detergent and rinse twice.Switch to chemical free shampoo and conditioner and keep the bathroom area clean.Switch to one cleaner for the home.  The only product I use is Bio Green Clean.  Best organic cleaning product in the world and Made in the USA!!!Do not use face brushes to apply make-up.  No matter how often you clean these brushes they always have bad bacteria on them.  Only apply organic make-up to the skin.Since acne/rosacea are inflammatory diseases, stay away from food that causes inflammation.  Try to eat foods that help with inflammation.  You might want to consider a probiotic.  Eat organic whole foods without chemicals, pesticides, etc.  Sugar is the number one ingredient that causes inflammation along with High Fructose Corn Syrup and other highly processed foods, i.e., the white stuff.  Stay away from fast food!!Good Luck and spread the word about hydrogen peroxide for acne/rosacea. I got this with the big 16oz acne treatment as well as the AHA because I'm from Costa Rica and it's just a bit expensive to get these one by one since they have to go through the whole package ckecking and taxes are pretty high, so I decided to get everything at once. The jojoba oil I love, starting by the bottle (just prefect to get a few drops or as many as you need) and ending with how it works, of course. I use about 10-20 drops in my hair (not the scalp) a couple of times a week at night, not regularly or anything, pretty much whenever I have time and just leave it until the next day that I wash my hair and it is soft, esay to handle and shinnier. I use a couple of drops in my lips as well sometimes to make them smoother. I haven't yet implemented it to the moisturizer becuase I feel like it is already a bit oily, but I just started the regimen a couple of weeks ago so I might do it along the way. I've seen that it can also be put in your daily conditioner or wathever you use to treat your hair (if you do). I mainly got it to mix with the moisturizer as it is suggested but I haven't done that yet since I just started the regimen and don't feel quite sure about the idea because my skin looks already quite oily with only the acne.org moisturizer. Only possible problem if you buy this outside the US is the whole taxes issues in your country, it can get pretty expensive and delay the delivery (I waited for the whole package for about 3 weeks). But the product is good. If you only buy this though (not with the treatment) it might not be worth it, better to get it in your local macrobiotic store, if they have it. After trying everything under the sun from cetaphil to retin-a to accutane to proactiv to [insert product name here], I moved onto try the acne.org line and discovered that my skin responds really well to it. Yeah, I have a couple active blemishes marinating somewhere at any given time but that is streets ahead of what Ive been dealing with for the past 20+ years of my adult life.Up till now, if someone told me to try putting oil directly on my face, I would have looked at them as if they just threw a cat out of a window.But after reading so many positive reviews of this jojoba oil, I thought ‘what the hell, let’s give it a shot’ and wow, I am so glad I did. This oil is amazing. It’s incredibly light (as an oil), absorbs quickly and feels great on my skin. It’s like my skin is drinking it up and Im not experiencing ANY breakouts from it. Again, mind blown. It’s improving my skin tone, healing scars, and giving me a nice glow.Highly, highly recommend you give it a try. I have moderate acne and dried out skin because of the medications that i use against my acne problem. I used olive oil for my skin, but i think it was too thick and cloged my pores. I was looking for something that would bring my skin healthy look and glow as i had 5 years ago. I am 26 years old, and few years ago developed damn acne problem. Using all those harsh products made my skin look horrible, way overdried and saggy, giving me a look of much older person. I was almost depressed. I finally went to a dermatologist and she gave me prescribed medications for acne, but still they where too drying. My acne almost gone, but dtyness was still there. I did reaserch and found out about jojoba oil, i decided to buy this one. I use it with medical super moisturizer cream. And it made wonders to my skin (i used before only moisturizer and it wouldn't help much). This oil is so light, absorbes very quickly, i use it at night and in the morning, and my skin gets young glow again!!! YEAAAA!!! GReat product!! I will definitly keep using it, it became my savier!!! Dry flakes that i had on my cheeks and forehead where gone whithing few days!! I just love it!!! Thanks a lot for this product!!!!!! No breakouts too!!! My mom stealing it from me, and she loves this oil too:)))))"
219,B00166633A,"Every winter my lips are dry and start cracking. I have purchase many lip balms. This product is more of a white cream that comes in a small tube. It works very well for those who have crack lips in the winter. It only need to put on very little and moisture it in because you will see the white cream. I frequently have extremely painful chapped lips.My anxiety worries at them, biting and ripping pieces of them off until they bleed.I also love my drying matte lipsticks that not even chapped, bleeding lips can keep me from.It sometimes gets so bad that there's layers of skin missing.I've tried lots of lip ointments and medicated balms and this is the only one that I feel instantly better upon application.This one has FOUR medicines in it:1) Camphor - analgesic/pain reliever (this is the only active ingredient in most Carmex)2) Dimethicone - lip protectant (this is the only active ingredient in Blistex lip balm; it's a type of silicone found in many hair conditioners and provides a layer to protect the skin)3) Menthol -analgesic/pain reliever4) Phenol - analgesic/pain relieverIt applies in a thin layer and sometimes needs to be re-applied a few times, but I INSTANTLY feel some relief as soon as it's applied.After a few hours, my lips are significantly better.I swear by this and I'm so thrilled I found this product.I love it so much that I completely used an entire tube.(This is rare for my ADHD self as I am always losing things and almost never complete a balm, but I digress.)If you're a fellow lipstick lover, this product can also be used five minutes prior to lipstick application. This helps alleviate the drying effect many lipsticks have as well as provides a more smooth texture. i had to continuously reapply it but a little goes a long way and it was a nice value for amount of money. It works well and great and quality is so good. Very happy with my purchase!! Didn’t know what would actually arrive as the picture did not match the description and keywords of the product. This lip ointment didn't seem to do anything for me. I used it many times over 2 days and my lips just continued getting worse. I do like the small tube that fits easily in a pocket and the slanted applicator tip made it easy to apply. I personally wouldn't order this again. I will not be without Blistex. This has been my go-to for healthy lips for years. I've tried other things and cannot stand the waxy feeling most of them leave ... NEVER the case with Blistex. It penetrates the lips and keeps them moist, supple and healthy. I use this only when I go sleep"
220,B000053676,"When I bought it last year, with tax, it was about $16. Now it's up to $39 before tax?! It's a very nice cream, goes on well, smells nice, but it's not worth the new price. I like the fact it is non gmo, vegan. I researched each ingredient and it is truly Nontoxic good ingredients, very helpful ingredients. However!!! after a few days of use it caused a rash under my eyes and on the eye lids. It is not refundable but Amazon is great and they refunded me. It seems like I'm always trying new products to hope for different results. I've been using this eye cream for a few years now and I have no crow's feet in my early 40s for doing so. Granted I used sunscreen everyday too but this is a nice gentle eye cream that also smells a little citrusy. I like the fact that it's not an inordinate amount of money to have to pay for this. Approximately $15 at the time for eye cream? That's a good deal for the care it gives. I've used this product for a few years but have noticed that it's not on shelves in stores any more. So I was VERY happy to see that I could get it on Amazon.One of the few eye creams that doesn't make my eyes water. Neutral smell, absorbs nicely. The pump did not come with a stem so I have to use a q-tip. Otherwise, I have been using this for years and it is a quality product. This is the best eye cream for lightening dark under-eye circles that I have ever used, in the worst pump bottle ever made. I went through one bottle, then switched to a different cream because I felt a slight burning sometimes when applying it (though it did not redden my skin), I thought the dark circles were nearly gone because I was getting more sleep, and the pump only worked when held and stored upside-down. After a few weeks using the other cream, the dark circles were back. I switched back to this cream and my skin is lighter again a month later and stays moist around the clock with morning and night-time applications. The pump, however, took about two weeks to start working, and I had to use a Q-tip to get some out until then. Why Avalon doesn't package this in a small jar like other eye creams, I can't imagine. But I will keep using it because it works and the price is right. I’ve been using this product for several weeks now and have seen a HUGE difference! I usually have circles (thanks, chronic allergies!) and my eye area dries out easily from cleansing. There’s no good way to cover peeling, flaky skin with makeup. This lotion is really moisturizing, absorbs well and has brightened my circles to the point where they cover with minimal makeup. I love that my eyes look less cakey. It doesn’t really have much of a scent, which I prefer, because I don’t like competing scents in face products. If you’re on the fence, I’d recommend trying it because you really don’t have anything to lose. At the very least, you get a moisturizing lotion at a more affordable price than a lot of other products. My favorite eye cream. Unfortunately it is no longer available on Avalon Organics."
221,B000Q7XDR4,"This product is very good at keeping your skin looking & feeling moisturizer, there is a light sent. Definitely will purchase again. I have no dislikes. I used this product for modi’s and I like the scent and softness. Been using for years. Skin is silky smooth. Soaks in fast. Doesn’t break me out. Love it!! This lotion is wonderful on my skin, great if you are a avid Tanner.  I think it's a little expensive,  but I try to use it sparingly,  I  have purchased other products,  but prefer this , thank you Smells great;  extends your tan; easy to apply; works 24 hours; use it on face and body.  Excellent product! From the past I have always been aware of his lotion's defect in the cap not functioning. That is something that I have always delt with on this lotion. As far as the seller, they were absolutely the best at getting my order completed and sent. They even provided 2 sample of bronzer! Never had anyone ship free samples with order! I will continue to order from this seller! If you can overlook the cap unable to pump your lotion, I would recommend purchasing from this seller! I have been using this product for almost as long as I’ve been tanning and never get sick of the smell or the way it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth after I apply it. It’s never greasy and helps smooth and firm the skin just like the label says. I noticed how quickly my tan fades when I don’t use it. I have tried other lotions (cocoa butter, hemp lotion, etc) and none work as good as this at moisturizing or making my tan last longer between visits to the tanning booth.  I would be lost should they discontinue it (so hopefully that never happens) because I don’t believe I will find another product that compares to this one! I love this product."
222,B00164FXYW,"I debated over rating this 2 or 3 stars. This moisturizer I used for months-the longest I’ve ever used a moisturizer. In coordination with the rest of the acne.org system (except for the cleanser, which I dropped after a week), my very noticeable and longlasting acne that lived on my face for a few years became almost entirely nonexistent. I got a lot of compliments and questions about how my face changed so quickly! This moisturizer was better when I was first using it. It made my face oily in many areas, and also made my skin have a strong yellowish tint. It made my eyebrows look very oily and yellow too if I ever got some of the moisturizer there, and if it wasn’t dry enough when I fell asleep, then it would stain my pillow (which I honestly didn’t mind at all). All of these things I was willing to disregard, as my skin was almost entirely clear! I put jojoba oil on top to help dryness, but when I put it on my forehead the moisturizer would drip into my eyes by the end of the day, stinging them. Another problem was that when I left the house in the cold weather, and had to walk, my face literally felt like it was covered in ice cubes (given, this was when it hadn’t entirely soaked in yet). Anyways, all of these things are important to know, but I was very willing to just deal with them. The only thing that really bothered me was my oily and yellow looking face! Then, after several months of using this, I began to get random rashes on my face. I never actually blamed this on the moisturizer, because these wouldn’t occur all the time, but when I switched to a more natural one, then I stopped getting the random patches of rashes on my face (which looked like poison ivy and felt like my first layer of skin was peeled off, and was itchy and wet). Also, my skin started to feel beyond dry and itchy, with a lot of flakiness. I had to keep on reapplying with a lot of jojoba oil, but it never worked! My face was just oily, dry, flakey, irritated, yellow, and annoyed. This moisturizer did not make me break out, but I would not recommend this due to all of its other negative qualities. Have been using this product for several years. After years of trying to find a product for my acne prone skin this has really helped. Use it in conjunction with the cleanser and topical cream, these products really do work! Finally a moisturizer I'm not afraid to use. This doesn't seem to break me out....so I love that. My only complaint is that it feels a bit heavy and like it doesn't absorb very easily, it also makes my already-oily skin quite shiny, so I use less product than they suggest. I really wish acne.org would create a facial sunscreen, too.UPDATE: The most recent time purchasing this it seems thicker, which I don't like. Like it sits on my face and doesn't want to soak in. After a decade of use, this might be my last time buying this. Great for adult acne. Has a medicinal smell and a yellow tinge, but works amazingly. I still use an over the counter heavy moisturizing lotion from time to time on my neck, eyes, and chin because they get dry, but my skin is totally cleared up. Stopped my antibiotics two weeks after using and my acne has remained under control (even hormonal acne which can be very difficult to get rid of). This range has proved extremely effective in controlling very severe teenage acne and my 19 year old is very pleased with it. He has tried many products with little success, even prescribed antibiotics had failed to work. Only gripe is that it's not available from amazon.co.uk. The postage from amazon.com was a major deterrent, and then on top of that we had to pay import duty of £16 as a condition of delivery which was totally unexpected. Needless to say this has been very disappointing and I am not sure if I will re-order this product. Please can this be available from amazon.co.uk? Me gusta mucho. Mi piel queda super bien después de que aplico el hidratante. I have used acne.org for almost 3 years. It really is effective in controlling skin problems. But the thing is its delivery. Tip in the pump is so fragile that it often gets damaged when I open the package box. I can't be without this mousturizer, I'm so sensitive and my skin hates pretty much any other mousturizer I've tried. Everything feels so heavy but this one just absorbs quickly, no residue and can be worn underneath makeup without getting you oily. I wish it had a little spf with it or if acne.org could create one separate that would be a plus. But I will continue to use forever. The bottle will last you forever and worth the price."
223,B00005NFBJ,"This is like masks used to be: a gel that dries and peels off. The clay masks are terrible on my skin. I've tried half a dozen brands and will never use one again. But this works! It's refreshing to use and can be spread thin and remain effective. My skin feels clean and tight and pores or visibly reduced after using it every week. Skin Feels so soft after each use. Good product to use for your face. I've used another brand of this mask many years ago (can't remember the name of it) and liked the cleaning and toning effects. I figured I'd give this one a try.The scent of the mask is similar to what I recall (slightly perfumy cucumber scent). It smells clean and fresh, but the aroma is not a green grassy scent like pure cucumber products, still nice though.The mask is a clear gel which melts quickly upon contact with the skin, but still retains enough of its sticky gooeyness that it doesn't slide off your face when you put it on. It also feels like some of the mask absorbs into the skin when applying. The other product I used years ago, was a bit thicker consistency and didn't melt or absorb like this one does. With this product, I keep having to put more on in the same spots to get a thick enough mask to peel off.After the mask is on properly it takes around 10-20 minutes to dry (depending on room humidity, temperature, etc.). The mask feels tight against the skin as it dries, but it is not uncomfortable.Peeling off the mask is a bit tricky as it does tend to tear if done too quickly. Plus if used around hairy areas, it tends to get stuck in the hair making a sticky flaky mess. The other product I used years ago could be applied around hairy areas without breaking apart, probably because it was a bit thicker.As far as cleansing ability of this product goes, I'm not impressed. It barely removes bits of ashy skin, doesn't remove blackheads at all, but it does seem to loosen bits of dry skin (but not remove them) and it removes excess skin oils. However, as a toning mask this does work fairly well, and leaves my face feeling toned and tighter than prior to using it. The fact that is does remove excess oils does leave a toned fresher feeling to my skin.Overall, nice gentle toning mask, but not the best I've used. I have bought this product many times and I will continue to buy this product. Inexpensive and worth buying I bought this facial peel after reading a lot of good reviews about it. It ranks pretty high on a lot of facial peel lists I have used it a few times and it is a good face peel. It does make the skin feel cool like putting aloe on your face and when I take it off it does make my skin feel moisturized and fresh. I think it even does a pretty good job exfoliating the skin - my face felt pretty smooth after using it. It's a thick gel like a thicker version of aloe gel. It is clear which does make it difficult to see where you have put it on your face and how evenly you have spread it out. It obviously dries clear which also makes it hard to see where it is when it comes time to remove. It tells you to leave on for I think 5-10 minutes but I would leave it on a lot longer than that because if it doesn't dry it's not easy to come off and because of the clear color it's hard to see what parts are dry and what parts aren't. Peeling off is a little difficult. It's hard to find a place to really start peeling and I haven't figured out a way yet to get it to peel off in one piece. You can wash off whatever is remaining but it's pretty sticky and can be difficult to wash off which is why you really want to make sure it all dries before you remove it. Also, definitely keep it away from your hair. It's really hard to get out of your hair without having to wash it. I both like and dislike this product. I do want to say that it's definitely *not* for first timers, and I am saying this as a first timer.For starters, the stuff is actually clear. I don't know what I was expecting; perhaps a cool minty green color, but clear threw me for a loop. This was actually the first hurdle because while I was applying, I didn't know exactly where I was applying it on my face. Turns out, I got it caught in the fine hairs of my hairline. *ouch*The mask doesn't.. smell bad. It's not a great smell in my opinion, kind of like laundry detergent mixed with the great outdoors, but it's not a smell I'm super fond of.**DON'T SMEAR IT ON THICK**Again, as a first timer, I had no idea what to expect. I didn't know you are only supposed to put a thin sheet of it on your face. I ended up using too much, waiting the 20 minutes for it to dry, only to find that it didn't dry. And I had already gotten too far to wait some more, so I ended up pulling it off my face in pieces and chunks and by the end I looked like I came out of a messy adult film.I will say, my skin *did* feel a little better after, so there's that.Four stars because it smells kind of like the laundry aisle, and it didn't get rid of any of my blackheads. It's more of a refreshing peel than it is a hardcore remover of blackheads. A little disappointed, but still a good product. I love this product! It’s fasting drying, painless to remove and has the consistency of honey. However I it doesn’t seem to be as efficient with deep cleaning or moisturizing. Though I like that it’s painless I doubt the weak pull would help as much with deep cleaning and I always finish with some lotion. Still, the product was great! It’s good for sensitive skin, and not itchy or uncomfortable. I would definitely buy again and recommend along with a few of their other products."
224,B001B9RGVU,"Have been using this product on my face and neck for over two years, and decided it was time to finally go public with a review. I could not be happier. I've been wearing daily sunscreen since the 80's when I started using Retin-A for acne. My skin has always been oily and pimply, and as much as I hated putting any kind of product on it, sunscreen was a must because of the photosensitivity. I used department store brand sunscreens (Clinique, Prescriptives, Clarins, etc) in the 80's and 90's, but was never a fan. I started Peter Thomas Roth sunblock(recommended by an aesthetician) in the late 90's, which worked a bit better for me until I became conscious of cosmetic toxins and did my research (with help from the EWG database.) Found out PTR had a slew of undesirable chemicals and tried about a dozen other less toxic sunscreens, none of which I was happy with. They were usually too greasy feeling or left too much white residue. Just about gave up all hope and was going to go back to PTR when I came across BurnOut. I really could not ask for anything more. It leaves a very faint film that actually works to even out skin tone and a leaves a very matte finish. Even though it does not seem to be drying at all, it's so oil controlling that I can actually mix in a little moisturizer before applying it to my face. This is significant because with all the other products I used before, I had to mix in an oil controlling product before applying, even though the T zone shine would still come through after a few hours anyway. I couldn't go anywhere without blotting papers. I love that I can control the quality and quantity of moisture that I need when I need it, like in winter. Since switching to BurnOut, I very rarely get whiteheads any more. And though I still get blackheads, I don't get them as fast as I used to so I can go months longer between facials, instead of going every two weeks. I get compliments about having beautiful skin now, which never happened to me before. I had such bad skin before it haunted and depressed me. I cannot think of anything negative about this product, which is amazing in itself as battles with teenage and adult acne over the years have given me a crotchety attitude towards skin products. I am not saying this sunscreen will solve your acne problems, but it will not make your problem skin worse. I truly recommend this highly to people with concerns about skin clarity, acne, and/or oily skin. For people with mature, dry skin, I recommend using a moisturizer with it. If this product were ever to be discontinued, I don't know what I would do. I know it sounds dramatic, but only if you've been through acne-induced hell would you understand.UPDATE: Winning combination discovered! Have started mixing in a dab of The Body Shop Honey Bronze gel bronzer to BurnOut to get the most natural looking skin color ever. A little bronzer goes a looooong way. I can't even tell that it's a bronzer tan till I wash it off before bed and see how fair I am (which shows the BurnOut is doing its job.) Try it for yourself and let me know how it works for you! I don't know if it's a result of hormones or age, but my skin is now a lot more sensitive than it used to be.  After having two episodes of contact dermatitis (swollen, very red, and itchy skin) as a result of skincare ingredients that I used to be able to tolerate, I had to completely overhaul my skincare products, including sunscreen.  I had tried ""natural"" (i.e., zinc or titanium based) sunscreens in the past, but I could not find one that did not leave me looking ghostly or caused breakouts.  I have very oily skin so I hate anything that feels like it would add more oil.Someone on another skincare forum recommended BurnOut's sunscreen, which is how I came to ""discover"" it, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the company is located in a nearby city, Santa Cruz, CA.  I took a chance and ordered a tube from Amazon and I used it as soon as it came in, while my face was still red and raw from contact dermatitis.Firstly, BurnOut did not irritate my still-healing skin, which was still red and raw when I started using it.  There is no ""sunscreen smell"" that one usually associates with chemical sunscreens, which is a plus in my book.Secondly, on my light olive skin, there is a slight whitish cast, although I'd be the first to admit that I perhaps put on more than most people, and I reapply at least once throughout the day.  BurnOut Clear has decent water resistance, and the sunscreen achieves that water resistance with ingredients that form a ""film"" on your skin, which with this one leaves a slightly tacky texture that might bug the heck out of some people. It doesn't bother me, except when I reapply it, and I can see it ""gunking"" together in spots (most of it around my hairline), but again, I apply a full teaspoon of sunscreen to my face, which is probably a lot more than most people apply.Thirdly, I have had zero breakouts with BurnOut, probably because it uses zinc oxide rather than titanium dioxide.  It goes on smoothly, spreads well, and has the aforementioned slightly tacky, but not at all greasy finish.  Some dry-skinned folks may find this sunscreen too drying, but since I'm quite oily, I don't mind it at all.  The slight tacky finish doesn't really bother me because it does sit lightly on your face rather than feeling heavy and greasy as some sunscreens do.  I imagine that if I were more motivated, I could apply some powder over to mattify everything.  The water resistance is very good, which is a nice change from other natural sunscreens that I've used in the past that have washed right off.All in all, a decent, non-irritating, non-chemical sunscreen at a good price.Edit 5/2/13:  I have since moved on to Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 for my face.  Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 goes on clearer than BurnOut, and the finish is silky-smooth, not the slightly tacky finish of BurnOut, making Elta a superior choice for underneath makeup.  However, since BurnOut is less expensive than Elta, I'll continue to purchase BurnOut and use it for my body."
225,B0019QHUTI,"First off before i jump into this review (since i have a lot to say), let me note this is coming from someone who already had a decent tan prior to using bombshell. By 'decent tan', i mean about a nice medium golden colour. I wasn't incredibly brown or anything and was stuck in a tanning plateau (which is so annoying). When people in reviews say they're ""dark now"", their level of dark usually goes unspecified so you're left kind of clueless since they don't bother to explain what they started out as before using a lotion. I feel explaining that gives a better idea of the product's true potential.I just tried this today in a lvl 3 bed for 10 minutes, and man I am the darkest i have been in a long time. Brown, not orange.  It smells the same after tanning as you first put it on but no gross smell. Has a cherry scent.The lotion is pretty moderate in terms of the tingle factor. It was hot but, not unbearable. And I was overestimating it a bit. It actually isn't that bad. I personally enjoy feeling hot when i tan, because I actually feel im getting a good tan. Afterwards, i was really pink and felt hot. I didn't feel burnt or tingly. Just my skin was warm to touch for a bit. Lasted about 4-6 hours then i was good.I also want to point out how much i liked that it dried pretty fast after i applied it. Id say about a good 45 seconds. I hate having to wait for lotion to dry before i can get in the bed. Sometimes with other lotions, i have to dance around or accumulate some kind of air flow because the lotion takes forever to dry. And its annoying. I know im not the only one who has that issue.The consistancy was smooth and not thick. I didn't have to empty half the bottle to cover my whole body. A little covers a good amount of surface area. That's a plus which means it'll last a lot longer.I was already tan when i started using this, but was majorly stuck in a plateau for a while which is what made me buy this lotion. I read if you're in a plateau and are having trouble getting darker, try a good tingle lotion. I got this one because of that reason and also partly because i am not a fan of cheap lotions whatsoever. They do nothing but waste my time and money. It sort of reminds me of the tattoo saying ""cheap tattoos aren't good and good tattoos aren't cheap"". A good lotion will not be cheap. Flat out. Especially if you're already tan, and are looking to get darker, you'll need to spend a little extra but this one was definitely worth it.If you're hesitant, please don't be. Its worth the money and gives a very deep brown tan. As for people just trying to build a base tan, i would not recommend using this to do that only because it is not for that. This is to trigger a richer tan after you got the base tan going on. Use something milder to build that good base tan before moving up to this. You will just end up burning yourself badly and it doesn't matter how much you don't burn easily. Everyone still does and CAN.Also, don't ever use a tingle lotion on your face. You'll cause blood vessels to break under the skin since its so delicate. Not a good idea.Overall, Bombshell is a major plus lotion and I am a very pleased customer. Seriously. Buy it. You won't regret it. So, a couple days before using this lotion for the first time, I used Swedish Beauty's Pink Diamond in an Ultimate Bed (45,000 watt bulbs, with 5 high pressure facial bronzers.)  The Pink Diamond was my first tingle lotion, and I felt a little warmer in the bed than usual, and when I got out I felt a little itchy for about 15-20 minutes.  Then I received this and used it in a regular bed (36,000 watt bulbs) with no facial bulbs.  I started feeling warm to hot on my shoulders while I was still putting this on as I got toward my legs, and I made sure to keep this off my face because the Pink Diamond actually caused me to burn and peel a little on my left cheek.  All I can say is after reading the reviews that this was a mild tingle, I was blown away.  Take into consideration that this was my 2nd tingle lotion use ever, but I used it in a regular bed as opposed to an Ultimate with the Pink Diamond, and the tanning itself wasn't too bad.  Getting out of the bed, however, was a completely different story.  I felt like I was on fire in several different parts of my body, and my shoulders looked blotchy.  The fire sensation was so strong that I didn't really notice much itchiness, but I stuck with it and refused to shower for hours to let the bronzers work.  It took about 2 1/2 to 3 hours before the burning sensation left some parts of my body (namely the front of my thighs because I tan in the buff.)  I've tanned before, and I've been tanning about 3 months continuously, so its not like I went in completely unprepared.  I have one hell of a base tan, and a naturally dark complexion due to heredity to begin with.  I also didn't like the smell of this stuff after I tanned...it actually annoyed me, where I can't say that any lotion has ever gone that far before.  End results were fantastic though!  I was much darker that evening, and I still see a difference the next day.  I will definitely be using this lotion again.  Screw the pain and the smell, if it gets me through my tanning plateau, which I've had a lot of trouble with, then its worth it to me.  I'm still going to use different lotions day in and out, but this will definitely stay in my rotation to help me extend my tan.  And who knows?  Maybe once I get used to this, I'll move up to a stronger tingle lotion lol.  I'm a glutton for self-punishment if it makes me look good.  =p First off, I am of a mixed race so I tan easily. I'm also an advanced tanner but I hit a plateau with my tanning. 😭 I couldn't get any darker no matter what lotion I tried. 😩 But BOMBSHELL? All I can say is WOW! I'll say this lotion is for the experienced tanner (with a good base tan already) and not only does it smell amazing but it will get you that deep, dark, pretty golden brownish color. 😍 You're going to notice a difference in 1 use. I promise you that.*NOTE- This is a WARMING (tingle) LOTION and it WILL make you feel like you're on FIRE 😩 your skin will even be a bit red after your session but if you can handle that then this is the lotion you need to achieve that color you want. The photo I posted speaks for it's self."
226,B000MVVK7E,"I had never heard of this brand before, and I happened to run across it when I did a search on amazon for eye creams. I've been using this eye cream for a few months now. I really like how light the cream is, yet it moisturizes the skin around the eye area pretty well. You don't need much. Less than a pea size amount of the eye cream is enough for both eyes, so this small tube has lasted me a while. I did not look for an eye cream for dark circles, firming, etc. All I wanted was something that would moisturize the skin around my eyes, which tends to be dry even in the warmer months. This eye cream did exactly what I was hoping it to do, so I will continue to purchase and use it. If you're looking for a moisturizing eye cream, I would recommend this one. I have only used this once so far just recieved it yesterday but my under eye area feels more moisturized but I do find it a little oily so I probably will only use it at night. Only time will tell if this becomes my new favorite go to for under eye cream. I do know people who use this that have scaly eyelids and they swear by this.  I also know people who have usedthis after using permenant makeup and they liked it a lot for the healing benefits and refined reduction. Stays kind of tacky and makes me breakout a bit around my eye area but my skin is VERY oily and acne prone and most eye creams are the exact same way on me.  I like that it doesn't sting or burn or make my eyes water.  It is hydrating but not deeply as it feels like it sits on top rather than sink into my skin.  It does plump and make fine lines look better.  No smell and it is creamy and light and easy to spread/tap on eye area. I have used this product for many years. I went on vacation and when I got there and looked in the mirror I realized I had small lines at the corners of my eyes. I used this for TWO DAYS and they disappeared. And have you priced eye creams? They usually cost two or three times as much.Excellent, effective, inexpensive product. What's not to like? I’ve used the Borage moisturizer for several years...this is my first purchase of the eye cream. It seems to be a very good eye cream...I’ll continue to use this one. The first time I purchased this eye cream was after reading reviews on this product and the Borage hand lotion. I am so glad I did.  I love the Borage eye cream.  I could see an improvement with the fine lines under my eyes.  I have tried several different eye creams and still have two other well-known brands.  I did an experiment. After using the Borage eye cream for a while, I went back to one of my other brands.  I use eye cream in the morning and in the evening.  The next day after using one of my other brands, the lines were more pronounced. The following day I used the Borage eye cream and saw an immediate improvement.  When I originally purchased the eye cream I ordered one for me and one for a friend.  My friend told me she felt she could see a difference under her eyes and was very happy with the eye cream. I was also able to see the difference on her. I ordered this eye cream for night use.  I'm in my early 30's and have noticed that my eye area has started to dry out.  The price of the cream is good for the amount of cream that you get, but it's very runny.  If I store the bottle on the lid as it is in the picture, when I remove the cap, the cream comes rushing out all over the place.  The cream does help to hydrate, but it's not hydrating enough for me.  I won't be reordering. I hate to ""review"" this product after only using it a week, but it's so good that I just had to share my thoughts. I'm 24 with normal/combination skin, but my under eye area is so dry. No joke, by the end of a work day my under eye area (because it's so dry) probably ages me 5 years. Being the broke college student I was (until a month ago), I was using the Walmart brand (equate) eye cream. It's okay, certainly better than nothing, but I just needed something with a bit more moisture. After browsing online for a new eye cream I came across the Shikai Borage Therapy eye cream and decided to try it because of the positive reviews. Like I said, I've only used it a week, but if my under eye area continues to have positive results, I'll certainly repurchase. Oh, and the Borage oil isn't greasy at all. It absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way."
227,B000NRV00Y,"I love how there is a variety of scents and oil that have different benefits for the skin. I have mixed some into my homemade body butter and it is amazing! I’d recommend grabbing these when you can. They aren’t greasy and are small enough to take on the go. Will definitely be buying again soon! It smells good Me encanta !!’ I like this for the arthritis in my fingers I paid for 10 bottles, the payment went through, and only one was shipped. And unpadded,  so it arrived smashed. Amazon service levels are slipping.***Update: I had an online chat with Maxx and the whole amount was refunded with no need to return the one with a broken box. I will donate that one to someone who needs it, as it was free to me. Maxx was a peach. The refund was in my account the next morning. Good save, Amazon, and good hiring, training, and customer service decisions upstream, too.4 out of 5 stars instead of 5/5 for the effort, time, and patience needed from me to resolve this.*** The best Arnica oil out there! Bought these for my mama at a great price. She loves weleda as do I.  Arnica is the best for muscle recovery and pain and she rubs this on her feet and says the pain is gone after that. Also. Love the smell. I always buy loads of weleda when I visit family in Germany. So cheap there! I ordered two types of cellulite products at the same time. The first one was aveno firming and toning gel. It did help but I wanted to give this one a try. I had used Birch Cellulite oil years ago but couldn’t remember why I stopped. First it smells great…a light citrus scent. They’ve added a pump which is great because glass bottle + oil = slippery. It did help reduce the appearance of the cellulite but in my opinion it didn’t moisturize very well. I’d walk around for a couple of hours like an oily mess and a couple more later my skin was no longer moisturized. In addition it didn’t seem to go very far...I had to use a lot because my skin was soaking it up like a sponge…it would sink in rather than spread around. i went through the whole bottle in 2 weeks which would make it very pricy. I started mixing it with a small amount of cetephil cream both to add more long term  moisture and to make it go a little further. But of course I think that dilutes the strength so it may not be working as well as it could. I will continue to use it and rotate with the aveno which is cheaper and a little goes a lot further."
228,B000FCR7MM,"I use this moisturizing lotion after showering year round.  It rubs in quickly and does not feel greasy.  It does help my extremely dry skin look much better, and makes a tan look great.  I am loyal to Australian Gold products and this is a favorite of mine. Have used this product for years, used to be made in Clearwater Fla. you could buy it at CVS, not any longer, order online, it’s the best ! I love the smell of this lotion and it really does help my spray tan last as long as possible but like 20 mins after I put it on I feel dry like I never put lotion on at all My Skin dies Not feel dry After use although you need to reapply Ottern! Not what the bottle looks like, but for the price it’s nice after tan lotion!!! I like it, no complaints, except I just noticed my bottle is different from the picture 😂 This lotion works really well. Smells really good to. Excelente Smells great, not greasy, absorbs easily and doesn’t leave any residue behind. Definitely recommend!"
229,B000YC718S,"I love this spray. Refreshing and great way to start out your day Great productNot damaged and full bottle This product is quite fantastic. I was SO skeptical when my aesthetician recommend this to me. Now I can’t be with out it. Make me forget to moisturize some days. Amazing Dermalogica is a great company with great products. Refreshing start to the day. Light scent with efficient pump spray. Travel friendly in unbreakable container. I like this toner, have used it for awhile.  When I received the product, the box was damaged and the safety seal broken.  The bottle itself was fine but I can only hope it's the correct product inside. Love this product"
230,B000UBN5S8,"This is a wonderful product for dry hands! It’s a wonderful product for hand protection too, if you are a gardener, a potter, or an artist working with pastels, etc. This is a Barrier lotion, that seals in your skin’s natural moisture to allow the skin on your hands to actually heal from within and stay healed. It can also help resist the finger and nail staining that plagues some gardeners and artists, too. (For gardeners: to prevent soil-staining under the nails, put a bit of lotion in your palm, and scrape your nails through it to get the lotion well under the nails.)For most people, their hands will feel more moisturized, softer, silkier and instantly transformed after their first application. But, it is NOT a greasy topical balm that simulates moistened skin—it is a smooth and soothing protective barrier for the skin that prevents hands from being repeatedly stripped of their natural oils and moisture as a result of repeated hand-washing.For those who complain each hand-washing had removed it—it didn’t!  Once it is completely dry, it doesn’t get removed by hand-washing. The first subsequent hand-washing only sluices off the EXCESS of lotion that had been applied. It might be necessary to reapply it, though, if you wash your hands more than several times within a 4-hr. period, or if you wash your hands a few times with an extremely harsh detergent or cleaner of some kind.For most average users, though, applying a drop of it just a couple of times a day will likely be sufficient. For those with extremely or excessively damaged skin, it might take a couple of days of using it before you actually notice the healing process is taking place.  It worked great for me on my dry, rough, sore skin upon the very first application of it, so I didn’t have that sort of a problem, but I suppose one could add some other kind of greasy cream or balm once the Gloves in a Bottle had dried completely, if that would make someone more comfortable while the healing process was taking place. Once the skin has healed, I would think just using this lotion would be sufficient to keep hands that way.For those who complain it flakes when applied repeatedly—you are using Wayyyy too much of it, and probably using it way too often, too!  Only a small drop of this is necessary, and it works best when applied immediately after washing your hands and while they are still damp. So little of this lotion is necessary for each application that a bottle of it lasts a very long time, which actually makes it a fairly inexpensive product to use in the long run.I’ve been using this product for a few years now and wouldn’t want to be without it.  No request from the maker of this product to leave a positive review of it has ever accompanied any purchases of it that I have made, so my review is completely and totally voluntary, and not influenced by anything except by my own experience as a user of this product.  I consider it an extraordinary product that delivers superb results.That being said, if anyone suspected they might have suffered a severe sensitivity or allergic reaction to some ingredient in the product, I’d recommend they not continue to use it, of course.  For anyone else who didn’t get the immediate results they’d expected, however, I’d strongly suggest giving the product a reasonable try and a reasonable length of time to help heal their hands.  It’s really a remarkable product! I use this everyday and it is great! Non greasy and lasts all day. Pleasantly surprised and hooked !! Skin feels so soft long after application. I like the way it feels.  Sometimes it feels like its sloughing off when you rub your hands together too long A bit of history: my daughter (now age 9) has struggled with eczema for years. But last summer and this summer it moved to her feet, to the point where after swimming the first couple times of the season, her feet peeled and cracked and became extremely painful to walk on.  For all of last summer, and the first 5 weeks of this summer, she has cried every night going to bed about the pain she was in (or if not pain, intense itching that kept her up at night and made her scratch until her feet were raw) - her feet were full of cracks and multiple layers of peeling skin. I have purchased hundreds of dollars in various creams over the years, trying to give her some relief.  The doctor only confirmed it was eczema and prescribed a high-dosage steroid cream, which I didn't feel comfortable using longer term, and really didn't help much anyway.  We became convinced her issue was her feet getting wet, and once they were wet they would essentially shred, even with pool shoes.  The only option was to keep her out of water, which just isn't feasible in the summer in the south (we live in GA).Once we finally narrowed down to it being caused by prolonged water exposure like a pool or lake (she has no issues through the winter or with just regular showering), I started looking into products that would protect her from that, kind of like wearing some kind of waterproof socks, and found this.  I ordered it, figuring it would likely just be just another cream in the bucket that didn't do what it said, but I was willing to try anything.  First, we kept her out of the water for 1.5 weeks.  It wasn't easy, but necessary (we turned down pool birthday parties and anything involving water for that time).  Over that time, her feet began to heal, but we also began applying this cream, twice daily.  I loved that it was thin, smelled good, went on easy, but ultimately seemed to coat her feet and make them feel soft.  After a few days, she was going to bed without pain, and sleeping all night, for the first time in weeks. I don't know if it was the cream that helped that, or just the lack of water exposure. But then came the true test - she was going to be in water, and not only that, was going to camp where she would be swimming every day.  We made sure to apply the cream at morning and at bedtime, and also before getting into the water.  She still wore her water shoes as a precaution.  After 3 days of swimming, you wouldn't have even known it, her feet still looked so good. I was honestly in a bit of disbelief, as normally her feet would have been just shredded and peeling and cracking, and extremely painful.  After a week at camp (so a total of 8 consecutive days in the water), she came home to us in great spirits, running around in her sneakers (prior to this she could barely walk, much less run).  Her feet almost look like everyone else's, you would never known what they had looked like only 2 weeks prior.This has changed my daughter's summer life. And ours.The stress we felt every day, knowing the pain (both physical and emotional) she was in, was significant. It seems crazy to say, but this product has allowed our daughter to be a 9 year old again, enjoying the pool and friends and for once feeling normal, like everyone else.  Not only that, it's easy to apply, smells good, and truly coats the skin. I have told everyone I know about this, and especially all my friends who have walked this journey with us and our daughter.  I know most use it for their hands, but it works just as well on the feet, we have a walking testimonial in our house right now to that. I can't express what a relieved and thankful mama I am."
231,B000052YOR,"This is my go to product, mixed with a lotion in the winter months. Have been using it for years after bath or shower.  It’s light, absorbs into the skin with a delightful fragrance.  You can’t go wrong especially living in colder, dry climates. This Is Quality  !  Soft, gentle scent.. makes me feel Prettier.  Highly Recommend  ladies ....  Pamper Yourself. I have had dry New England skin as far as I can remember,. My husband bought this for me years ago and absolutely loved it.  I came across it again and I'm happy I did!  It def helps and is not greasy !  The smell is amazing, very soft and light. If they had a body spray with this scent , I would wear it.  Works great! Loved loved It’s not greasy at all .. soaks in really good .. I’ve used this oil for years. It’s a little pricey, but you don’t need much at one time to make your skin soft and smooth. I love the light fragrance. It is very calming.I have quite dry skin. It is great after a shower to use as all over.  Even lightly on my feet. The oil absorbs without leaving an oily feel on my skin. I love this body oil. Love this product. The smell is earthy. Wonderful. It is a great product for dry skin on legs. This is definitely not moisturizing but it does smell great."
232,B000OUTTP8,"I’ve been using this for years and it goes on easy and non greasy. I’m a guy and I like that it’s easy to use and goes on my face without visibility. I’m in the sun a lot it appears to restore my skin and I definitely have less noticeable wrinkles than friends my age (60) Love the product being fragrance free. Using for over 40 years. Apply after washing my face. It gives my skin a very healthy glow. A must for anyone with sensitive skin. Perfect! Makes skin silky smooth! Used for nighttime. A little heavy for my skincare. Moisturizer and mix small amount with base makeup.  Smooth application Product is reasonably efficient at Moisturizing and Depth of body and color, but fragrance leaves a LOT to be desired. I’ve been using this moisturizer for almost 15 years! I’ll never change my face routine after using this for so long! Great product! Always come back to it after try several different product, use it more than 10years"
233,B000KJRK2M,"I’m haoy I use to use a Monoi oil when I was younger, and it came to mind one day when I started tanning for summer. This smells fantastic ! Very moisturizing.I use after my shower while still damp. I sometimes have combined it with in my bottle of Rainbath bath oil, and wow ! The Monoi keeps my skin glowing, hydrated, and my husband loves the fragance and the feel of my skin. I also run my fingers through my hair after applying and my hair is shiney and well managed and I feel a great conditioner for night/bed time. I gave my sister a bottle, and she cannot get enough of it. I have even rubbed a little onto my lips, and into my nails and cuticles. I remember using a type of this oil mixed with my sun tanning oil back in the day.. but since I am indoor tanning bed this summer, I use after tanning and after shower.I will definitly make this a summer staple, and buy this product from this seller again :) I’ve used this for years for every beauty need. Hair, skin, nails. This cult classic has been on my to try list for ages before finding and ordering here on Amazon. What I received was totally authentic. Next time though I'll order the pure Tahitian Monoi without the added Jasmine (Pitate) scent as it's both super strong, in a piercing sort of way, and overpowering to the point of completely smothering the Monoi flower. If you love Jasmine, as I do, this is still lovely. It's just so strong that I have to dab it on as you would a perfume oil as it's too potent for all over the legs. A bit on the tips of the hair is nice too.Definitely pure Tahitian coconut oil as it solidifies when the temperate drops but this is easy to remedy by placing the bottle in a mug of hot water. As s touch of authenticity they add a Monoi flower to each bottle. Would like to buy in gallon container. Is this available in anything larger than the four ounce bottle? I got addicted to this in Tahiti and have been using ever since.  I'm definitely picky with my products and this is a stand out.  Be careful though, it is as advertised - an oil, so it will have an oily texture until absorbed by your skin.  I find it great to use during the summer months instead of body lotion.  You can even use it in your hair as a conditioner.  Doesn't clog pores.  One interesting tip: it's not so great for winter as the oil will congeal when the room gets cold, you will have to warm it up and ""melt"" it - easily done by keeping it for a few minutes next to your body. I love this product. I have been using it for almost 30 years and I always get compliments on how soft my skin is....plus it smells divine!!! I am an African American woman with natural curly hair, love this product, I am so impressed! when I went natural i began a search for pure chemical free products that would bring health and strength to my hair. Although I try to keep it simple I have tried quite a few products, namely essential oils. This coconut oil/jasmine blend is the best! I use it to soften and seal my precious curls. The coconut oil is one of few oils said to actually penetrate the hair shaft. This oil is light great on wet and dry hair it smells heavenly and i can even use it on my skin! I plan to continue using this product!"
234,B0000536P3,"I'm so grateful this is in Amazon.  This is the best facial lotion.  It keeps me moisturized and no icky skin feeling from not being absorbed like other products. Love this because it’s not too heavy. Goes on perfectly under makeup. This moisturizing cream is great and with good scent. However, it does not have a lasting effect once you stop using it Great product. Gave this Christmas 2021 I have been using it for 30 years.  It makes a huge difference in in skin.  I love it.  I can tell a difference in my skin.  I use it on my face, neck and hands.  Thank you 😊. Best price product is as expected. my wife liked it."
235,B0009F3R7E,"Right now it is winter time here where I am and my hands are extremely dry and lotion is not working for me but the Burt’s bees hand salve and the moisturizer helped my dry skin tremendously and made my skin transform from dry and cracked to smooth and soft I really like the chapstick included in this set it has a little tint to it which I enjoyed the lemon cuticle butter helped my cuticles and my nails have been growing longer. The almond hand cream is a rich buttery moisturizer which is perfect for dry skin I have yet to dry to coconut foot cream but have high hopes regarding the positive results from the previous products in the set I think this would also be suitable for sensitive skin. Overall I really recommend this set! My wife is a lotion freak . Gave this set to her as a Christmas gift and she loves it . It’s a small pack of the products, but they last a while! Burt’s Bees always has very nice products that seem to work on sensitive skin. My mom loves this brand and I get it for her often, it’s one of the most reliably good ones! Definitely recommend for gifts or to see which products you like! Bought these as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves them!! I love Burt's Bees. Wanted this for a gift but it was sent in a plastic bag and the box the gift comes in was trashed and wouldn't make a nice gift. Burt’s Bees are the only moisturizer products that I’ll ever buy because they’re consistently good across the entire product line. This variety pack proves it. Each of these products provides the perfect amount of moisture to its respective body part.If you have body parts and they need moisture, then you need Burt’s Bees. It’s the bee’s knees. A pre-birthday gift for my bff. Nice little sampler of a high quality product. The lip balm is very effective in very dry winter.Like the hand moisturizer."
236,B0001UWRCI,"It took me a solid decade of developing terribly dry, scaly, cracked-to-the-point-of-bleeding skin on my hands every winter before I learned that it's not just dry skin but eczema. Fortunately, my partner had suggestions for helpful treatments, as he semi-regularly deals with weeping eczema. Unfortunately, in addition to the dryness, I suffer skin allergies which mean that I react severely to most every eczema cream and lotion out there.Using a thick layer of shea butter overnight helped but it didn't penetrate the crusty outer layer enough to protect my hands througout the day, and by bedtime, they would be chapped and bleeding again. It was visibly very, VERY bad. If you're thinking to yourself ""Gosh, that sounds unbearable""... yes! Yes it is! I was hyper aware of the stinging, ripping sensations in my hands every time I moved and the skin pulled, every time I washed them and rubbed over all the little micro-tears, and every time anything mildly acidic, spicy, etc. came into contact with my hands and it felt like being splashed with acid. I could not take it any more.With some trepidation, I stumbled onto this product in my search for vegan sensitive skin eczema remedies and it has tremendously helped me. I will say I have never felt a lotion quite so emollient, as this one immediately feels much more moisturizing than your average hand cream. It absorbs well into the skin and isn't too heavy, sticky, or greasy. The odor is similarly non-offensive, with a mild herbal aroma that I barely notice. My only real gripe with this is the price! You get so little for a pretty high price tag, and it goes fast. I do appreciate that the company included tiny samples of some of their other products in the box with my purchase: that was kind!At the end of the day, though, it's hard to put a budget on the relief I felt after the first night using this lotion alongside my shea butter (which works a little better as a physical barrier covering the skin cracks, if you already have them) under a pair of fingerless cotton gloves which help to minimize lotion mess on my bedclothes as well as to retain moisture. I will admit this did sting a bit when I first rubbed it into my severely damaged skin, but I did not have an allergic reaction and the pain was much less than other products. I experience no negative reaction at all now that my skin has healed.I wish I had taken before and after pictures but, quite frankly, the before might have been too gory to post. Suffice it to say this product worked for me better than anything else I'd tried, even the products (shea butter) that did somewhat help. I still think I needed the shea and gloves to achieve this effect so I would recommend those for anyone with dryness as intense as mine. I might not be able to make this my regular lotion year round due to how expensive it is, but I will certainly place another order when the temperatures start to drop next year! This is the only produce that has made a difference in my eczema...especially on my elbows. My mother is a retired nurse. This is the only product her and her friends use for chapped, cracked or splitting fingers from excessive hand washing. I have used so many lotions and creams over the years for the terrible eczema on my hands but this is the first one to actually work. More than that, my hands no longer are red or scaly, and they maintain this softness and healthiness even days between applications. It's really amazing. I absolutely would recommend this to anyone. Every winter my hands end up dry, cracked and, at some point, bleeding. It's just an unfortunate inevitability. No matter how much heavy cream, vitamin E oil or even Neosporin I used, nothing kept my hands soft and well-moisturized during the coldest months of the year... until I discovered Yu-Be!After doing extensive research on the best creams for cracked skin, my mother-in-law bought me a tube of Yu-Be for Christmas. She purchased a couple other brands of heavy creams, too, in hopes that one or all would heal my poor hands. I wasn't terribly satisfied with the other creams, but the tube of Yu-Be was the best gift anyone's given me in a long time! A few days of use, and my hands felt wonderful. After a week, they were in better shape than they are even in summer months. I loved it so much that I purchased a tube for my purse and a jar for home from Amazon just before I finished off the tube I received as a gift. The price per ounce is better when you buy the jar, but the tube is convenient. Whichever you choose, this product is well worth the money! A little bit goes a long way in repairing frazzled skin, meaning a small tube lasts a long time and makes this product an even better buy.When you first apply Yu-Be, it feels a little greasy, but it absorbs in a matter of minutes, leaving skin soft and silky feeling. I try to apply it just to the backs of my hands, since my palms are usually fine; I then rub the backs of my hands together to spread it around, sometimes put the excess on my elbows, rub my hands together to thoroughly work it in the rest of the way, and then wipe my palms so I don't spread the cream onto anything I might touch before it's fully absorbed. For a deep-conditioning overnight treatment, I wet my hands, apply the cream liberally, then put on a pair of stretchy knit gloves that I keep in my bedroom for this purpose (as well as for putting on stockings without snagging them!) and keep them on overnight. The next morning, my hands feel as good as they would after a week of normal daily applications.I highly recommend this product to anyone battling rough, dry and/or cracked skin! As with any skincare product, whether or not a product works for you depends on your skin type. I have sensitive skin, prone to be oily during the warmer months, and dry during winter. I also get the occasional cystic acne. I have been using Yu-Be moisturizer for over three years now, and my skin is soft, mostly problem-free. I use it year-round. At night, I use a retinol creme, but this is my daytime go-to. I also do not use it alone. The creme is on the thicker side, so putting it on my skin by itself will make things too heavy. I usually spray Heritage's rose water and glycerin spray, and then use just a dash of this creme while my face is still wet with the Heritage spray. The combination is perfect! The spray also makes the application smoother, and because it takes so little, it lasts forever! If you have combination skin, give it a try, but I definitely recommend pairing it with the Heritage rose water and glycerin spray for best results. This stuff is amazing. My hands are SO dry and cracked from constantly washing and this product really brings them back to nice and soft. The medicine smell isn’t great but I just use it before bed and wake up with soft hands again."
237,B001CJCFBK,"non-greasy - prevents wrinkles My dermatologist reco needed this plus a daily SPF. While it’s super lightweight, I feel like my skin wants to “drink” more. Me encanta que es súper ligera pero siento que me hidrata sin dejarme grasosa es PERFECTA ! The cream goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  This was actually recommended to me by my dermatologist.  They have a nice line of products. I purchased this cream to apply after the hialuronic acid drops I use as part of my routine. To my surprise, it gets absorbed very fast and doesn’t leave you greasy/ sticky after it and you can immediately apply your morning make up. Very neat finish, I love this moisturizer! Lightweight and clean. Leaves the skin feeling soft. Sinks in quickly so you can apply makeup without waiting. In the winter, I have normal skin, in the summer I have oily skin.  This moisturizer handles both.  I've tried a ton of moisturizers for oily skin and they are not as dry or invisible as this one.  At first I tried only applying at night, because EVERY other moisturizer that says it’s drying, absorbs well, or is for oily skin etc. still makes my complexion moist if you know what I mean.  This one however keeps me hydrated and smooth without the moist, oily, dampness, both day and night.  I still error on the side of night time only application vs. both daytime and night time because it's made a difference in my skin with just the single daily application (dryness shows age and this nips the dryness that even oily skin can can have, in the bud).  With cold or wind, I certainly use it twice a day and am happy with how my makeup sits over it.  Regarding the pore minimizing aspect, I think it does a little, don't expect miracles though.  With continued use I've discovered smoother, softer skin, maybe tighter pores per-se, a great canvas for makup no dout, or just a good nights sleep. I have sensitive skin. This product does not irritate my skin. Moisturizes wonderfully."
238,B000F0QCWA,"I am dealing with super dry skin lately. I use good lotion but wanted a thicker body butter. Well I got this one and was surprised at how thick it was. (1) I used a ""scoop"" to get it out - it comes out like a lump; (2) once on the skin - does work but I used alot of it; (3) I smell like coconut all day (which I like.) I will be using this up but once done, I don't think I will buy again. What I haven't tried is running the container under warm water. This may loosen it up. It does super moisturize - and that is why I got it. I bought this because it was on sale for $3.99. It’s just like how it is at the store. I liked that the container is the new ones and the scent is fresh. The butter is also very much like it is at the store. Amazon always have a good deal. I’d highly recommend buying on Amazon knstead I love The Body Shop products. Their products always smell nice, but never overwhelming. This specific body butter us moisturizing and soaks right in so it's not really greasy. I got three of these guys through a sale and was so excited to have them on hand for impromptu gifting! I have become sensitized to a number of scents and no longer use them. This works great for me and leaves my hands feeling soft and smooth all day, even though I only apply it at night before sleep. I enjoy the subtle scent and it is not a problem for me. I love this body butter! I went ahead and ordered 1 more different fragrance.I can't handle harsh perfumes due to migraines. They are so light in fragrance and do not make your skin feel oily. I love putting it on right after a shower. Because, it helps me relax. I love their options! It was smaller than I thought it would be, but it was still nice regardless. Ohh! Thanks to my friend, Laurie, I got this as a present for Xmas and I’m in love! This is my body moisturizer and ‘parfum’ lol. Love the scent and the moisturizer lasts and keeps my skin looking and feeling at its best.. It’s all I use now. Love Moringa Body Butter! LISTENNNNNNNN!!!!! When I say I couldn't stop smelling myself!!! Now I'll ADMIT I have excema and shouldn't even be using scented lotions or butters BUT ya'll I couldn't pass this up lol. Made my skin feel so soft and even my dog kept sniffing! Only con I myself noticed is the scent doesn't last long which is disappointing as with most stuff we buy but for the price,it's decent!"
239,B000F6RFX4,"If it weren't for the heartwrenching review by poor-hermit-who-rarely-left-the-house//dropped-out-from-school//life-was-a-wreck-for-years//finally-found-happiness-via-this-little-bar-of-soap: K.Uyehara's review.... I possibly might have thought twice about purchasing this product.Those ""miracle-drug-soap-cure-etc's"" just don't exist......... or do they?Apparently, as we age, life tosses you crap.Apparently, I've now 'adult-onset eczema' on my poor little fingers. It's painful, ugly, and costly. The so-called remedy cortisone cream thins your skin to the point that anything you touch leaves bruises. The tiny cracks & slivers of papercut-like skin lesions are painful.... lotion doesn't help and actually stings rather than helps - thus is painful when used. The 3-6 bandaged fingers daily are time-consuming, costly, and 'oh-so-lovely' to look at. The only help I've found is generic Vit E cream (not lotion) applied constantly all day @ work in order to keep my hands moisturized (and for some reason is not painful like lotion). While the Vit E cream helps some, it is in no way a miracle. My bruised & bandaged hands almost constantly look like a 94 year old's. My biggest thrill in life is that 1-2 week period when 'all has calmed down' and I'm bandage-less. My biggest fear is that (usually, at the worst opportune time) the outbreaks shall return.K. Uyehara talked me into trying this product.K. Uyehara gave me hope.K. Uyehara was right!THIS STUFF ROCKS my world!!!It nourishes, it moisturizes, it kills bacteria, it quells the pain, and more importantly - quells my outbreaks.I keep a bar right there by the kitchen sink and use it after every dishwashing and also for no reason at all. I probably wash my hands with this stuff 12+ times a day!!This little bar is a MIRACLE!!!Albeit, not a fix.... but miracle enough to give me much further times between outbreaks. And not only that... some outbreaks don't require bandaging with cort cream and Aquaphor.... they sort of heal themselves. You'll notice the benefits of this soap right away...your skin is NOT left feeling dried out -- it feels nourished and happy -- you won't even need lotion afterwards. I'm 1 month into using this product and can't even believe what this mud has done for me. It's done so much, that I'm back for more!!!Since I can't get to the Dead Sea, I've now brought the Dead Sea to me.......for this little bar of mud is the BEST mud I've ever experienced!!!!!(and perhaps the only mud I've ever really enthusiastically enjoyed)This little bar of mud has spoken so loudly to me that I've gone over to saltworksusa and picked up a 5lb bag of course grain Dead Sea bath salt. Soaking my feet in that is 'over the top' after a long day on my feet at work. And while the salt is fab.... this mud rates 10 stars above and beyond even it. Even a quick wash of my feet with this mud at the end of a day makes my feet feel 30 years younger and less used :)I've told friends about it - they've bought it and they absolutely love it!I've given it as gifts to family... they can't thank me enough!  (who gives soap as a gift? I do now! ;)I'm now back for my 3 more bars!I shall NEVER be without my Adovia mud soap!!!!It's now in travel kits, work locker, and 2 locales @ home.Thank you K. Uyehara!!!!Thank you Adovia!!!!Thank you Dead Sea!!!!Thank you all!!!==================================================02/20/2011 UPDATE:Sadly, it appears that those of us who take time to share a great product with the rest of the world has a nasty implication otherwise.While always a fear prior to writing a positive product review here, it appears that positive reviews 'bellow up' those corporate minds who sell these products and hence they decide to greedily increase their prices.In less than 1.5 months, the cost of this little bar of soap has gone up almost threefold. It was $7.99, sadly it is now $19.99.Perhaps it is a misprint? Perhaps due to the Middle East uprising at the moment?I could only hope.Misprint or not.... I refuse to pay my hard-earned money to such greed. I've found another brand and am ordering 3 bars from them. And even with those 3 bars, I am still paying less than today's one bar price from this seller.Try the Jericho brand folks!Haven't rec'd it yet, but if it is as this soap was - what's the difference in a name?I will update after receipt both here and @ Jericho's page.I absolutely refuse to pay $20 for a bar of soap. Funny how soap from the same origin can vary in price, even if due to the Middle East situation at the moment.ADOVIA//resellers ------- I sure hope you are listening!  ***********************03/17/2011 UPDATE:I am a busy gal... I've not much time for 'review writing', even moreso for 'updates'... but here I am yet again.Brief, I'll hope this time ;)1st off: It's nice to see that the price came back down (again, hopefully just a misprint prior). But it is exceptionally sad to see how my fears have seemingly proven correct. Too many postive reviews and the price went up (sure, other factors involved, but we all know that's not all to it). Twas $7.99 approx 1.5 months ago, tis now $9 something as I write this update.Something 'sick' has been going around @ work... caught it twice. This 2nd time, my poor little fingers seemed to respond to the 'daily stress of enduring life while sick' more than ever before. PAINFUL sliver-like papercut-like wounds brought me almost to tears at times.This soap IS STILL AND FOREVER SHALL BE MY GOOD FRIEND (I shall never be without it), but of recently, it has now brought only the smallest bit of relief and for a lesser amount of time. Soaking my hands in the 'also-above-mentioned' salt prev purchased has also been of help --but again only a short-term relief (less than 1 hour). Neither helped as it has before but thIS mud HAS AND STILL OFFERS A CALMING RELIEF (albeit only temporarily during outbreaks). The night I bandaged 8 out of 10 fingers before bed..... I'd HAD ENOUGH!!!I now offer this update only in the attempt to help others out there who are painfully living a life that 21st century medicine should have already helped us with otherwise......If I sound like you,if you are at your wit's end,if you're holding back the tears over excruciating painful eczema moments as I have these last 2 weeks,if you don't know what to do now and have finally relinquished yourself to spending half of your life's savings in hypafix tape, gauze/telfa, and cortisone cream....LISTEN ALL & LISTEN NOW...... again ---no miracle, but...Give this a try:DERMAREST Eczema Medicated Lotion(you'll find some of the best prices here on Amazon)Yep, at some time they'll raise the price because of the positive benefits of this product shared here on amazon.... but when utter pain becomes relief, who the heck cares when it can help the poor human who possibly can't live without it!?!Nope, you'll find no review written about it on amazon's product page by me this time around.... but if you found this, then you'll find that hopefully. I personally am keeping the secret safe this time around and allowing others to give it 5 stars elsewhere.The above-mentioned product is A GIFT FROM GOD.The initial application was a slight and somewhat 'sting', but settled down almost immediately. The 'sting' never returned and application #2 was less than 30 minutes following app #1.... anything to help the pain and THIS WAS HELPING THE PAIN! I had applied this stuff probably 4-5 times in less than 2 hours.... just hoping for (and needing) 'actual' relief (no itching, just PAIN).The relief slowly came.... I just kept re-applying it as I deemed necessary.The first night however, I still applied my cort cream and bandages...and then....Two days in and I found incredible relief/healing.Three days in and I was off to work attempting no bandaged fingers.Four days in and the big red welt on my wrist (how'd it go from only fingers to wrist?!?!!) was dissipating.Nothing has completely healed, I've still painful areas... but this outcome FAR OUTDOES any other I've found to date.YEP, I still bandage at night - but not to the same extent as before.Perhaps 2 fingers each hand (or less? depends obviously)... but I'm still a FAR HAPPIER INDIVIDUAL and less painful soul than I was less than 5 days ago.I now carry this stuff with me to work and then back home with me. I ignore the instructions and apply it as I SEE FIT. So far I haven'd died from 'over-application'. The healing in just almost 4 days time is almost what I might call miraculous (albeit not, but still a 'finger-saver') (not to mention a bandaging $$ saver at this point also).The tears too, well, they've been saved for another time.I'm back for 6 more bottles of this stuff.... for home, for work, for travel, for backup. I shall never be without BOTH my mud and THIS DERMAREST STUFF. Adovia Mud IS STILL EXCEPTIONALLY FAB, however not a longterm relief when an outbreak occurs. This DERMAREST Eczema -- egaaads, it's beyond the bee's knees!!! I've really no words for this stuff and am still thanking 'that above' for it. In fact, I'm only back here at amazon to order a bulk 6-pack of the stuff --and only 4 days into using the stuff!I just thought, that along the way --- I'd update my review here in order to include this info to other poor suffering fools like me and perhaps offer even the 'painfully-almost-in-tears' folks out there a second hope. This little bottle has changed my life in just 4 days.... perhaps it can for you too? We are all one humanity. If I can benefit from this little bottle of lotion.... then so shall the rest of you perhaps --future cost increase aside.Obviously, no promise, no guarantee to anyone out there... but when I compared the cost of the ER (with no real feasible relief offered in the long run) to perhaps another 2 weeks or so of trying whatever I could get my hands onto and hope for relief along the way (based only on reviews via the internet).... well, here I am, back again and babbling again, and hopefully offering a bit of hope otherwise to those of us 'infected' with this nasty and ugly condition.So there, whatever! - take that you corporate suits!!!Raise the price! Go ahead... I dare ya!We'll all know why when you do!Yep... you've a product that is exceptional, it sells, and better yet -- sells only to a few special folk in need! Why not gouge our wallets, you'll get richer and well... we'll keep buying what we must ----but hey mr suit - can you spare a dime? I've a family to feed and not much to feed them with.But on the upside mr corporate suit --thank you!You've changed my day-to-day life.While not perfect, and I've still somewhat painful lesions... you've offered me hope and hopeful healing!That oughta be worth a-meal-a-week-or-so out of my paycheck eh?For that, I guess in this day & age that I can't really complain.Please though... all I ask, is that you remember 'that I am not as rich as you' and never will be.While the healing properties may not last (they have so far with me; the lotion is medicated), this stuff DOES work, at least for me, and at least for today.I feel better, and the label ingredients have also talked me into taking Zinc daily (just in case that'll help too)Today is St. Patty's Day...I sip & toast to all of us suffering with this dreaded condition who may have perhaps finally found a possible 'help' to alleviate the pain accompanying our sorry state!Cheers and green beer to all! :)================================================================================================================== A few months ago I had an allergic reaction to a prescription and my skin was itching so bad I had to put tape over my fingernails or I would have scratched all my skin off in my sleep.  Dermatologist recommend this specific brand of soap.  It was like magic to stop the itch!  I didn't bother to rinse it off, I would just moisten my skin with water and rub the soap on and then leave it - the itch stopped instantly!The skin issue I had is long gone so I no longer ""need"" this soap but I continue to use it and my skin has never felt better.  I leave it on my skin - after a shower or bath I rub the soap bar all over and then get dressed.  It doesn't leave any smell or residue and my skin feels soft and hydrated all day!Don't get it in your eyes though, it stings. Just what I wanted Ok, so I've had problems with acne for a while... a very long while. Iv'e tried proactive, clean & clear, all that bs. I even tried home remedies (my little sister hooked me up lol). So after trying all these products and stuff it did show some improvements by clearing up what was already there, then a few weeks later BAM! Back at it again with a face spotted with redness and pimples.I'm the type of guy that HATES to keep putting on all these creams and taking care of my skin as if I were Americas next top model, so I did some research and found this; read reviews and felt convinced so I ordered it for myself. As soon as it came I've already had 2-4 pimples on my face. So that night I showered and slapped my face with the soap like it owed me money, I scrubbed for a good while and left it there till I was ready to get out the shower. I cleaned it off and did noticed that the pimples that were growing to be big mighty adults seemed to kind of dried up... a little though, not too much. I felt my skin and it was left very smooth, and I didn't feel any irritation what so ever.So three days have passed and the couple of pimples that were on my face since the product came are completely gone (after using the product for the three nights straight). There is very little marks of where the pimples used to be and currently I don't see any of them growing. I don't expect this product to work like black magic on my face, but I am pleased with the results after using all these other products for a long time. I work out a lot and my face is constantly sweating, plus I have long hair so that gets on my face too (this causes pimples, or so I've heard). Little by little I should expect for the product to continue to healing my face which has been suffering from acne for years and have battle scars with all the other products that I've used. So I guess until I'm done with the soap or till I feel like my face is similar to a babies butt cheeck, I will write another review on the product. Hope this helps.*UPDATE*Finally decided it was time to revisit the review. Well... it's honestly nothing special, but still pretty good. I have used a little over 25% of the soap already and my skin looks average, as in NOT SO MANY OR NOT SO NOTICEABLE PIMPLES!!!! Before you get to excited, there are downsides. This is NOT the fountain of youth. The scars from previous pimples have not gone, but have faded. This product, in my own opinion and experience, is great for people with oily skin; use it in the morning and have not so dry skin during the resat of the day. This soap is not the answer for the cure of pimples, but damn does it keep it under control. Iv'e used this product everyday and it has reduced the amount and size of pimples I usually had before I bought the product. What it seems to do is clean very well inside the pores of your skin and deep clean those dirty mother- at the source. My problem is like I said, I'm constantly working out and my face is exposed outside with plenty of pollution in the air and large amounts of my sexy sweat dripping down on my beautiful face :(. To finish this horrible review, I have honestly written this review with the deepest truth and a large effort because I know first hand how annoying pimples can be, especially when you're beautiful like me lol! All I can say is, buy this product as a VERY good face soap/cleanser thing and with hopes that it will reduce your pimple problems. However, you should try other products while using this one. I'm thinking into buying Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay (search on amazon) and/or Tepezcohuite (also look up). Hope this review helped you out, if you have any questions that have been unanswered, don't be shy and feel free to comment on my post and I will try to help you out asap."
240,B0001TQ9WI,"Seller rating is five stars for sure. Item arrived super quick and without any damage or leakage.I'd give Skin Trip ten stars if I could, because it is one of the best lotions you can ever use. It's the only thing I use to moisturize my entire body, including my face. I have replaced all of my specialty beauty lotions and creams with this one lotion. It really is a miracle in a bottle. It has limited ingredients which is important for my extremely sensitive skin. I have super cranky, ultra sensitive, breaks-out-if-I-sneeze sort of skin. I get compliments regularly how great it looks.Your skin feels velvety soft because it the consistency is thinner than a traditional lotion. Is spreads out evenly and absorbs ultra quick. You can add more if you feel like you aren't moisturized enough, but you probably will be, and because it's so light you'll never be left with greasy, clogged pores. I use it after sun exposure and literally for everything that needs healing. Coconut oil is naturally antiseptic, ultra moisturizing, skin protecting, and has a natural SPF of about 4. So it's great on nearly everything you throw it at. Can't tell you how many hundreds of dollars I save with the top four items alone. My regimen consists of:1) Clarisonic face brush (I swear by this--it will change your life for the cost of two good facials and all of the extra products to clarify, exfoliate, deep clean your face you will no longer have to buy)2) Dove bar soap (that's right, bar soap)3) Skin Trip Coconut Moisturizer on my face and full body.4) Baking soda for exfoliation (as needed)So that's it. No toners, no night creams, no peels, special exfoliants, wrinkle or eye creams. The only thing I can foresee is those in colder climates may need an additional heavier lotion or cream if exposed to heaters and the elements quite a bit. It gets pretty cold here in the winter, and I have found I end to reapply and more liberally than in warmer times. It still works perfectly just more is needed to retain the moisture for longer periods. Or I use pure coconut oil to give that extra layer or protection without congesting my skin.Tips for using Baking Soda in your beauty regime: Make a paste with some water and dip a cleansing brush in it or slather it all over with your hands and do a face and body scrub. It's super softening and a gentle enough texture to be used by anyone. I usually keep a plastic tub of it in the shower and just scoop handfuls of it and scrub away. Great for softening rough feet even if you feel like you aren't scrubbing very much. Soft feet secret: after your baking soda once over in the shower, slather on the Skin Trip Coconut Moisturizer generously while your feet are still warm, and throw on some socks over top. Do this before bed and wake up with super soft, rested tootsies in the am.Hopefully this review helps you and that you have the same amazing experience with this lotion as I have. Try it and I bet you will love it! I wanted something that had the scent of coconut, tropical, yummy.  After receiving it and trying it, I fell in love with it.  It smells yummy and tropical and like coconut.  My husband loves it as much as I do.  I am hoping I can use it on my face as a moisturizer as well as arms, etc.  I put it initially on my arms and found it just melted (perhaps a better word would be it absorbed into my skin, etc.)  No greasy feel.  I am a teeny bit concerned because there is a note on the bottle that says ""best when used fresh"".  I know not to freeze it or allow it to get ultra hot but not sure what ""fresh means"".  Will it last a few months?  weeks?  I do not see a date on it showing a Use by Date or anything.  Other than that I really do like thisAddition:  Have been using it a few days now.  Still love this stuff! I have been trying to see if I can be a bit more specific about the scent.  Yes it is coconut but I think I will add it gives me a feeling coconut/sun tan lotion scent.  That is what I was looking for.  Very tropical, very light sent too. Not overwhelming.  Have gotten several compliments and people asking me what I have on.  I am still amazed as to how quickly it resolves into my skin.  One other thing.  I do like the ingredients.  I am not an expert on this type of stuff but the first ingredient is Purified Water, second is Coconut Oil and third is Aloe Juice.  From there we get some things that I don't know what they are, but to be honest I don't care.  I like these ""main ingredients"", love the scent and love the feel.  It's a done deal for me. I had been using this product as a face moisturizer since the 1980s, but somewhere along the line they changed the formula, or I developed an allergy,  and it made my face break out. I DO have an allergy to fragrance on my skin, and facial skin is overly sensitive, so that may be why I had to stop using it as a facial moisturizer.  However, it is GREAT on legs & arms. As a senior citizen, now I have the typical ""alligator skin"" on my elbows and upper arms. I started to apply this lotion on my arms daily, and goodbye alligator skin!. And that dry flaky skin on my legs is gone after daily use there as well. It has a rich coconut scent that my dog wants to lick! I have to keep her away when I am applying the lotion, as the chemicals are probably not suitable for doggie consumption. Finally, if you get a sunburn, apply this lotion to the burn and the relief is almost immediate. Great product! One I can't live without! This is my favorite lotion.Skin trip is very runny.  It goes on light, absorbs fast, and doesn't leave you feeling sticky.  Because it has lanolin in it, the moisturizing is long lasting.  I have very dry skin, and this does the trick.The scent is very different on each person.  My husband uses it, and it smells light, hints of aloe and a touch of coconut, barely any scent.  My friend used it and smelled more sunscreen coconut, but a light fragrance.  When I use it, I smell like a vanilla cupcake topped with toasted coconut, and it is strong.  My husband will put the lotion on his hands, and touch my arm because he thinks it is funny that the scent so drastically changes.  While the scent is strong on me, it is not unpleasant, and I find people around me suddenly crave baked goods. I've been using this stuff since the early 1980's. My skin drinks it up, it smells great and moisturizes well!"
241,B0001ZA3Y2,"This is a great product to use for those who have to deal with eczema on their hands. It moisturizes and locks it in, making your dry hands feeling soft. This was recommended by my dermatologist. I've been using this lotion for well over a decade and love it. This batch had a slightly strong smell (like ammonia, too much urea or not well-mixed?) that I've never experienced before. Does seem a little thinner than usual, too. I don't like most lotions because they stay greasy too long, but Ulaction works perfectly. Highly recommended. Works great for winter time dryness! Great moisturizer for the money. UPDATE: Since I wrote this review I’ve discovered something cheaper and easier way to get rid of my keratosis pilaris bumps… Ivory soap and a nice washcloth! I’m serious! Just lather up and scrub your arms/legs and if you’re religious about it they’ll slowly go away, at least they did for me! Hope this is helpful for someone else… Oh, and PS the exfoliating brush made my KP bumps worse over time.Bought U-Lactin lotion for my keratosis pilaris on my arms and legs. It has been a miracle lotion! I use it after taking a shower, where I use an exfoliating brush (listed on Amazon as: Exfoliating Brush, Ingrown Hair and Razor Bumps Treatment for Women, Keratosis Pilaris KP Body Exfoliator Brush for Bikini, Legs, Arms) and then immediately apply U-Lactin while my pores are still open from the humidity of the shower. My KP isn’t completely gone, but it’s probably better by a good 90%. My arms are pretty close to 100% better and I only have a few troublesome areas on my lower legs. Definitely try this lotion before spending $$$$$ for other keratosis pilaris treatments! I use this on my whole body and it makes my legs so so soft and exfoliated!! It’s cheaper than other products and you get more for your money. Plus the ingredients are the same as other, and it also include Urea & Lactic Acid. I know some of these products don’t have Urea in them so that made me happy to see, because that’s a really good ingredient for removing keratin and retaining natural skin moisture. My Keratosis Pilaris is pretty much gone and I’ve been using this stuff for like 3 days. I definitely recommend it!Also for perspective, I have used AmLactin and while it seemed to work, it also made my skin prone to burns while in the sun, and my fair skin seemed to be susceptible to becoming irritated and pink. I have not had any skin issues with this product so far, and that’s with daily sun exposure. While it’s possible it might not be as strong as AmLactin, but it’s still quite effective for my level of KP.Anyways I hope you give it a try! And if anything, it’s definitely good for smoothing rough & bumpy skin! Okay, so I ordered this item on 04/07 and received it super fast (in two days) and began using it expressly by the instructions. Today 04/18/2014, I am absolutely AMAZED at what has transpired. I mean, I have struggled with so-called ""chicken skin"" (keratosis pilaris) on my upper arm/elbow, my thighs and lower back, since my early teens and even with multiple trips to dermatologists over the years and many other ointments, creams, lotions, potions, home remedies and the like, I decided to try this (largely in part to the reviews that I had read here), just as a last ditch effort. I must say, because I had so many other disappointing options, I was TRULY reluctant, skeptical, doubtful, to throw any sum of monies towards any more options, BUT, I did and I'm SOOOO glad I have done so with this product. While I realize that one product isn't the miracle cure for all, based on my experience in just ONE week and the multiple expressed experiences of the other reviews you may read here, I can unequivocally say that my monies and time thus far, have been extremely well spent. It is remarkable how much of a difference there is in my skin texture there is and the improvement continues, (IN JUST ONE WEEK). I will update this in another 3 weeks to let you know if I'm still as elated as I am now. If you are like me, and don't want to always resort to the sun to temporarily relieve this condition, (which would be much to the dismay of any dermatologist) give this product a try. It is well worth the expense, which I don't find to be too outrageous, considering the benefits. I hope this was helpful and I'll let you know in a few if I'm still on board."
242,B000T55RSG,"This was my first time using a self tanning spray and I really liked it! I’m typically a tanning bed girly but I’m opting for skin friendly solutions these days. This solution gave me a beautiful glow and didn’t make me look orange. Smell was nice at first but then next day it did start to smell like tanning spray solution just a little bit - but not terrible! It did get lighter after showering the next day but I did like the instant tan it gave me. Will definitely be purchasing more! I usually use bondi sands and wanted something more “easier”. With this you only need 1 coat, I put it on at night and waited until the next morning to wash off and it turned out so good. It doesn’t transfer onto your sheets either but I’d definitely recommend using it outside or putting a towel down when you do use it inside because it will be all over your floor. 10/10 recommend. i like the color a lot! The spray is easy, the color is fantastic, no streaking, and best of all there is no bad odor! I’ve used a lot of self tan lotions and sprays and this one is my all time favorite. Super easy to use. Totally covers my rosacea. Great color and well worth the very reasonable price I paid. I highly recommend buying and trying this awesome sunless tanning product! This is perfect in my opinion.  Easy to use, even coat, mild scent and easy to maintain.  Buy two! AlsoFor any dark areas or to clean cuticles or knuckles and ankles use Garnier micelualar water! It's like a tide pen for false tan! I LOVE using this when i’m in between tans, or when my face tan wears off! I love that it makes me more sunkissed rather than orange. It smells so good also! it’s instant but ofc no self tans are going to be perfect. i love how dark it makes you though and it’s quick you just have to rinse off and it stains your clothes"
243,B000FQUGXA,"no smell. very light. use it after i wash my face. sometimes use it on my body. universal product. must have at home. it doesn't replace moisturizing for face. but definitely great to use under it. I have quite dry skin, and I initially bought this for my face. I didn't notice a difference using this on my face, but I found that it works great on my legs. The skin on my thighs, calves, and butt gets SO itchy during the winter because of the dryness, to the point where it keeps me up at night because I just can't stop scratching. I put a layer of this on and let it soak in for a few minutes before I put my lotion on, and it's the only thing I've found that keeps the itchy dryness at bay (lotion alone just doesn't do it, and I've tried many different ones). I only gave it four stars because this is intended to be a face product and I wasn't impressed with it on my face, but I will definitely repurchase for my legs. I don't want to live another winter without it! this product literally transformed my skin and its effects are permanent rather than temporary as with some skincare products (i.e. once you stop using them, your skin returns to whatever state you were trying to correct).  please don't be warned off this amazing product bc of a few negative reviews -- from what i can tell, most of those reviewers are using the product incorrectly, are ignorant about hyaluronic acid generally, or haven't even used the product!here's my experience from almost two months using this product.i have very very dry skin that is somewhat sensitive.  before using hada labo, i'd been battling facial psoriasis that covered my entire forehead, around my nose, and a few spots on my chin.  i'd tried everything non-prescription i could get my hands on for two years, and right before purchasing hada labo, the psoriasis started creeping down onto my left eyelid.  i was frantic.after a few days using hada labo in my skincare routine (after cleansing, but before moisturizing), the psoriasis scales reduced in size/scope and after a week they began to recede altogether.  after using this product twice a day for about 2 weeks, i couldn't even see where the psoriasis used to be.  it actually surprised me and i had to ask my spouse to confirm what my eyes were seeing lol!  (for those who have never experienced psoriasis:  even when the scales/flakes are gone or temporarily exfoliated, you can still see a bright red patch indicating psoriasis-affected skin.  even with the best of the products i'd tried, these red patches were ever-present.)  i'm happy to say that my psoriasis is completely gone, leaving no trace it ever existed in the first place, and hada labo is the only product i tried with both immediate and long-term efficacy.  what i tell my friends is if it can disappear psoriasis, it can probably improve most skin ailments, as psoriasis is notoriously difficult to treat even with prescription products.i've now used it twice per day for 6 weeks on my face, body, and hair and i'm only just getting to the bottom of my first bottle.  i love this product for its results, but the icing on the cake is the price and amount needed per use.  i can't say enough about this product and will be repurchasing again and again.(note on usage:  i'm sure it's been covered by many other reviewers, but you use this product after makeup removal and cleansing but before moisturizing.  if you are on your exfoliating days, it should be after exfoliation and before moisturizing.  i put a nickel-sized amount in my palm, rub my hands together, and then *pat* it into my skin, making sure to get my lips, eyes, and neck as well.  i use the patting method with all skincare stuff bc it helps with absorption and you get more product into the places you need it.  there are a ton of youtube videos if you need detailed steps.) I'm 38 with fair sensitive combination skin and Rosacea.  I've been doing the Korean 10-step skin care regimen for about a month, once a day.  That has made a noticeable improvement in my skin.  The puffy bags under my eyes have reduced significantly, my skin tone has evened out, my cheeks are no longer as dry and my nose is less oily.  Fine lines have faded a bit as well, but were still there around my eyes and above my upper lip.  I ordered this acid stuff on a lark on the same day I ordered some of my Korean products, May 2nd.  The rave reviews and very reasonable price made it well worth the risk.  And I made sure to get the Japanese version.  I have used Japanese products before, usually with good results so I had no trouble believing the Japanese version would be better.  It arrived on June 19th.  For 10$, I'm not going to complain and it had the inadvertent up side of me being able to use it in isolation.  By now, I had a routine in place and I was only adding this one product so I could really see if it did anything for me.  It really did make a difference.  I'm have used it for all of four days.  I could see the difference on day two.  And I don't mean right after application, I mean hours later.  I mean the next day when I woke up my skin looked better.  The fine lines around my eyes were even better!  The lines above my upper lip, which was only a little better after a month of the 10 step regimen, are now markedly lessened.  My face looks 5 years younger, at least.  The lines around my eyes look like they did when I first noticed their appearance in my late 20's.  It's pretty amazing.  I would give the stuff a try, it's so cheap, there's nothing to lose by trying.I do not use the face mask type method others have mentioned.  Honestly, it's a bit of a hassle for me and the face masks tend to bother my eyes and make them water, even though they don't touch my eyes.  Something about the proximity to my eyes I think.  What I do instead is wash my face, use toner and them put about 1/2 a teaspoon of this stuff on my face.  Then I wet my hands with cold water and get my face good and damp.  I let my face air dry.  It takes about 5 minutes.  Once dry, then I do the essence, serum, and moisture steps like normal.  I had planned to make my own cloth mask for this product out of cotton or linen, but this is so effective, I don't know that I need to.  Seriously, give it a try."
244,B000GDDKJY,"I've been using this product for about 6 months now.  While I've found some great body washes & body scrubs for treating body blemishes/breakouts since those are used IN the shower, you are washing away the medicine & it can only do so much.  I found the washes to be more useful for treating existing acne rather than preventing it.  As much as I love the Murad & Peter Thomas Acne body scrubs/washes & they have definitely helped, nothing has been able to completely resolve my body acne, till this!  Even my dermatologist had gotten to the point of wanting to put me on Acutane.  Thankfully I just kept looking at products & found this before having to try Acutane.Pros:This product is a liquid, so you have great coverage, sprays upside down as well, which is useful for applying to your back area and doesn't stain your clothes.  It has a nice tingly feeling when you put it on & the salicylic acid continues to work throughout the day.  You will literally notice an improvement within 24 hours & more benefits with continued use.I have also noticed that my skin has gotten softer & smoother, which I haven't experienced from any other products.Cons:Little high maintenance because you have to wait 5+ minutes for it to dry before getting dressed.  So hopefully you can roam your house in the nude for awhile.When I first started using it (about 6 months ago) I would apply it daily to my chest & back after showering.  So I was originally going through a bottle every 1 1/2 months which was a little pricey.  But after using it for about 3 months, I now only need to use it about once a week!  If you've ever had problematic skin, you get to a point where you don't really care what something costs, as long as it works.  So while this was more of a hassle to me to have to order a lot, I can see it seeming expensive to some. I love this product but I hated paying $40 every couple months for it at Sephora.  Its nice to find it cheaper but I will say I worried about the authenticity a bit.  I saved my bottle that I bought from Sephora to comare the packaging and ever label, seal and stamp matched so I feel pretty confident that it is real.  The next test would be in how it works and it absolutely does!  Its easy to use and I love that you an spray it upside down so I can easily spray on my own back.  I will bend over at the waist and then spray it over my shoulder so it mists over my back and then can hold the bottle at different angle to spray any spots I feel I missed.  Within a day or two I noticed results and after extended use my skin looked great!  I don't notice it being overly drying, I think with products like this you have to expect some though due to its nature but I like that I can sort of tell it healing and drying up my existing blemishes and it prevents new ones.  I use it after I get out of the show and sometime before bed.  It only take a few minutes to dry on the skin.  I also use it on my 10 year old daughter who has started getting a few blemishes on her back and chest and its gentle on her skin and has cleared it right up.  It does have a medicinal kind of smell and depending on how much you spray it leaves a cool tingly feeling, I don't mind either but just for sake of full disclosure if those thing bother you. It all started about a month ago. I was bored, browsing youtube. Somehow I started watching videos on how to get rid of acne. Eventually I stumbled across a video that described this murad spray as basically a miracle. I was a bit skeptical then I came here and checked out the reviews. I was happy for two reasons. One, a lot of reviews say they bought this for 40-50 bucks, and I bought it for $25. Second, everyone said it works! Well, not for me.Let's start off with the good. The bottle is a miracle in itself. You can spray at any angle, and unlike other sprays, it really works upside down and doesn't start getting leaky and losing pressure. It doesn't smell bad at all, you can breath. Some products gives you a burning sensation but this one doesn't. This one actually makes me feel a cooling sensation, so that's interesting, however since it's winter, it makes me colder. But let me say this. The product didn't do ANYTHING for me. I think the only thing it did was lighten up my face a little MAYBE (I sprayed my face 2 times with this). Did absolutely nothing for my back and chest. I did spray a lot, and it didn't dry my skin at all. The product is pretty much empty, and combined I've used it for probably 10-15 days.But, had I not bought this, I would not have found out about another product. I came here to write a review a while ago, then read another users review, that basically wrote how I felt. It doesn't work. The user said he used 'Glytone' and I looked it up. It looked good, so I bought it. I have been using the glytone spray for 10 days now, and all the light acne I had on my body is GONE! The acne that has been on my body for 2 years, GONE in only 10 days!! a miracle. The darker acne on my body is starting to lighten up, and I'm sure it will be gone within another 10 days, and by the next 20 days, i'm sure my body will be spotless. I do use a lot of it though, 10 days and I'm left with 1/4 of a bottle. However, the spray is the same price as this Murad one, and has twice as much liquid in it, and is 4x as powerful. I couldn't recommend that product any more.Good luck in your acne battle A little pricey but worth it. As long as I consistently use on my chest, back and shoulders, everything looks great."
245,B000HX4JWK,"I have used this Cellex-C serum since it came to the market years and years ago... the early 90s.  I am now a senior citizen and my skin is still looking great.  I will not be without my Celle-x C. I have been using this product for two months. Jury still out on whether I can see a difference. The advice is to use it 2 times a day. And I only do it once. Curious to see if I add the second application I will see a difference. I'll update my review if I do. I will say it has taken off my top later of skin to reveal more brown spots. Maybe I need to double up! I am a 21 year old asian female with combination skin and struggle with a bit of acne and acne scars. I wasted so much money by trying out different pharmaceutical products and high end products to get rid of my acne and scars. I even tried using clarisonic but it was way too harsh on my skin so I had to return it. This product was recommended to me by my boyfriend; he told me that when he was getting his skin treated in Korea, the clinic used this same serum brand for his skin. (they used the advanced one but that seemed too harsh for my skin) After two days I definitely saw a difference. My skin felt like it was glowing. I never knew what people meant when they said their skin glowed, but now I think I know! After over a week of using this product, my acne scars have lightened, giving me hope that if I continue using this, it will definitely give me clear skin.It is important that you do not use more than 3 drops because this is very acidic, it will irritate your skin. I like to mix three drops of this with my SK-II treatment essence and apply it with my fingers, tapping it until it feels like it is absorbed.Bottom line, I highly recommend it. I went from no routine other than cleansing, and maybe using ProActiv at times to using the High Potency Serum, with the Hydra 5 B Complex and the Sea Silk Moisturizer in the morning AFTER using the Neutrogena Buffing Cleanser that exfoliates (thought I would create a better way for the product to get in and work).  I did this in the morning and used, also for the first time, pure Retinol 1.0 in the evenings.  After 3 days, my face became red and inflammed, burning and stinging, and nothing eased the pain.  Just had to wait it out.  It took about 4 days to settle down.  I've been putting the Cellex-C on the thin skin of my wrist and lower arm every OTHER day to check for allergic reaction..and testing the retinol on the other.  So far, so good.  After all I have read, I am still encouraged this is a good product.  Just a word of caution for others not to try to do too much all at once like I did. I have suffered from mild to moderate acne since stopping birth control pills four years ago. I'm 31 now and am tired of feeling like a teenager! I have very oily skin, too, and a few sun spots. I bought Cellex-C Vitamin C serum out of desperation. I feel like I've tried almost everything else. All I can say is WOW!! I wish I had discovered this years ago. The change to my skin was almost immediate, but after 3 months of consistent use my skin is 90% better. My skin feels soft and smooth and not nearly as oily. And I hardly get any breakouts anymore! This is magic in a bottle. It's expensive, yes, but worth every penny. Initially I combined it with the Hydra B5 serum, which was also great, but to keep costs down I decided to stick with the Vitamin C. It's still working like a charm. Highly, highly recommend! I discovedred Cellex-C a few months ago, and it was ""love at first sight"". When I applied it on the skin, my skin felt different from the first application onwards. I use it in combination with Cellex-C's skin hydration complex. Both products are available in two strengths. I use the lighter version of both products and consider them fully sufficient. Once I got a sample of the stronger version of the hydration complex, and it was too thick in texture.I use the products every evening or every other evening, depending on how my skin feels. The skin feels baby-soft and nourished - just wonderful.I have also ordered an eye care product of Cellex-C and will comment on that when I have started using it.If I had to sum up my opinion of Cellex-C in four words, those would be ""never again without it"". This order was not wrapped securely as glass should be.  Just put into a large bubble wrap.  A little cushion around the glass would be appreciated. I use this product every day and love it."
246,B0009VNI40,"Used this for added moisture in my boyfriends hair and it got the job done!! also great for after a wax or shave I like how it heals wounds and moscito bites sunburns ect I always keep Fruit of the Eart Vloe Vera Gel on hand, because it's so useful.Unlike many aloe gels, this does not contain added colors, SD alcohol, menthol, or lidocaine.  SD alcohol and menthol provide a cooling sensation, but can irritate the skin.  Lidocaine is what your dentist injects into your gums to numb nerve endings for dental procedures.  I have used gels with lidocaine in the past, and it does help with the pain, but it will not help heal the burn.  Neither will SD alcohol or menthol.If you have mild sunburn, apply this frequently, stay inside, and stay cool.  Fortunately, this product can be applied as often as you please.  If your sunburn is moderate to severe, see your doctor.I use this for minor household burns.  Two days ago, I burned my forearm near my elbow while reaching into a 425 degree oven.  Right away, I ran some cool (not cold) water over the affected area, and started applying this gel every couple hours.  I also used a good moisturizer and sunscreen; more on those products later.  The burned area of skin is now brown.  There is no redness, no pain or irritation, blistering, peeling, or scabbing.  The skin is perfectly smooth and the mark will fade.It's also good for an array of minor skin irritations.  Sometimes when I'm handling plants and gardening, oils from the plant cause a bit of an allergic reaction.  I'm not talking about poison ivy types of reactions here, just itchiness with or without redness, without a rash.  It's quite soothing.  It also helps heal minor cuts and abrasions, those tiny injuries that happen while cleaning house or handling office items.I've used it in a pinch as hair gel.  It has no film formers or silicones, so it doesn't add hold or shine, but the thickeners will add some body to my hair, which is great, because my hair can use all the body I can give it.For both men and women this is possibly the best aftershave product out there.  No matter how you remove hair, you may experience skin irritation.  Depilatories, epilators, electric, and blade razors can all cause rash or razor burn.  Gentlemen, please get rid of aftershave products and use this.  Don't use aftershave products or colognes containing alcohol or menthol.  No matter what you've been told, these products are not good for your skin.  You may think the ""burn"" is a necessary part of a good shave, but you're wrong.  A good shave is the result of good shaving tools and techniques.  Those products burn because they irritate your skin, and the more irritation you have from shaving, the more they burn.  Otherwise, this is the first thing you should apply to your skin after shaving.Use styptic powder or pencil, or an alum block to stop bleeding if necessary.  Then, men and women both, use this gel first thing after shaving or other methods of hair removal.  Aloe contains potent anti-irritants.  It will soothe your skin, and help ease redness.  After using the aloe gel, apply a moisturizer, such as  The most important part for me is that it worked wonderfully as a deodorant it kept me dry all day long no irritation at all now that’s all I use I love it Product is nice,  but the bottle is not as portable as I wanted. It was shipped in an envelope without padding and arrived with a broken cap. Fruit of the Earth has been around for, hmm, maybe 30 years?  I remember the first time I bought aloe gel it was Fruit of the Earth.  That was when aloe gel was the hot new thing.I have an aloe vera plant, too.  It's been growing about 20 years.  Honestly, I do like the freshly cut leaves better for burns and to help heal skin, but the plant has its drawbacks, too, primarily the fact that when you cut off a leaf, it's going to take time for a new one to grow.  And it can get messy, and you have to use it fresh.  The fresh aloe gel isn't really like a gel.  It's really more like extremely watery mucous.  I only use it for first aid, because straight up, the fresh aloe makes my skin feel tight.So, I did some research on the ingredients after I've used this for a while.  I noticed when I used it near my eyes, they burned a little.  It was nothing major, but I wanted to know what was up.  Besides aloe vera, this product contains, pH adjustor, thickeners, stabilizers, preservative (tocopherol), and anti-microbials.  I've no intention of writing a thesis, but my research revealed that several ingredients may irritate the eyes.  These types of ingredients are required for a uniform product with some shelf life, and protection from yeasty beasties.  So don't put it around your eyes, OK?I use it to calm irritated skin.  It's cooling on a hot day, and boy, it feels like heaven putting this stuff on your feet at night.  I use it to help wounds heal faster, and as an after shave/after epilation.  Sometimes I just put it on because I feel like using it.Though I do have the eye irritation that I have to work around, I recommend this.  I researched a lot of aloe vera gels on Amazon, and this is the best formulation I could find, bar none.  Please note this is not a food grade aloe vera gel."
247,B000IMJS0S,"Smells nice. Makes you feel super clean. I did notice a difference in my skin the first time i used it. My skin was squeeky clean after i was done taking a shower and once i dried off then my skin was very smooth, i followed up by using johnson and johnson's original baby lotion. Man I was so smooth i thought my clothes was gonna slide right off me. The scent of the soap is not what we're used to with the brand of soaps at the stores, it does smell like mud, but very subtle so i don't mind it. It seems like it will last a while because it is a pretty dense soap. Also, i noticed that it lifts the dead skin off your body rather quickly. After i first used it and dried off, i was rubbing the lotion on my body and felt skin rolling off my body, so gross but at least it's coming off. I'm sure that in no time, my skin will be where it's needs to be. I recommend that everyone try it at least once.- Ok so i have been using the soap for nearly a week now and i don't feel my skin rubbing off anymore, it seems like it got all the dead skin off and my skin is starting to glow. The dark skin under my armpits are getting lighter. I'm very happy about that, because i've tried the dove cleartone deoderant and it did nothing for my armpits. I bought this to help with a few small eczema spots that have appeared during my pregnancy.  Normally, these spots appear randomly during periods of stress and I spend 5-10 total minutes in a tanning bed to kick them.  However, being pregnant, that's not an option.  This soap was intended to help with the eczema and has not at all.Having said that, it's a lovely soap with a very foamy, smooth lather.  I like the soap and I like the lather.  I just wouldn't buy it again because I'm sure there are lots of smooth lathering soaps at Walmart. I used this a day or two before I realized what was so great about it. I did not really notice anything special as a body soap but as a face soap.. LOVE hat it tightens up your pours and makes you skin smooth and soft.  Best my skin has looked in forever.  I live in the southeast and recently traveled to Breckinridge Co. It was very dry there and I realized that people in a dry climate may not like this soap at all. I couldnt imagine using it while I was there as I was struggling to keep moisturizer on the entire time (which I never do). My skin type is normal and I try to drink plenty of water so I don't really know how oily or dry skin people would feel about it.  My guess would be, NO way for dry skin, perfect for normal and probably helpful for oily.  Will for sure reorder this. (Only negative is wish it was organic since I really don't know what the ingredients are.) I have been plagued with itchy, rashy skin for about 4 years now. It started all of a sudden, drs said I just became allergic to things. Well I went to perfume, dye free everything (almost). But still would claw myself to death after showers. I don't know if it was the soap I was using (dove) or if it was the water. Well I got this soap for me and my daughter (she has eczema) and I have fell in love with it! Not only has my itchy rashy skin stopped after the first use, but it makes my skin very soft. It doesn't leave a waxy feeling like most soaps do, and makes my legs feel amazing when I use it to shave. I had tried every lotion, soap, and cream out there. The rashes and itching would get so bad I would have to get a steroid shot. This soap has saved my sanity! I wanted to love this, especially considering how expensive it is. I loved the ingredient list and really thought it was going to help my skin. The exfoliation on the soap is really nice..but that's about it, The soap made my skin break out and I didn't feel any sort of improvement in the softness or overall quality of my skin even after using half of the bar. I just don't feel its worth the price. I would rather spend money on an expensive bath bomb. Best soap I use imo. Has gritty sand in bar so also gives a very light scrub. Just enough to accommodate all. Then the minerals seem to be just like Dead Sea magnesium salt. Seems to be a little more 'special' then your average epsom salt. hate the clean up... It produces a good amount of mud and an oil-ring on the bathtub that needs to be cleaned every time... So I love the soap, but have limited to using it just on my face, as it is too much maintenance to clean the whole tub twice a day :(  Other than that, it makes skin so soft as well as balances it."
248,B0001ZYL3Q,"This product didn't help me with the shingles pain, but it seems to have helped others. The smell is not bad at all. Just a slight weirdness which fades pretty quickly. I love how this is super moisturizing, and takes away all the dryness off of my skin! Have a toddler, now 2, who erupted in ecsema last year after HFM disease and eating lots of fruit. We can't exactly determine what is causing her allergy, so I spent the winter doing our best to tame it. Red all over, but with the classic crusty areas in the creases (backs of knees, etc).  The average OTC creams make her cry from ""tingling""; found a Borage oil lotion that is great, but really only keeps it from getting worse all winter, not totally healing. So here we are looking at cooler temps soon and she has broken out again (also letting her have some fruit) and I saw reviews for this product: TheraNeem. I read about Neem oil and how effective, but smelly it can be, so I thought for the price this was a good risk to take.  It DOES smell like vanilla, but you notice a twist of garlic with it.  I would never put this on my face (sensitive to smells), but have no problem putting it on her throughout the day. As long as you wash hands after applying, the smell otherwise fades.  Now onto the important part: I was shocked after putting it on the backs of her arms, which had erupted most recently in really rough bumps (like acne bumps). She had been scratching a lot, so it was enough for both of us to notice. I put the cream on one night and the next morning the texture was nearly gone. One arm was noticebly smooth, but red along one streak; that faded by the next day along with any bumps that were left.  I have used it all over her now, tops of thighs, armpits, backs of knees and it definitely helps to make it GO AWAY.  I wonder if it is the neem or the aloe, so I may use pure aloe on her one time to see, but this is the most interesting stuff I have tried so far. Requires only a very thin application.  It makes me think of the anti-aging creams that have retinol - acting like an anti-inflammatory or removal of a top layer of skin. I could see where that might be bad for some people, but it is working for her. Good This cream is a game changer. I live in a cold climate and a few years ago, seamingly out of nowhere (after having great skin most of my life, avoiding acne, etc.) my skin on my face became dry red and very flaky during the winter. I tried all types of creams and facial products on my own, then finally went to the skin doctor, where I was diagnosed with facial dandruff (Seborrheic Dermatitis). They gave me the facial shampoo and the prescription cream, and for many months I used it on and off (but per instructions), hoping it would work. I would use it, my skin would get better, and then it would just go back to red and flaky when I stopped. The medication was a skin thinner too so I didn't want to overuse. Anyway, I read online that neem products could help. I tried this cream and immediately saw improvement. After using for about a week my skin got completely better, and now I only use it when my skin starts to feel dry (so not every night). I'm not a big skincare person, so something easy and simple like this cream is perfect for me. Highly recommend!!! I am 59 years old and not getting any younger, but this cream has started to reverse the process of aging. Literally!! I have only used this Neem Cream for a few days, and I cannot believe the results I have gotten. My crows feet have diminished considerably, and my crepey skin on my neck has all disappeared. In fact, my neck was also sagging a bit and this cream has reversed that and my skin is now smooth and not saggy.at all.. I have tried countless other creams and have spent hundreds of dollars in the process. This wonder cream, by far, outshines all of the rest. I apply it to my face and neck at night before bed, and again in the morning. My face has never been softer and more radiant looking.As for the smell that many others have complained about: It has the scent of vanilla! It is somewhat strong, but not to the point that it is overwhelming, and the smell fades after a few minutes. In all honesty, the quality and overall dramatic result of this wonder cream, far out-weighs the vanilla smell. Just sayin........................!  Do not hesitate to try it yourself. You will not be disappointed with the results! For many years I have suffered from redness on my face. The last two years have been worse. I get it especially around my lower cheeks and believe it or not around my frontal scalp which is very itchy as well.  I visited my dermatologist who gave me a metronizadole which did not help me. As 39 year old male, I was never one for face creams but I was definitely looking for something to help. I was skeptical about TheraNeem even with such good reviews. I decided to order it. It's been about three weeks and I can tell you that this stuff works. While it did not totally eliminate the redness, it did make it barely visible and as far as my scalp the redness and itchiness have been greatly reduced. It does have a unique scent that may turn some people off to it but it only lasts for a little while and fades away. For the price it is definitely worth a try.Pros:Smooth texture that is quickly absorbed.Does not leave a residueYou do not need a lot, I use it only in my problem areas and dab it.Cons:Has a significant smell that is similar to vanilla scent trying to cover up something burnt. May bother some people.Small container for the price."
249,B0018ZMQE4,"This product is amazing! I had cystic acne as a teenager and was left with scars, hyperpigmentation and unevenly textured skin. Using the salicylic and glycolic combo has slowly started to even-out my skin and bring out a subtle glow! It’s a process… don’t expect results right away- but if you are patient, and consistent, you WILL see the improvements! These are strong acids!! Be very careful and read instructions thoroughly. Don’t pick at any of your peeling skin! It’s so tempting and hard not to…(embrace your inner snake and shed the past away!!) I usually peel for 4-5 days and do not use an exfoliator until the peeling is complete.Every time I use this product (usually once a month) my skin ends up softer, smoother, bright and so much healthier looking!This has been my favorite skincare product since 2014!!Great price too.. product lasts me usually 5-6 months! Ok so I'm an Esthetician and this was my first chemical peel ever. I am mixed and I have SUPER oily skin. I am 25 years old. My skin is so oily that it can saturate two Oil Absorbing Sheets no problem at the middle of the day and at the end. There were reports of people having their skin flake off and stuff. The only places I had skin flake off were on the driest parts of my face. The corners of the chin, upper lip, and the bridge of the nose. That's it! I will probably avoid these areas tonight when I do the peel again.Also, as far as the pain goes with this peel, I was able to withstand the whole time limit and even surpass the time. Maybe I just have a higher tolerance for pain than others.After a couple of days my skin was so much smoother and it made me want to run my hand over it a lot. That's how smooth it was. I could tell also that my skin was brighter. I have very acneic skin. I have had skin problems since I was 13. I have a problem with the tiny comedones (small bumps) everywhere on my face but especially on the outer cheeks and forehead. This was kind of emotional because for the longest time I haven't been happy with my skin. But I believe if I continue to use this peel that I can have normal looking skin. After using the peel I could tell that my skin maintained the radiance that my skin normally has and I think the radiance actually increased after using the peel.Today is day 8 after using the peel. I have some new breakouts of small bumps on my forehead but nothing drastic. My skin is in better condition now. I do have small red scars on my cheeks for past bad breakouts. I also have some hyperpigmentation from acne as well. These scars are looking better and I have only done one peel! Just imagine how my skin will look say after 10 peels or so!When I was just a teenager I used Tazorac cream, Retin-A, took Tetracycline orally, used Differin gel, Proactiv.. none of it really worked. This works for me. I used to wash my face with a face wash called Sal Ac. I think they disconitinued it or something. Anyways, now that I'm older my skin has mellowed out a little but when I break out it's not pretty so I am so happy that I found this.Long Live Beauty & Health,Whitney Read instruction very carefully and follow each step! My skin reacted exactly as described in other reviews and the instructions. The stinging/burning sensation was not intolerable. I wouldn't consider myself someone with a high or low pain tolerance. The discomfort from the first product increases a little after applying the second product. The most intense sensation happened when I first splashed the cold water/baking soda mix onto my face. Then it goes away as you continue to do it.I recommend making sure anything that touches your face (applicators, towel, bowl for water, hands, etc.) are very clean. Your skin will be vulnerable and could break out with what looks like large pimples without whiteheads because bacteria got on your face during the process. This happened to my girlfriend who used loose cotton balls she found in her bathroom drawer and did not wash the tupperware bowl or her hands.I kept to the exact time as listed in the instructions for my first application. My skin was tight for 2 days and peeled. It wasn't severe or embarassing. I didn't wear any makeup for the week starting immediately after the peel. And I was very careful not to touch my face. The moisturize included for free was fantastic! I order more for daily use during the winter since my skin gets very dry. It felt greasy but didn't cause me to break out.For my second and third application, I left the product on for 2 extra minutes. The discomfort was no different but I peeled a little deeper than before. I did all three times on consecutive Sundays evenings. After the thrid time, my skin had improved noticeably. After not using it for several weeks, the dark spots didn't return but the wrinkles seem to have.Very worth the money! I also used this as a test product to decide if a professional chemical peel would be worth the money/pain/peel. I felt it would be since my skin reacted so well to this mild version. I have loved everything I've ordered from Skin Obsession!!!! The seller is incredible to work with as well!!!"
250,B00005333G,"After what feels like 1.2 million years of roaming the perfect moisturizer for my skin dessert, finally it’s happen for me! The glow this moisturizer give my skin last allday , literally all day. I have complex skin my chin loves to break out. I use sea breeze for my toner and this to moisturize most of my face , not my chin. I finally figured out my chin is fine with just it being cleaned and the use of some toner . The break outs stopped . But the rest of my fave is giving hydration and glow, thanks to this moisturizer Feels great like a drink of water for my skin, but it feels like i need to apply twice. So in the long run ill have to buy more for the result i need, so ill keep shopping, but if you dont need as much moisture this is a perfect buy. I've been using this facial product for years and I just love it. It moisturizes greatly but is not greasy at all. It gets absorbed by the skin in seconds and leaves nothing but a smooth, beautiful skin. Very recommended! This product is ligth, and no smell I do not like the feeling of cream greasy, flower smellin creams and lotions.  All I want is a moisturizer, and this product do the job.  You can see and feel the difference in your face and neck. I love it. Already looking to purchase a couple more to put away for later. It feels super nice added to my skin care routine and omg y’all when I tell you it smells amazing I swear, it does. It’s lightly scented though, nothing harsh, I promise. Very fresh smell, not a florally scent. I’d say more like just fresh and clean scent. ♥️ I love them, i buy many good price good products for my skin I want to thank those that have written good reviews about this product or I would have not know how good this was. I'm 61 fairly any wrinkles and would love to keep it that way as long as I can. This product is light weight on my face were I can wear it during the day without feeling like I have a greasy face. It's a good amount at a great price. Ladies you won't be disappointed, just buy it! Will continue to buy."
251,B000FGS0RO,"It is exactly as described! I’d buy multiple of these if they didn’t cost so much. They rule. When I first opened the package I thought, ""Gross."" It felt weird and not in a good way. BUT, when I got it wet it felt wonderful on my face. The texture totally changed and it's soft as silk. I love it. So glad I didn't immediately return it before actually using it. Bought a second one. This is SO soft to the skin and removes makeup like a breeze.  It easily washes off makeup while being gentle to your skin.  I high recommend this product. It's the best on the market and trust me, I have looked around. I've bought it for friends who also love it. Like so many others, I bought this because of Angie on Hot and Flashy. I agree with all her other recommendations, but this one disappoints. I could not get all my eye makeup off using this cloth.It is in my view not nearly as soft or useful as the MakeUp Eraser cloths, which do an amazing job of getting off every last trace. Obviously these work for some people, but definitely not a win for me.Update after using for a week: I added a star to my review. Turns out the cloth needs to be used several times to start to work as advertised. I use a cleansing oil and now if I get the cloth totally wet and warm it will get my eye makeup off. So if you are someone who is disappointed with performance give that a try. I personally still like Makeup erasers better, but I can see now why some folks prefer this cloth. The Wonder Cloth is the only makeup remover cloth that I’ve used that actually works and lives up to its claims.  Soft, absorbent and rinses clean! This is the best makeup remover cloth I have ever used.  It removes all makeup, even waterproof.  Plus, it rinses out clean.  However, I do throw it in the wash weekly.  It lasts a really long time.  I love it. I like that I can see the removed makeup on the Towel and watch rinse away. Its soft and easy to clean. Wish I bought more than one"
252,B0015IW3PG,"Excellent product. Far superior to what I had been buying – for years – from Bath & Body Works. BB&W should be ashamed of themselves. I used to buy large amount of their hand soap, Cucumber Melon, which used to be foaming and excellent. They changed it to a “gentle gel hand soap.”  What crap. It is largely water, and you can’t get a decent lather no matter how many times you pump the bottle.  And the amount in the bottle last about 1/10 as long as the previous hand soaps from them. You do not want to buy from Bath & Body Works. They should be brought up on charges. Get this superb product instead, and at a far more reasonable price. I hope that BB&W hear my complaint. Their website failed to give you an opportunity to evaluate them. My guess is they really do not care. Works perfectly! Super value and I like the scent Just one pump is all the foam I need to wash off dirt, bacteria and viruses- if you know what I mean. Feels good. Smells good and I can get right back to touching stuff I shouldn’t touch. good stuff could be thicker or richer I had received a foaming soap as a gift and decided I had to get more.  Well,  I wasn't going to pay $7 for 1 bottle.  So I got the Dial at a great price and love the foam.  Foaming soap seems to last longer.  I use it on my hands and face. this is a good product i gave 5 star because its not a over powering smell for the scent just very subtle i dont like hand soap over powering smell  / and its a foam / the price was right with the purchaser and i am happy Love this product, using it in our bathrooms at work, great germ killing qualities and the scents are fantastic. If I would have anything bad to say is that I wish this came in a larger container, even at home it runs out very quickly."
253,B000VRTE9A,"Before you say it’s pricey for the size, you literally only need 2-3 tiny drops per application. This bottle will last me so long.  Its very thick and moisturizing. It healed pimples and dark spots i’ve had for so long on my face within a week. Did not break me out at all. I will buy again. Vitamin E is a great oil. I personally use it in a homemade lotion that I make. I think it is a great supplement for skin.I like to put the oils I use to rub on topically in roller bottles. I dilute them 1:1 when I put them in the bottle. It is then easy to pick up the roller bottle and use without having to go through the hassle of diluting it each time I use it. It also keeps the oils off my fingers so I am less likely to rub my eyes and get essential oils in them.I love to have them diffusing throughout my house and I think they make a world of difference when I have a cold and diffuse them in my room at night.So what’s the deal with the FDA and essential oils? The FDA regulates products by their intended use; Cosmetic, drug, both cosmetic and drug, or other like laundry soap. How does the FDA determine a products intended use? By the marketing claims made in the labeling, advertising, and websites regarding those products.So what is the difference in how a product is classified? If the product is intended only to cleanse the body, make the person more attractive, or make them smell better it is a cosmetic. Cosmetics do not have to have FDA approval before they go on the market. The FDA will however take action if they have reliable information showing that it is unsafe for consumers. If the product is intended for a therapeutic use such as treating or preventing a disease then it is a drug. If it is classified as a drug it must meet strict safety guidelines as well as have ample research done to prove that it treats or prevents what it claims to treat or prevent before being placed on the market. [...]So why is this effecting essential oils? Currently essential oils are classified as cosmetic which means companies do not need FDA approval to market and sell their product. So why not market essential oils as drugs and have the FDA start regulating them? It take around 12 years and costs drug companies millions in product research and testing to get a newly developed drug approved by the FDA.[...]If you think the price of essential oils is expensive now the price would sky rocket if essential oil companies had to pay to go through the process of acquiring FDA approval prior to marking their product.So what does that mean for us as essential oil consumers? I personally love essential oils and am in no way ready to give them up or pay triple the price for them.  It does mean however that we as consumers need to use them responsibly. Just as a medical doctor would never prescribe a patient a medication without knowing from experience or looking up the medication dose and route in a PDR. You should never use an essential oil for a supplement in your health maintenance without first looking up the dose and route in which it should be used. It is also important to know what contraindication or when you should avoid specific oils.I know that looking up information on essential oils can be hard to find especially with the FDA looking into essential oil companies.  That is forcing the removal of all information regarding the therapeutic properties of essential oils.  I personally have a book that I use to look up the dose and route as well as which oils to avoid based on my state of health. I know there are several books and websites out there with this information if you are using essential oils please take the time to look them up and use them responsibly. I have some bumpy skin around the under eye areA and dry skin in general- i put an ample quantity on my face - waited around 10-15 mins my skin just ate it up - next day my skin were soft and even - omg! Looked like korean skin! Amazing!! I received the Now Foods E-Oil 32,000IU damaged (the stopper was loose and some of the oil leaked out in transit) but I did order this product from Now Foods before; it lasted some time since I was only using it on my fingernails and feet (it's really thick so you do not need to use a whole lot of it), but I have to say although it is pricey for the size, it works well and goes a long way. It took the dryness and lines out of my nails and has made them stronger. It's a good combination of soy and olive oil, to be honest, with a little research and practice you can probably learn how to make your own product, and it could probably last you an entire year instead of spending 15.00 on a 1oz bottle that might only last a few months. If you do not have that kind of time on your hands though I suggest giving this particular product a try just keep in mind this is not 100% pure Vitamin E.Update 4/24/16: I have been using the Now Foods E-oil for some time now on my toenails because they were starting to develop lines, and were not growing as quickly as they used to (due to nerve injury and hormone imbalance), I have to say it has helped the health of my toenails but I have had to stop using it because I somehow developed a soy allergy and am trying to avoid soy as much as possible. Just a heads up for the onlookers, contemplating whether or not they should give this oil a try, if you have a soy allergy I recommend you avoid this product! This is a good product. I should've read the ingredients before I bought it, so that's my fault, but I've used the company before in the past so I didn't think to look. I'm allergic to soy, so I can't use it. It's Vitamin E Oil, who would've thought to check for soy? Plus, I thought this company was better than using such a cheap ingredient like soy. There's much better oils to use than that. I use this topically on my and my kids' skin.  I use it for minor cuts, rashes, and irritated skin.  I mixed it with some coconut oil and lavendar EO for use on ezcema.  I use a drop on my children's bums when they start to get a little diaper irritation.  I use cloth diapers, and so far this oil has not interfered with absorbency, but keep in mind that I'm not gobbing it on.  Just one drop will spread and smear across a few squares inches of skin.  I put one drop on my lips when they're chapped.  I'm a lip biter, and this oil is just bitter enough to keep me from licking my lips.  It's not bad, just not... delicious.  Has staying power.  The dropper works well.  Been using it for quite a while and I've only gone through maybe 1/6 to 1/5 of the bottle.  I use multiple drops per day.  I've made up jars of homemade lotion with shea butter, coconut oil, almond oil, etc, and I put a whole dropperful of this E in also.  I'm thinking about purchasing another to keep upstairs.Notice: This is not 100% vitamine E oil.  It has this listed on the label:Ingredients: 100% Natural Vitamin E oil (as d-alpha tocopherol from vegetable oil) and extra virgin olive oil.  Not a deal breaker, since I often mix it with a drop of lotion or oil in my palm anyway.  I'm sure this makes it go farther.  Just wanted to put it out there since I didn't remember reading that on the product description.  I'm glad it still is all-natural though. I had seen a lot of reviews saying the bottle was missing the dropper or it wasn’t sold to them as pictured. I’m happy to say my product looks the same as what was advertised."
254,B0002JG2NI,"I have low porosity hair. although most articles ,and YouTube videos suggest people with low porosity hair to stick to more light weight oils. I find castor oil to be the most moisturizing for my low porosity hair and it works good on eyelashes to . I recently purchased the Home Health Original Castor Oil in 8 Fl. oz and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The oil is of high quality and has a natural, mild scent. I have been using it to nourish and moisturize my hair and skin and have noticed a significant improvement in both. The oil is easily absorbed and leaves my hair and skin feeling soft and smooth. I also appreciate that the bottle is made from recycled materials and the company uses sustainable practices. Overall, I highly recommend this castor oil for anyone looking for a natural, effective way to improve the health of their hair and skin. I like the product because it can be used in many useful ways. It can be used on the body and in your hair. It’s value for money. I make my own skin moisturizer with this castor oil as the carrier oil and essential oils added to it. My skin glows and stays moisturized while also getting the natural benefits and vitamins of this organic oil on my skin. Sometimes I make a batch where this oil is 50% and something like grapeseed oil is 50% but I've been using this specific brand for years. I finally gave in and tried this product after researching and reading so many great things about it. I have been using it frequently and in multiple ways, and so far I really love this stuff. This brand provides a very nice product for a reasonable price. I have been massaging it into my scalp and hair, mixing it into my lotions, and buffing it into my face after cleansing with a cotton ball before bed. It makes my hair softer and shiny, and my skin soft and moisturized. It almost instantly got rid of my dry spots around my nose and eyebrows on my face, and has faded my acne scars. I haven't been using it long enough to determine whether or not it is effective for hair growth, but I am very pleased with the various other results I have gotten and will continue to use this product religiously. A little goes a long way, I use it for so many things regularly and I only need about quarter sized amounts for my longer hair and full lotion bottles, and a tablespoon at a time for multiple eyelash applications (to make sure I am not wasting a lot of product). I purchased the smallest size available and predict the bottle will last me well over six months. I have found various recipes online for a range of uses for this stuff and definitely recommend at least giving this a try. I believe it is a great alternative to expensive products and treatments for lots of uses. Obviously, with anything and pretty much everything, you will have to have patience and willingness to continue routines and experiments to find out what suites your individual needs. Sometimes things that work well for someone don't work for you, and it's a bummer when you spend $60.00 on some ""miracle"" product and it ends up not doing what it claims. I am glad I gave this a shot, I feel like it was worth the purchase and risk due to the inexpensive cost and amount of product. I was not paid or asked to write this review, or contacted by the seller in any way except for a default email offering services if I was unhappy with the product. This is my honest opinion and experience. I will purchase again when I run out. I liked that thee product is not a very heavy oil.  I find some other brands to be a little thicker. This oil is light not real greasy.  However when applying doesn’t absorb directly into skin, I massage the oil into my skin when applying otherwise your skin becomes a magnet for things to stick to your skin.  It does help protect and moisturize when you apply a serum or face product to keep sealed and hydrated most of the day.  I tend to be a fanatic when I see my face become less moist and tend to apply more of the product.  I am a 50 year old presently in menopause so for someone else that’s younger this product may not have to be applied as much.  The bottle is perfectly sealed but I would rather have a pump version then the pour out version.  But overall this is a very good product for giving baby soft skin but won’t get rid of wrinkles, dark circles, puffiness, scars or discoloration.  I did however notice is helps aid in preventing acne to a certain extent but won’t cure.  I apply a serum amongst a mineral moisturizer and apply this to prevent my skin from over drying to keep it hydrated and healthy looking.  But don’t lay directlyIn the sun with this on you will find your skin easily burning since it is oil.  I put it on but my exposure is minimal and not directly laying in the sun.  I workout by walking and running at the park so that’s how my face gets the exposure which it does redden up but I tan very quickly.  If you do buy this product you won’t be disappointed it’s worth the money just don’t expect miracles. I ordered this product a few years back and it worked wonders. The bottle was bigger and the label was more appealing imo. So far I don’t feel any effectiveness from the new bottle of castor oil. I don’t know if they changed the formula or not. I use this all over and especially my hair.  It does a great job.  I also use it on my eyebrows, of which I did not really have any before I started using this.  This is the small bottle which I buy every couple of years new and use it almost up then I buy the 32 ounce and refill the small bottle because it is easier to use."
255,B000052YM3,"I've only been using this product for a few weeks, but I can already see the difference! My laugh lines are completely erased and my skin feels super smooth when I wake up in the morning. 4 stars because the smell is unpleasant. But it goes away after about a minute as the product absorbs.Warning: this product breaks me out every single time I put it on. My skin may need more adjusting, so I will update this review later. But for now, I can only apply this at night because my face is way too red and splotchy from all the blood rushing to my face.UPDATE: I have been using this for about six months and have used about half the tub. I apply it generously about 2-4 times a week. Only at night, before sleeping. And, of course, I used a sunscreen the next day. I still love the way it makes me feel on the next morning and I've noticed a significant reduction in the number of breakouts I usually have. My wrinkles are also gone. I will keep re-purchasing this until I die. When I was in high school, I used the Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Treatment to help stave off some acne, but like most things around that time, I was flighty and quickly forgot about it.... Until I hit my 30s that is and was not only *still* working to stave off acne, but also began find wrinkles forming... What the heck?  Oily skin AND wrinkles?  I never got a break, haha... At any rate, I remembered this product my mother bought for me 15 years prior and figured I'd give it a try... What a change!  Quickly balanced my skin, and hands down, it has been the best for reducing (and dare I say, eliminating???) my wrinkles... Now, I'm not old, but years playing sports in the sun were starting to show... My eye and forehead wrinkles are not there anymore, and my mouth lines (my ""parentheses"" as I call them) are very faint now.  Again, I never had deep-set wrinkles, but even still... Been a loyal user now for the past few years. Oh, and I agree with other reviews, has definitely helped smooth out some scarring, too...I switched from the Oil Free Treatment (which is great, soaks in fast and easy to wear under makeup... This is a very cool product. I have dry skin, and I even used to have dry patches on my cheeks, which didn't look good at all, especially with makeup. This creme does make skin much smoother, and much fresher. It is not scented- it has a little bit of unpleasant chemical smell, but it's very faint, and you can't smell it on the skin (and I'm super sensitive to smells).It stings quite a bit when you first start using it, and my skin looked pretty red too, but that doesn't last more than 15 minutes. Also, the first week or two after I started using this moisturizer I started to break out a little- that is a temporary effect too. I guess, this is how this stuff works- that must be some sort of cleansing process for the skin. Now that I've used this for about a month my skin is MUCH smoother and is much more clear, I can even skip the foundation, but if I do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.I have been using Alph Hydrox nourishing cleanser with this. For daytime use, I apply just a thin layer of this creme, wait for about 5-10 minutes, and apply my spf moisturizer, and then makeup (sunblock is  a must after this product, cause AHA is an exfoliator, and makes your skin more sensitive to UVA/UVB). For night use if my skin feels dry, I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme (it doesn't contain AHAs).I'm not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don't have many, and I haven't used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.I definitely recommend this product, it's a great, truly effective creme, and you can't really beat the price! After five weeks of faithful use, I must say I am disappointed that this product doesn't work like the reviewers say it does.  I use it in conjunction with the AH 14% Serum.  The moisturizer is a moisturizer, so it does that, but as far as lifting or improving my trouble spots...nothing.  I am 36 years old, so I thought if I caught the problems early, I would be saving my skin in the long run.  I don't see myself purchasing this product again; it may be time to move on to something that will perform as I need. I've used this as well as Alpha-Hydrox's more expensive 12% 'souffle' and find they are both equally effective in suppressing fine wrinkles. The difference is the 10% version costs less and contains 2 oz, while the 12% version is only 1.6 oz and costs more. I guess you're paying for the word 'souffle' -- in actual look and texture, there is no difference between the two. I used the 10% for nearly 10 years, then switched to the 12% about a year ago. The more expensive 12% version worked no better than the less expensive 10% version. I'm going back to the 10% stuff.I'm only giving it 4 stars because I still think the cheaper version is more expensive than it needs to be. However until someone comes along with a less expensive product, it's still the best AHA buy around."
256,B0009V8N4U,"I like the product. So I liked the tan it gave but I smelled weird lol. It smells decent on its own but I don’t how it smells on me. I have been in the fashion and beauty business for over 20 years. I was trained in the art of hair and face by the first invasion of the British scene. Namely Vidal Sassoon's. I have personally tested over 75 self tanners. I ownd a salon that was recognized by Cosmopolitan magazine as being ""one of America's hottest salons"". My salon employed a number of tanning beds. I've owned personal self ran spray machines. In other words.... I know my s#%t.!!! Today's subject is a review on SUN... VERY DARK & SUN ULTRA DARK. Let me begin with this. There the same formula. One is no darker than the other. Confusing. First thing SUN should address.Now the product. In the 75-100 self tanners I have used, I've never rendered any product a 5 star review. I'm picky and firm.... and honest. I've used self tanners that cost between $4.00 and $80.00 dollars. No 5 stars yet. 1,2,and 3 stars make up 95 % of any product I have used.Again.... Now SUN.SUPERLATIVE. I'll keep it simple. I look for texture, fragrance, spreadability, moisture content, and economics. Then last of all I rate the color. Sounds backwards I know. But isn't.SUN is the nicest texture I have ever used. Jergens lotion has a beautiful texture also. But don't play consumer idiot. Jergens is lovely to apply, but is too thick. Manufacturers know this. Thick means usage of more product. More product means more sales. SON IS Much thinner, yet not at all runny. It spreads beautifully. Goes a long long way. Fragrance is gorgeous. Not overpowering cherry almond smell. Has a built in bronzer. You know where you have applied and what you missed. Works far better on faces than most. Common problem with self tanners is that they can profusely dry out the skin. I've been scared in the morning to look at my facial skin. Sometimes I've looked 10 years older from increased wrinkling. Also most self tanners play havick on age spots, liver spots, moles. They get overly dark. SUN isn't nearly as guilty of this infraction. Must use a glove or mitt as usual. Mitt better. Absorption is excellent. Bleeding issue is excellent, as in I'd doesn't. Sheet and clothes transfer exc. Economics exc. Buy the 32 Oz. Shop around before you do. Go for a bundle. My seller was very exc. Some problems with order. Immediately rectified. In finishing, I'll say this. The only reason. I did not give this product a 5 star rating is this. I found it fell slightly short in its darkening ability. When you coin a product VERY DARK OR ULTRA Dark, then you had better live up to that. SUN fails to do this. It no doubt will dork better for people as ith pale or lighter pigment. If hour looking for that dark Brazilian tan... this isn't for you. One of the greatest self tanners I've ever used. A SOLID 4 STARS. If they'll listen to me, twill be a 5 star product. Only one I would have ever used.Also.... forgive me, I forgot earlier to mention.... This product has a very neutral base tint. Not olive, and thank you Lord.... NOT AT ALL ORANGE or overly warm. Natural looking. Thanks for you time. I don't have much luck with sunless tanners. I'm very pale and I don't like the health risks associate with tanning in the sun. I've tried many popular drugstore brands I wouldn't go back too. I've tried Jergens Natural Glow, which was my favorite of the low budget variety. It gave nice gradual color but the smell disgusts me so much that I never end up using it for very long. I read glowing reviews about Sun Labs, so I decided to take the hit on my wallet it and give it a try. Keep in mind I only bought a full size version of this product, and not the accompanying scrubs, lotions, etc.COLOR:The color is fantastic and gives you a very realistic tan, even if you're starting off as pale as I am. It's the most realistic ""quick"" tanner I've used, Jergens being the most realistic gradual tanner. The color seems to have an olive undertone instead of orange, ensuring more natural looking bronze skin.APPLICATION:The lotion is darkly tinted so you see exactly how it's applying. Take note that if it looks uneven during this time you had better fix it or else it will end up looking just as bad once it sets. I still recommend using a bit of white lotion mixed in a drop of this stuff for your rough spots like knees and feet, or else it may end up soaking too much color as with most tanning lotions.A note on the dark tint: the tint is there to help you apply, and serve as a visual. It also helps you look much darker. Once you take your first shower after using the product, you will appear much lighter because the tint will wash away. So don't be afraid if the water turns dark brown and you look much lighter after stepping out. Personally I like washing off the dark tint as soon as possible.LONGEVITY:If you make sure to exfoliate properly before using, it will last a few days. To avoid looking splotchy and to make sure it comes off evenly, you have to continue exfoliating well every day. While this means it wont' last too long, at least it doesn't fade unevenly.SMELL:The main reason I stop using self tanners is because of the bad smell all tanning chemicals have. There seems to be no way around this. Sun Labs has a lovely smell when first applying, smells like cherry, but after an hour or so the perfume fades and the typical self-tanning smell arrives. It's much more subtle than any other tanner I've tried, which is a huge plus. However, it's still there. I have sensitive smell and I get very self-conscious when I smell it and usually stop using the tanner for a while. It's even worse when I go to the gym. A lot of people have had good luck with the smell, but there is a risk it won't work well for you. If this is a determining factor, I suggest trying a sample and going from there. I can only use this product every once in a while before the smell defeats me and I decide being pale for the summer is better than smelling weird.OVERALL:Three stars for being one of the best options out there right now. Great application and color. Average longevity. Smell is the most subtle from what I've used, but is still there and bothers me enough to be turned off from using it after a while. If you're desperate for something that looks natural and is easy to use, give this a shot! Just beware if you're sensitive to smells. By far the best i have tried…and easiest. I feel like the price keeps going up though and i do not know why. May switch to something else"
257,B000B5UPF4,"Have used this for years. It works great for my very oily skin, but I do reapply after 3-5 hours depending on the weather. This is the absolute best of the oil absorbing primers,best for those that are oil producing big timers,a little bit goes a long way-this lasted for half a year,this is worth a try if you're sick of the end-of-day oily face fear Works fine. This is truly a miracle product for those with super oily skin. I have been looking for something like this for 10+ years now and this the only thing that has worked for me. You can wave goodbye to your oil absorbing sheets!! Have used this brand for a while and it never disappoints.  Lasts longer than most - 4-5 hours - especially on really oily skin. Let me start off by saying my skin is way past oily, it is greasy. I’m 55 and have been dealing with this since I was 14. Dermatologists have been telling me it will slow down for the past 40 years. What a lie!  I’ve tried tons of products, but nothing comes close to this. Most have lots of silicone in them. This feels like a regular moisturizer going on. I use it over an actual moisturizer (reversol for oily skin. Excellent line of products too). As some people have pointed out , makeup doesn’t ‘glide’ on as easy as with other mattifiers, but wow! The makeup stays on all day. My office is 75-80 degrees and I’m away for 12 hours from the time I apply it til I get home.  My skin still looks great when I get home. I wear surgical masks or n95s most of the time in the office (questionable health status of coworkers) and there’s zero makeup transfer on the inside of the mask. I VERY highly recommend this. It was a dermatologist that recommended it to me and I’m so happy she did. Well worth the money. I love this gel.  I have tried many-many other brands (cheaper and more expensive) and always came back to this one for one reason - it makes my face look mat. I mean it makes my skin less oily (although there are few other lotions that do the same) but it also has a huge benefit - my face looks mat after I apply it so I don't need to cover it with powder to get rid of the shine (I had this problem with lots of mattifyers). I does control shine but it also looks mat on your face.  And I would even add that it visually whitens my face - another words, it might be a good primer for some people. If your face color is good in general and your only problem is oily skin, this product may make you look fabulous. Maybe little bit of loose powder and that it's. But it doesn't fill my pores or fine lines.The product itself is not cheap but ... I couldn't find anything more affordable and as good as this gel. It gives me about 6 hours of no shine which is more than anything else.  No rush (but Ia m not an allergic), make-up applies easy if you let it dry for few min and it doesn't cake afterwards. Although there have no improvements with my acne like some other people told.I am really happy with this product but I wish it was more affordable. One tube lasts for about a month (using it twice a day).The reason why I gave this product only 4 stars because recently when I purchased it online (as I have been doing it for about a year) for some strange reason I received another product (mattifying gel, white-purple tube, the same brand). First time I though it was just a mistake but then it happened again, and again, and again. I tried to contact the seller directly by email or phone and ask why, but always ended up talking to the Amazon Customer Service (which btw has been amazing).  Both times they issued full refunds and let me keep the wrong product which was kind of nice. Not sure if there is a difference between the original (what you see on Amazon) and the one that I get but if i buy something - I expect to receive what I pay for. So I am a bit frustrated... First off, I was skeptical.. I had some doubts.. I have really oily skin (not severely oily skin), but I kept asking myself.. is it going to be enough to control my oily T-zone for me? I was unsure if this product was really going to work to keep my shine down.. And the price was somewhat killing me.. Then I thought what did I have to lose? I had to give this mattifying oil control product a shot, so I did.. And oh my goodness, it works for me.. Thank the good heavens above. The annoying oil shininess on my T-zone is CONTROLLED, and I don't have that glossy slick anymore.. I kept checking every hour and the shine is definitely controlled, and not very visible; only very very little shine for me after several few hours 5+ had passed, but that is very acceptable to me and it has improved my looks by A LOT. I took a picture of myself after 8 hours, and the oily shine was only very little visible that it is not much noticeable. So far, so good. I definitely look much more BETTER without all that shine! I'm getting more people looking at me longer and more heads turning lol. All I can say is.. Yes!! No more blotting papers, no more going to the restroom to wipe off the oil on my face, no more worrying about taking pics with your face full of grease, no more feeling down, no more avoiding bright lights from above, all of that is NO MORE.. I'm just soo happy I found this product. Giving this product 5 stars. Works well for a guy like me.If you have a average oily T-zone, then give OC eight professional mattifying gel a try, you'll not regret it, I'm sure. I highly recommend it. I don't recommend it to people with serious extremely oily skin though! You might be disappointed as the people who gave 1 star reviews on this product; but hey, give it a go maybe it'll work? If not, oh well! It was worth a try, right? Just contact customer service, and let them help you out if you aren't satisfied."
258,B000J3ZMQA,"Nubian Heritage Coconut & Papaya Soap, 5 oz. 6 pack. This is one of my favorite soaps & I have come to count in it as my sort of, 'base soap'. It is mild enough not to irritate my sensitive skin, yet it has awesome exfoliation due to the little pieces of vanilla beans & what I believe are coconut fibers in it. It doesn't really smell like papaya or vanilla & the hint of coconut scent is minor, (if anyone was wondering). It is pretty mild & is an excellent neutral soap with moisturizing ingredients. (Just be careful with it on your sensitive bits until you get used to the texture of this bar). I use this as my main body soap & then add different organic body washes for scent, depending upon my mood. I really love Nubian Heritage products. I have tried most of their soap scents, as well as several of their body washes & lotions. I have been using this brand for about three or four years & I only wish that I had found it sooner! I was relieved to find it on amazon recently when my regular place was out of stock. This is one of those items that is a staple in my house & I don't ever want to run out of it. I tried to show the bar up close so that people can see the exfoliating bits inside. If you found this review helpful, kindly click the 'Yes' button below. Thanks! I love Nubian Heritage and all of their soaps I have tried so far. The coconut and papaya soap smells delightful and I had ordered a six pack via after catching a whiff of it in my local Central Market in Shoreline WA. I tried it in the shower after it arrived and although it smelled refreshing and bright, my legs needed an extra rich body butter after my shower instead of the normal post bath oil I normally use after I wash with NH's shea or black soap varieties. I continue to use this as a hand soap only and my guests have commented on how pleasant smelling and nice it felt to use. Next time I will try a different variety by Nubian Heritage (although I might have to get the coconut papaya body butter if they have it just to use it with the soaps I have left!) but overall for the price I I paid online I am very satisfied with this product. Love this brand.  A supposedly (hopefully) completely natural line of soaps that give lots of suds.  The smell of this particular one is very nice, not overwhelming, just right.  I have tried most of this extensive line and like most of them,but this is definitely one of my favorites.  Some of them (I think one that has rose hips in?? or maybe the carrot and pomegranate??) I don't particularly love because you wind up with dark bits of the soap (the natural plant parts) left lying on the shower floor.  My husband's not so good at making looking around to see if stuff gets washed down the drain so.....  But the soap lasts forever and ever and ever.  It's pricier than store bought soap, but well worth the price because of how long it lasts besides the fact that you can understand every ingredient on the label.  I've tried many other natural soaps, but this one is brand is my very favorite.  I doubt I'll ever try another - why bother, they have a huge selection so no need.  I have used this Coconut & Papaya along with several other scents of the Nubian soaps and other products, such as the lotions for a few years. The soap has a clean fresh smell and both myself and my husband use it.  It doesn't dry out and has a nice lather, as well as exfoliating factors.  You feel CLEAN without feeling like you are covered in chemicals. My guests always ask me ""where did you get that soap??""I have used it in a pinch on my face, but I wouldn't recommend it for daily use on the face, as the exfoliating pieces would be rough and drying.I have purchased these at Whole Foods, Wegmans, and various online shops.  This is one of the best prices out there. I have sensitive skin with slightly dry texture.  I used DOVE bar soap and body wash for so many years, as it was the only soap out there that did not aggravate my dry skin and eczema.  Lately, though, I have been switching to natural products and stumbled upon this at my local vitamin store.  This is simply head and shoulders above DOVE soap.  Not only does it lather beautifully and smell pleasant, it leaves the skin squeaky clean with no harshness or greasiness.  I have never felt my skin feel so clean and clear after a shower.  I now use it to wash my face and have not had any breakouts.  The effect is fantastic.  There are much more expensive soaps out there that advertise as natural, but still contain synthetic ingredients like titanium dioxide.  This soap, on the other hand, is 100% natural.  Highly recommended. I never thought I would love a bar soap like I love this. Most bar soaps leave me dry and itchy over time. This soap has the most creamy suds and leaves my skin super soft. Although I love coconut, I was afraid the smell might be overpowering, however it is a very delicate scent that goes with a variety of my perfumes. I had used the honey and black seed soap as well and liked it very much but this is the one for me. I purchased the 6 pack! If you have dry or sensitive skin, I highly recommend as the exfoliation is natural from the papaya and there are no added fragrances. I waited a few weeks to post a review as I really wanted to see how this soap performed.  First opening the box, the coconut and papaya smell really came through, it was faint yet refreshing.  After using it in the shower, the scent practically disappeared.  It's extremely hard to smell anything, which is alright for some, but for me I enjoy smelling that clean scent.As for performance, the soap lathers well and was smooth, not too rough on the skin for the first few uses.  Once the soap is worked down a bit and those thread like pieces of papaya (I guess?) start poking through, it was like rubbing sandpaper all over my skin.  The soap is extremely harsh, too much so, and left red marks along my body.Comparatively speaking, I absolutely love Nubian Heritage's African Black Soap.  It's not as harsh against my skin when worn down a bit; it has just enough exfoliation.  The scent also does not fade like this coconut and papaya soap scent does.  Needless to say, I'll be going back to their African Black soap."
259,B000N2O2PE,"I’m very fair and the fair/medium color is way too dark. It’s more medium. I use it as a spot treatment before bed and it works really well. I have only used last couple of days but it has already shown me its worth. It burns slightly when you apply to acne spots but it is the best full coverage and LIGHT non-cakey concealer I have ever used! It's coverage is phenomenal. It has dried up 2 big acne spots I had on my chin and made them half the size in 2 days alone. Best investment ever. Amazing covers up so good AMAZING AMAZING  AMAZING Amazing drying agent for pimples and zits. Blends in well with the skin and doesn't irritate. Only downside is the smell. It has a strong chemical smell that doesn't go away over time. The smell is irritating enough that after an hour of wearing it, I got a headache. This stuff is awesome!! I originally bought it because I thought it was acne medicine that I could wear all over my face but that is not the case. It is just a spot treatment that goes under your normal foundation. I use this as spot treatment where needed under my normal foundation and it matches perfectly. It’s a nice extra layer of protection to keep my acne out of view and to get rid of any acne at the same time. My skin hasn’t been this clear in months! I have tried everything from proactive to different prescription acne medications and this has been more effective than all of them. I absolutely recommend!!Update: Don’t mind my terrible faces in these pictures but I posted before and after pictures so you can see how effective this acne medicine really is. I went from 5 really yucky zits on my face to clear skin in a couple of weeks and my skin has stayed this way for months since then. Helps with my acne. I was so impressed with this after receiving it yesterday that I bought a backup.  What surprised me is that it is an amazing concealer.  I have spots I don't want on my lower arms and also bug bites that nothing conceals satisfactorily.  I tried this and it took two seconds to cover them 100% and then the lotion disappeared completely.  It also dries almost instantly so I don't know why other reviews said otherwise - humidity, maybe? Great dupe for Mario Badescu. Works like a charm and stops a zit in its tracks. Also super easy to blend under your makeup!!"
260,B000NN3H86,"Great product, feels clean afterwards and doesn't drive out my skin.  Also it's easy to use, just dab your cotton ball on top of the lid.  Perfect! I’ve used this product for over ten years. It’s a great toner and I won’t substitute! I use it to keep my facial skin clear and smoothe I started a new skin care routine about a month ago. I am 44 years old, fair skinned and dark hair. I started to see some really deep wrinkles ""11"" between my brows, and lines around my mouth, forehead and facial folds from my nose to my mouth. I am to the point of considering botox and fillers. I am a little strapped for cash and botox and fillers are expensive and a little out of reach right now. So I read up on Glycolic acid peels and other products. I purchased 50% Glycolic acid peel and started using once a week at home about four weeks ago with good results so far. It is important to use toner before applying the peel to remove the oil. So I found this glycolic toner and also a glycolic cream from the same company. I am using the toner and cream twice a day after I cleanse. This toner pulls more dirt from my face than any other toner I have used, it works great to prep my face for a chemical peel. I am using much more facial sunless tanning product than before because the twice daily use of this toner which really removes the old dead cells so well, that the sunless tan fades very quickly, but that is something I am more than willing to deal with for the fresh face the glycolic products give me. My wrinkles have become less apparent with the new routine and I have been only using for 4 weeks. I also use Hyaluronic acid under the cream. I am using all these products as a routine so I do not know how this will work alone without the other glycolic products...I will be buying this again and sticking with it for the long haul. My face feels like a baby's butt and my make up goes on a lot nicer an I use a lot less foundation for coverage than before. AquaGlycolic, now Mederma AG, was recommended to me by a dermatologist over 10 years ago.  At the time, I could find it a local pharmacy in Philadelphia.  When it changed to Mederma AG; i had to search for it and luckily found it on Amazon.  I am now menopausal (I'm 54)  and my skin is drier than ever before, but I still use this after washing my face at night to make sure i'm super clean; because i still break out by nose and chin (Thanks to Mast Wearing!  Ugh!)  I follow with a good moisturizer and I keep my skin pretty clear.It is confusing that the bottle says ""Advanced Dry Skin Therapy""; but I figured whoever labels isn't good at speaking English.  It should read ""Advanced Therapy for Oily/Combination Skin""; but I don't work for Merderma!  LOL.  . I have used these products for many years to clean my face before bed and have found them to be effective, cleansing, gentle on skin, and pleasant. I am devoted fan. My uses this product and liked it. I like to keep it short and simple. I have blackheads all over the tip of my nose and the area between my nose and cheek bones. I followed the directions, applying it once a day with a cotton ball to my face, moving to twice a day after the first few days. Simply place the cotton ball over the top, push down a single time and hold for a few seconds, then apply it to your cheeks, forehead, and nose. Doing this, the blackheads on my nose have reduced in size and the ones everywhere else have become very faded and mostly unnoticeable unless you look very closely. In short, my face has cleared up quite a bit and I'm happy with the product.I rate it 5 stars because the product did what it said it would do. It didn't remove my blackheads, but it cleared up my face and reduced their size dramatically. The blackheads on my nose are still bothering me despite their reduction, so I will be looking into another Aqua Glycolic product to target that area.Bottom line: my face is much cleaner and feels much softer and smoother after using this product."
261,B000EEZAXO,"great product. I love this soap it doesn't dry my hands out like others I have used. It has a clean fragrance. Lathers well. I like the price. Good value for money I love this soap! Only thing I would say bad about it is the dispenser is a little hard to push down on for soap to come out. Could have been that I got a bad batch of soap bottles. The soap product is fine, pretty much what I expected.  However, the dispensers (namely, the plungers) are horrible.  They are very difficult to operate, do not work smoothly, and fail to evenly dispense the soap.  I had to pirate some dispensers from empty containers of another soap product and modify them to work in the Method containers.  This was sufficiently annoying that I would not purchase this product again in the future. Method Gel Hand Wash in Sweet Water scent is really great for a frequent-use hand-wash. The Sweet Water scent is very mild, neutral and barely noticeable and the closest to fragrance-free in the Method hand washes. This is a great six-pack, for both quality and price.  Sweet water doesn't have foaming or sudsing agents, making it (chemically) a lot better for you hands. The soap is gentle on the hands, even for someone like me who washes their hands more than ten times a day. Personally though, I would still use a hand moisturizer in drier cities. I'm in California and tend to end up with very slightly dry hands with most other soaps I have used, this one just leaves my hands a little dry.The bottles themselves are super attractive and adorably shaped like a water droplet - they look pretty just about anywhere. I use these everywhere now, including the kitchen, bathrooms and laundry. I'm not overly eco-friendly (guilty), but it's always nice to support something eco-friendly, I love that these bottles are made from 100% recycled material, are non-toxic and never been tested on animals. For less than $4 a bottle, I'm very pleased with this product and buying in bulk really saves money. I'd definitely recommend it. Yes This was my first time buying Method gel wash. I looked at a lot of fragrances but I wanted to try something different than lavender or pear etc. Although I didn't know what ""Sweet Water"" meant or smelled like I figured with a name like that you can't go wrong.I'm so happy I got it I can't really describe the smell, but it is a light fragrance with just a hint of sweetness but not over-powering. I would say it is appropriate for men and women. I am using it in the downstairs powder room so everybody has access to it and I haven't gotten one complaint.Because it's clear it goes with any bathroom décor and the footprint of the bottle takes up very little room.The most important thing is it does not dry out your hands at all. It is gentle enough that my 22 month old granddaughter can wash her hands with it.I like it enough that I am going to buy the refill pouch."
262,B001F51T3Q,"received as advertised, good product, fast shipping thank you I like it because just apply once in the morning after shower it keeps my face fresh. My sometimes dry, sometimes oily face loves this moisturizer. The smell gives me an instant Marylin Monroe pose posture when I put it on. Skin feels soft.  Love it! No video Using this for many years, could not find anything more effective while being very gentle Fast delivery while keeping the price normal. I didn't receive the complete order.  I received on box of Olay.  The description says pack of two.  Please explain."

264,B000PKYCJA,"I began using Dermalogica products about a year ago and I really like them (I used to use Estee Lauder skin care).  I like them so much that I give them 5-stars. My complaint is that when I purchased this item about 3 months ago, the container felt too light, as if it were almost empty. I thought I was imagining things however I WAS surprised when it ran out so soon. I mix this product with the Dermalogica Serum  (both in their ""Age-Smart"" line) as a night time regimen, so I thought it should have lasted even longer.I am ordering again and am hoping that this bottle has more in it (and the last bottle was somehow ""shorted"" at the factory). I don't mind paying for quality however I have had products of a similar nature last me over 6 months - not 3. Love this face cream The product arrived on February 4th, I didn't even use it that night and there were several days that I didn't use it either, and yesterday February 23rd I'm going to apply my cream and I realize that it's over and I say how is it going to be possible That this was over when I only applied a very small amount and apart there were days that I used other creams to make that one better because it was quite expensive and I had to give it up. It seems unfair to pay so much money for something that lasted so little. Right, I give it three stars since I don't like that the bottle doesn't let me see the amount of product it has. It's a good cream but I won't buy it again. Finally found one product for sensitive very dry skin. Best part fragrance free. Don’t like that it’s in a pump so don’t know how long it lasts .  Definitely more than happy w results on skin Love this moisturizer!!! This moisturizer is incredible. I’ve used it now for over a year and results are everything I could want. I used this for the 1st time last night before bed. It felt like SPF going on…. Very sticky-thick and white on my skin as first. But then it melted into my skin gradually and felt absolutely amazing. Unfortunately I woke up with very puffy and itchy eyelids! It looked like I had been crying all night. I don’t usually ever have skin sensitivities, so I was surprised I had this reaction. I washed my face really well but the swelling and itch didn’t go away until I took 2 Benadryl. Unfortunately I have to return it. I say it’s unfortunate because the skin everywhere else my face was dewy and incredibly moisturized even after a night of sleeping on a flannel pillowcase. Such a bummer that I had that strange reaction. I've spent a fortune on my face. Facelifts, lasering...so I don't care What a beauty product will cost. All the facelifts in the world will not make a bit of a difference in skin texture or moisture retention. If this is a knock off I don't Care :) I've tried countless moisturizers of any price. Doesn't matter what it costs and this one is perfection. Plumps out the skin making pores about invisible. I Always give a moisturizer ten minutes to soak in before primer & makeup of course and this doesn't effect my primer or makeup application in any negative way. Put this on a night and see a transformation when you wake up. But like I said, I use this after my morning washing routine and applying makeup is not negatively effected. Even my makeup looks better with this under it. I'd started to think my good youthful skin was going to be a memory. Nope! Just the wrong moisturizers. BTW, this is over Half the cost of what I'd been using so to me it's a Deal!"
265,B001E15III,"I love this oil and it’s a forever part of my hair routine. I have tried Everything. This is so far what has been the nicest to my giant, fluffy, frizzy head. There is also a flower inside the bottle that almost tricked me into thinking it was something nasty, but it wasn’t. Just a flower. Scent of the oil is ok. I love this authentic Monoi from Tahiti.  My favorite, and arguably the best, is the Tiare scented.  A little goes a long way in moisturizing your skin.  You can also put just a little in your hair after showering, and it adds a healthy glow.  As mentioned, be aware that it will solidify temporarily if the temperature goes below 70F/21C.  I just set it out in the sun for a few minutes and voila, it's liquid again.  Otherwise, just put in under warm water.  I don't recommend the microwave for warming it up. Smells amazing Great I was skeptical at first. However I used it the other day and my hair was soft and smelled amazing. A little goes a long way! I used the usual large amount and it was too greasy. Made my hair feel heavy. When I used a little, my hair appeared dry, was shiny, and smelled amazing. This is my new staple. I can tell I’ll have this tiny bottle for a very long time. Wife loves it It works wonders on hair. Especially if you're a curly or wavy hair type. It controls frizz and even defines. Provides a great healthy shine, not greasy or heavy at all either. And the best part it smells beautiful, it reminds me of being in Hawaii. The fresh plumeria trees every where. Definitely a staple in my hair routine now. It’s very hydrating oil."
266,B001G7PPNI,"I bought this originally because I am a) on a very tight budget and this is reasonable in price, and b) it had good reviews on every site I went to.  I've used Jergens (and despised it, because the product broke me out and I am NOT acne-prone); BE Faux Tan (overpriced and underwhelming); St. Tropez (which I love but cannot currently afford for the amount I go through during the spring and summer), and a few other products over the years that probably aren't even made anymore.  One was from Avon, many moons ago.  I would say overall, this one really is the best.  Even if I had the money to go back to buying St. Tropez, I probably would not do so, although ST gives a bit more brown and natural a tan once the color is well-established.I am fair-skinned with a cool undertone (pink/blue), have turquoise-blue eyes, and dark blonde hair.  I don't mind my pale skin in the fall and winter, but come spring, this is my go-to product for a faux tan.  I do not use this product to the point where I will look like a Brazilian babe.  It probably COULD get me that dark, but in the past I've found going that dark to be very odd-looking with my natural eye and hair coloring.  This product turns me from wearing the very lightest and cool- or neutral-toned (never warm-toned) foundation sold into a medium-skinned lady, and very quickly at that.  So that you have an example of the skintone difference- Revlon Shade 001 PhotoReady Foundation, typically not available in stores because it is such a light shade that few people wear it, is what I have to buy normally.  If I don't allow it to dry an hour or more (and I often don't), I may add a drop or two of Revlon SkinLights in Bronze to Revlon's PhotoReady Shade 006 Foundation to up the ""bronze-y"" factor.  If I apply two coats in one day, it will turn me truly ""tan"", which for me means I'm wearing Revlon's PhotoReady Shade 008 Foundation.  If you are not starting out with über-pale skin like me and/or you are sunning outside regularly, you'll probably get quite a bit darker.Re-applying will depend on how dark you want to stay, how active you are, how dark you are to begin with, how much you bathe and/or sweat, etc.  To stay what is, for me, really tan, daily re-application would be required, twice daily on the face (yes, I'm that pale).  I'm fine with staying in the medium range, though, and so the following is what keeps me in that skintone.  I find that I must re-apply this more often on the face, tops of my feet, and my hands.  On my face, I typically apply it once a day, prior to applying my makeup in the a.m.  Because the hands are washed more often, then of course this will fade a bit faster on most people there- for me, it means I re-apply it every two to three days there.  The tops of my feet also fade more, probably because I work out daily and the friction of my workout shoes and socks rubs the product off somewhat.  While on the body I can get away with once a week application, the tops of my feet also need retouching every three days or so.I bought three bottles back in early April.  It is now the end of August, and I'm using the third bottle that came in April now.  This is with daily use on the face and one to two times a week elsewhere- so I'd say it lasts awhile!  Considering the cost, that is very impressive.One thing I ADORE about this product is how little it transfers onto clothing, sheets, towels, and other such items once it's allowed to dry on the skin.  Most self-tanners I've used leave a terrible amount of bronze coloring on pillowcases and such.  Not this!  Again, for the price that is incredibly nice.This product does have some drawbacks:1) The smell while it's drying and for several hours afterwards on the skin.  I don't notice any bad smell out of the bottle; only once it's sat on the skin for a bit.  If you just use it on the face (which I do almost daily, and it never breaks me out or clogs my pores), the smell is hardly even there.  But put it all over, and you'll detect it.  Have the perfume and scented deodorant ready!  It's not the worst I've ever used, but it is especially harsh on application day, and can make me a little self-conscious if I put it on the day of a big event or a date.  I do not notice it the days after application, though.But that said, I've never had any complaints from anyone about the scent of it when they're around me, so maybe it's not bad.  I do know it is FAR better than Bare Escentuals Faux Tan (which is far more costly and fades much worse than this), which was so bad that the second any water hit my skin (shower, swimming pool, etc.) the fake tan product odor became INSTANTLY apparent!  Talk about nerve-wracking!2)  The fade can be patchy.  Again, not the worst I've seen, but it's not the best.  I'd say that St. Tropez's self-tanner was the best-smelling, had the most natural color, and faded a bit better than this.  However, it is FAR more expensive and doesn't get me as dark nearly as fast as this does.  It also doesn't dry as fast as Banana Boat's, and wears off A LOT more on sheets and clothing.3) If not completely dry yet (as in not already on the skin SEVERAL hours), it will stain your towels and such when you dry your hands after washing.  It does stain my towel a bit at night after I've removed my makeup and washed my face, but then I do apply the Banana Boat tanner daily to my face, so I can't complain too much.4) While I like the look healthy and glowing in this, and everyone else who's seen me in it says I look great with it on, I cannot say it is quite the same as a natural tan.  I do not get the, ""Where did you go to the beach?""-type comments with this very often.  I try my best between this and my makeup to make it look natural, and I get very close, but I know it's not quite like a real suntan.  It is a bit more medium-toned, a tad more orange, and not quite as natural-looking as a real tan on ME as a real tan would be.  (This may not be true for those with a different natural coloring to start with, though.)  The closest to that real suntan look which I've found is to apply St. Tropez's self-tanner, with a tad of BE's ""A Little Sun"" sprinkled on the skin for that red-brown touch on the shoulders and other places where the sun hits the heaviest.  However, that look costs a lot more to obtain!  This and my current makeup gives me more of a look like the fitness-buff ladies get in Oxygen magazine.  It can't make me look like Christie Brinkley in ""National Lampoon's Vacation""- I wish it did! :DI hope that this review will help other fair-skinned souls out there if they want to buy this or not. :) I am Irish with fair complected skin and I burn when I am in the sun or tanning beds, I try to avoid this like the plague and I know that it is much safer to fake and bake with lotion....I have used a few different self tanners throughout the years (the cheap ones and the more high end) and I have been using Banana Boat Summer Color Self-Tanning Lotion, Deep Dark Color, For All Skin Tones for the past year and that is the only stuff that works for me on my very light fair completed sensitive skin... it gives me a tan where I look like I am Brazilian vs. IrishI did venture out because I had heard such great things about the ""Fake and Bake"" brand and heck the price was right at $13.30 a bottle regularly $42.74 a bottle (Yikes). At any rate, foolish me.... I tried ""Fake and Bake""  and what a mistake!!When I got it and applied it, I was really disappointed. I did the the proper prep work IE moisturize, moisturize, moisturize a few days prior... Shower, exfoliate, shave, completely dry off, put my hair up and apply with the gloves.HOLY HECK that stuff was messy and dark, it actually scared me to the point I had to call my husband in to help me apply it as quick as possible. His exact words were ""honey this stuff is a nightmare, I sure hope you don't wake up disappointed and looking like a train wreck And I think that you need to stick with your Banana Boat""The dry time took Forrreverrrr with ""Fake and Bake"" too and when I was finally able to go to bed, I slept a full 8 hours and woke up ready for a shower. When I took my clothes off, my clothes were stained and the color completely came off in the shower. - What a waste of time and money... No one has time for that!Lesson well learned.... Stick with what you know works and don't try to recreate the wheel!More about Banana Boat - Bedtime is the best time to apply...Banana Boat works well on my face too, pull your hair back and apply a dime size and let dry. I always moisturize on my off days and then I shower, shave, exfoliate, dry off really well and apply (rub in well) and let dry for 10 mins. Once dry get ready for bed and go to sleep, 6-8 hours later... shower off - it takes two-three separate applications to see a really nice Golden tan but you know it is working after the 6 hour mark from 1st application. Keep in mind... Slow and Steady Wins the Race with this stuff, but once you're there... You will be VERY happy :)Once I have a really nice tan -  I use this product faithfully every other night IE. Monday, Wednesday, Friday taking the other nights off to moisturize and exfoliate to avoid build up etc.I ALWAYS apply it at bed time so it sets in longer and avoid any smell in public. And I always shower, shave and exfoliate BEFORE applying. ALSO.... if you are not going to use gloves... wash hands in-between applying, I always start with the top half of my body (wash hands / dry) and finish with my lower half(wash hands / dry) and apply a small dime size on your wrist and work in putting your two wrist together and gliding it across your top hands etc until dry. - this helps with evening your tan out.You really cannot go wrong once you figure out what works best for you and the price cannot be beat considering this self-tanning lotion offers the same quality tan that other high end self-tanners do, but better!Best of Luck,~ SkyLee :)"
267,B000YBZIAC,"The price is just a little higher then l thought for a bar of this size, but all in all good value. When I bought this soap I was looking for a less costly brand of charcoal face cleanser -- achieved! One 150g bar can be cut into two normal sized pieces, or shaved into smaller bits. Your hands will gain enough lather for your face in seconds, which makes this an incredibly long lasting soap, and much, much easier on the wallet than other popular brands.As an unexpected plus, I recently found out that this soap is less chemically toxic than any of my previous cleansers, including the popular brand of similar soap I had sampled. In my personal opinion, it also works better for my specific skin type.What some consumers might not take into account is this product's combination of charcoal AND clay rather than just charcoal. It not going to be perfect for everyone. I recommend this for combination skin that is prone to imbalance, probably not for those with chronic, true acne, or skin that breaks out due to over-dryness ... but that's just a guess on my part and it's really up to each individual to see what works for them. For true combination skin, I can vouch that it's great.My perfectly clear (though combination) skin suddenly got unmanageable as an adult, for what reason I've never been able to fathom. Nothing I did worked. I was constantly washing my face, moisturizing, trying a combination of new products in new ways ... I even had a doctor once ask me if I washed, since it was apparent I didn't have true chronic acne. I ran across this product by chance and it's worked for me. I only wash my face with product once outside of a shower instead of a few times a day. I use a skin appropriate moisturizer afterward. I do not use this over my entire body, since my body itself tends towards dryness and does not have a breakout problem. For that I use something with a bit more moisturizing product and less clay (imagine the feeling you get directly after a clay mask and you can imagine using this soap).DO NOT get it in your eyes. It hurts like nobody's business. It's easy not to, just be aware. Wash it off well. If you don't, you get a tight, itchy feeling like you've improperly washed off a mask.Enjoy! Overall, I really like using this soap on my face. It lathers well, is unscented, and leaves my face clean without overdrying.I am a 30 y.o. female who in the past 2 years has been struggling with moderate acne flare ups (as are a lot of other people, I'm finding!). I have, like all the others, been trying EVERYTHING to get rid of this crap and make my skin beautiful again, but I still get pretty nasty acne - mainly on my chin and around my lips. I finally decided I would try to go the natural route and stop using all these chemicals.Anyway, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks, and I don't think it's either helped or hurt my acne thus far. Perhaps if given another week or so, I will see a change. Time will tell.I have never had an issue with large pores, so I can't comment on whether or not it minimizes them. One thing I can comment on is that my t-zone was getting pretty oily for awhile, and I do think that something in my 'regimen' has helped with that.Currently, my 'regimen' is (listing this so you can see what else I'm doing in addition to this soap):A.M. - Wash w/ this soap, use Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil pads (think they help w/ acne prevention a little), spot-treat zits w/ tea tree oil, spritz on Burt's Bees Rosewater & Glycerin toner, apply Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, and my makeup (trying to go as oil-free as possible w/ that).P.M. - Wash w/ this soap, apply Bragg's Organic Apple Cider Vinegar topically, spot treat w/ tea tree oil, spritz on the rosewater (see above), and moisturize. ALSO... every other day I am using Aztec Secrets Indian Healing Clay, which draws all the nasty gunk out of your pores & makes your skin feel radiant.I have just begun the straight up vinegar topically, but I did the clay mask & vinegar last night, and I think I see some minor improvement today.Moral of the story, I WOULD reccommend this soap & really like it; I'm just not so sure about the acne healing properties just yet. But good luck to ya! My wife loves this soap So I have used everything under the sun and under the moon and any where else they sell acne cures, but seriously I have bought everything on the market. The best thing I found was the African black dudu soap it worked well but I would still have break outs every so often. I figured hey this stuff is the best I could get. Then I decided to try this because I know charcoal is a natural detox. In fact, it is in every hospital and they use it for people who are poisoned. I tried it and WOW IT WORKED OVER NIGHT!!!! my skin cleared up and after continue use BAM ACNE FREE!!! this is it! this is the cure for me. I know people have different skin types so I cant say it will work for you. I have really oily skin and have been breaking out ever since 9th grade. I would say its worth a try because it is my acne cure and works better then anything I have tried and like I said I have tried everything!! I even read a couple books and tried their methods and all the natural remedies as well. The only other things I would recommend is Queen Helens mint face mask that is cheap and works great whether your using it for acne or just for minimizing pores/getting great skin. So keep it healthy and try it out! It made me acne free and happy as can be. I saw some reviews saying the bar lasted a long time. It only lasted about a month for me. That's not too long but I am re buying it ASAP because I have been a couple weeks without it and i'm starting to break out again. Thank you amazon for prime cause Im getting this bad boy in two days and will continue to buy and be a happy customer for life! if you have any questions or comments be sure to let me know cause I would love to share the good news of this life saving soap! Thanks"
268,B00014EH2C,"EDIT: My original review was five stars, but I have to revise it to four because this stuff gives me amazing quantities of blackheads, and little bumps that look as though they'd like to be pimples. It greatly improves the texture of my skin and I love, love, love how soft it makes it, but apparently in the long run it has pretty high breakout potential. I will revisit it in the winter when it's drier, but for now....four stars.I am in my early 30's, live in the desert, and transitioning from never taking care of my skin to trying to hold on to what I've got left from my 20's. I've tried tons of creams and lotions but nothing that works perfectly - if it's moisturizing enough, it makes me break out; if it doesn't make me break out, it makes my skin dry. Nothing with dimethicone goes on my skin, and the ingredients for this cream pass muster for me. It is also the ONLY natural skin cream I have ever tried that doesn't need to be applied a million times in a million layers to make my skin feel hydrated.  I only apply it at night right now (monsoon season, our humidity is at its annual high point), but I can see it being a go-to day and night cream in the winter. I wash with alaffia's coconut oil scrub and then put one layer on my face, neck, hands and elbows. I put one more layer around my eyes since I wear a sleep mask, and that's all it takes.This stuff has changed the texture of my skin - it's smoother, brighter, and has a dewy shimmer to it that I haven't seen since 25. I also started using this when breaking out fairly bad (for me), and even after the first night there was a big difference when I woke up - red spots were less red, and things in general had calmed down considerably.  The verdict is still out on whether or not this causes blackheads, but so far I've seen none.I can't believe the price of this cream - I'm going to order a couple more and keep them in the fridge in case it goes up.  Stop paying too much for expensive creams with s*** ingredients, and give this a try!  It's The One. I have been using this night cream for many years.  Really nice, not greasy, good moisturizing.I got a facial at a spa that I went to years ago where they used it - and I have been buying it ever since.I use it every day.  My adult daughters love it too. For years I've been trying to fight my face acne at the young age of 24, and this past year I was on an escapade to determine the best product out there for my skin. I was always jealous of how other people's faces looked so radiantly clean and beautifully free from acne. But now I think I've found the answer!Hydration creams really can be a remedial solution for acne prone skin, especially when your skin is not getting the nutrients it needs. However, this apricot intensive night cream is just about for anyone who has overly dry or acne-prone skin. I've tested several other hydration creams from Burts Bees and Avalon Organics, and I think this is truly the best. Application of this night cream by Earth Science is so easy where just a little dab of this stuff really goes a long way. The jar lasts for about 3 weeks (depending on your usage) if you use it consistently every night. Once you apply it to your face for the night, your face will stay moisten & hydrated well until the morning and ready for you to start your day. No need for a second application.Wash your face with Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser and apply this cream, and you'll see healthier skin in days! The best part that I love about this 2-step system: it's really simple and they're both eco-friendly products. No need to dry your skin out with artificial benzoyl peroxide!Also for those that are struggling with acne, sometimes a change of habits is in order. I didn't realize this until I forced myself to stop picking at my face, which I saw a rapid improvement in my face in less than a week.  So stop picking at your face,  wash your face at least 2x as recommended, and, you'll see results that you've been awaiting! Livestrong.com has some good acne maintenance tips. I like this product because it leaves my dry skin feeling well moisturized without being greasy. I've been using this product for maybe ten years or so, not just at night but in the daytime as well. It works well under my foundation and blush, actually. Recently I purchased one that had more of a fragrance than in the past, so I called the company to find out if there was anything wrong with it--I thought maybe too much fragrance had gotten into a particular batch. The person who took my call explained that the cream had been reformulated and the ingredients are now slightly different than before. I was skeptical, because it was such a great product already, and I was afraid they had ruined it. However, now that I've been using it for a few weeks, I feel like it's now actually even better. The texture and smell are a little different, but the smell does not linger after you apply the cream and it is a pleasant, apricot scent. I'm in my late 50s and I really think that this stuff, along with a healthy diet and exercise, is keeping my face from getting wrinkled."
269,B000I1OYNK,"I can not believe how well this worked!  It is amazing.  I am 71 and I couldn’t believe how dried up my skin has become.  I put a very small dab on the back of my hand.  It felt honey like (a little sticky).  I wish I had have taken a before and after picture, but I wasn’t expecting the transformation to happen so fast.  I gave some to my husband as well.  He had the same response.  I can’t wait to see my skin in a week.  I think it will be amazing!!Oh, and it isn’t sticky after rubbing it on.  Washed my hands, and it stayed on through the soap and water.  Thank you little lambs. I discovered lanolin did wonders for my lips when I was breastfeeding my first child. The popular brand I used forever changed their formula so it wasn’t as thick. This stuff is so thick. I apply at night and it is mostly still there in the morning. Except in the dry winter months I don’t have to apply any extra during the day. This is a pretty large tub and will probably take me years to finish My hands get so dry and chapped to the point they burn and look like the are 110 years old. My fingertips start splitting too!  I have spent so much $ on all kinds of products that didn't solve the issue. It's a bit tacky and has a faint odor that has grown on me.  (Probably because I finally came across an effective product.)  It only takes a little and once you become familiar with it, you will know exactly how much works without an uncomfortable greasy feeling.  LOVE THIS!  ❤️. Did I mention it works and very reasonably priced?  Customer for life.  Thanks NOW Solutions. A little goes a long way! It is greasy so I think that I will be primarily use at night with gloves on. My hands are so dry that there are painful splits at my fingertips. I have tried everything....even bagbalm!!! Nothing helps.I will update with results.UPDATE: I did purchase lightweight night gloves to wear over Lanolin at night. BTW- I don't even notice that I am wearing them. What an enormous difference this has made for my hands!!! I no longer have deep, painful cracks around my nails. My skin is so soft all of the time. It even made them look younger, which was not my goal, but a pleasant bonus. Getting rid of all of that dry skin on my hands and wrists made the skin smooth and taut. I highly recommend!!! Keeps my dry cuticles moisturized. It's pure lanolin, so it is sticky and doesn't spread well.  It has little odor and no fragrance added. To me, it is a large jar and a good value. Best cream I have ever used for dry cracked hands. If you want something that smells nice, this is not for you. No scent is added and it smells ever so slightly of sheep. Not enough to notice unless you hold you hands up to your nose. The relief to my dry hands is worth the tiny bit of aroma. I use this product to help with dry scalp for myself and my children and it is amazing. I also use it to retwist my children’s Locs. It leaves no residue and results in moisturized, shiny curls. I’ve struggled to resolve the serious splitting of my finger tips and parched knuckles during the winter, but alas I found a product that prevents my finger from splitting and cracking to begin with. The lanolin is thick and I use it on hand and feet. AND its’s 100% NATURAL!"
270,B000K1MUH0,"I purchased this product along with the sweet sweat waist trimmer.  I love using sweet sweat however the waist trimmer is not a fave of mine.  This stuff truly works.  Now you can't just slap some on and lose inches you have to really work out and get the sweet sweat flowing.  Using this product I was losing inches off of my waist every week.  I love using this with the McDavid waist trimmer once you work out and take that off you can see all the sweat.  The more you sweat the more you lose.  I stopped using it for a while with the holidays passing I was not really eating right and not excersing as I should have been and have gained what I lost but it is a new year and I will continue to use my sweet sweat and will definetely order as soon as it gets low, because I loved the results I was seeing.  Just basics on me I am not athletic built, I am a female 29 years old with extra baggage I am trying to lose, I was 219.8 when I started using this product.  I worked out on elliptical 40 min a day 6 days a weeks and also other workouts for 5-10 min using apps from my phone.  I tracked everything I ate and had a cheat day a week.  I was down to 204 and this was within a 3 week time span, I know I was losing inches because every week my fiance would measure me and the weight was falling off!!  I looked better could see the difference in my midsection and that is my most troublesome area. YEAH IT'S MESSY BUT UM, SO IS SWEATING!! DUH!THAT SEEMS TO BE THE GENERAL COMPLAINT BUT I TOTALLY GET IT. IT'S MESSY, ACTUALLY IT COULD KIND OF GET EVERYWHERE BUT IT WORKS. IT HASN'T REALLY MADE ME SWEAT A TON BUT IT HAS ME SWEATING MORE THAN A REGULAR INSANITY WORKOUT.THE SMELL IS PLEASANT SO THATS A PLUS, BECAUSE GUYS, I MEAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, IF WE STILL SMELL LIKE IRISH SPRING AFTER A WORKOUT, IT WASN'T REALLY A WORKOUT.I USE IT WITH AN EVERLAST STOMACH WRAP (ANY NEOPRENE WRAP WILL DO) AND THAT HELPS.I'VE ALREADY WASHED A LOAD OF WORKOUT CLOTHES I USED WHILE ON SWEET SWEAT AND I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE CLOTHES STAINING.SHIPPING WAS LIGHTNING FAST!I MIGHT TRY THE SWEET SWEAT STICK TO SEE IF THE MESS FACTOR IS MINIMIZED BUT OVERALL I'M A HAPPY SWEATY CAMPER.**** TIP****THIS PRODUCT DOES LEAVE A WATER RESISTANT COATING ON THE HANDS AND IS HARD TO RUB OFF EASILY WITH JUST REGULAR SOAP AND WATER SO I USE DEGREASING DISH SOAP. YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE IT IN YOUR HOMES SO I'M SURE IT WON'T BE MUCH OF A PROBLEM GETTING A HOLD OF A BOTTLE. UNLESS OF COURSE YOUR HANDS ARE COVERED IN SWEET SWEAT, THEN IT'S LIKE CATCHING A GREASED PIG. This thing truly helped make me sweat like crazy along with their sweet sweat belt! I could t believe it at first but you truly sweat A LOT--and I RARELY ever sweat despite how hard I work out! Plus, I absolutely LOVE the scent they have in this cuz it smells so good that honestly i feel that it masks the nasty sweaty smell you'd typically get after a hard workout. However, I have this a 4 star instead of 5 because I must say that the directions instructed that you put on the product VERY liberally and not to rub it in. The product looks and feels exactly like Vaseline. So honestly, I actually question whether the excessive ""sweat"" I got was actually my own perspiration or is it because the generous amount of product that ""melted"" or condensated into little dews because of the temperature of your body...kind of like coconut oil where it comes on like Vaseline but melts into watery substance upon contact with heat? So I'm not sure....a bit skeptical only because you seriously get sweaty ONLY in the areas you put the product on....see the picture. I'm a normally overweight 44 year old woman who had a baby 18 months ago.  I haven't been able to lose the baby fat.First workout: 182lbs, waist 39"", abdomen 41"".  I walked for 40 minutes and climbed a hill for about 20 minutes. Post measurements: 179lbs, waist 37"", abdomen 39"".  I should have measured more areas but definitely it's working.  The smell is fragrant and really not that bad in my opinion.  I wore cheap neoprene compression slimming shorts and a McDavid waist belt higher up around upper abs and back.  It was cool outside so most sweat dripping was from abdomen.  The by product dripping sweat is greasy so it's not something I would feel comfortable using inside a health club-- dripping greasy sweat all over the machines is not my thing.  I dripped greasy sweat in the bathroom and almost slipped on it.  So be careful.Also I believe it did help me have a faster warm up and prevented my knees from hurting during all this climbing.  I started sweating after about 30 minutes of walking and then quite a bit with the hill climb of course.I put it all over since all my areas are problem fatty areas.  It also has made my skin extremely soft.I'm loving it and thought the price was fair. This stuff is really awesome. I didn't really get it for increased fat loss but I do believe it helps in this department. I'm already really lean but it seems to be helping a tad. The thing I love about this is that I put it on the muscles that I'm about to train, and I warm up MUCH quicker. I feel it working and when I'm done with my workout, I'm drenched in sweat. Also, I become extremely vascular on the area that I apply it on, which tells you a significant amount about the efficacy with this product. I do believe it helps increase thermogenesis in the area that you have it on, which will ultimately lead to fat loss. BUT the main reason I use it, is to warm up quicker and prevent injuries. Don't expect miracles. This will only assist with an already focused and consistent diet/training program.Side note, it's extremely hard to get off. Use a towel to wipe it off, then shower. I also have tried the coconut smell and that really smells horrible. It smells like, well, sweat. The original formula smells more like coconut in my opinion, and has a better overall smell. I have been using the waist band with this product and without the ""sweet sweat"" product. I am unable to determine if this product works. I sweat as much without the product as I do with the product. It has made no difference in my waist size. For this reason, I will not be repurchasing."
271,B001CJJ5NQ,"I've been using this mask once a week for 3 weeks now and I think this is the best product I have ever used on my face! After the first use, I got one of the biggest pimples on my face but this mask made it so that it was much less noticeable than other products I've tried. I have very fair and sensitive skin. Any other products I have tried has either dried out my face and made it all peely or I broke out all over my face. This one felt great immediately after use and gave me a very evenly toned complexion, so the giant pimple that appeared was just barely a little pink, which is amazing because usually they are very red. The awesome lasted for about 2-3 days which impressed me :) No burning sensation or anything. I used Cetaphil lotion to moisturize afterwards, which is the only one that doesn't make me break out or make me feel too oily. Another great thing about this mask is that only a little goes a loooonngg way. My new favorite part of my facial regime. I'm so excited that I found this product. I usually get more pimples when I'm menstruating, but so far so good. no pimples in sight. I couldn't be more pleased. I'm a very fair skinned redhead with combination skin and mild to moderate acne. I love this product! I like the product. I'm not sure if I saw a drastic reduction in my blackheads and pores, but it does what most good masks do...which is it helps pull out some impurities in the skin and holds the product (in this case, hydroxy acid) to the skin for a while to do its business. I didn't use it quickly enough and it has dried out. I just pull some out with the back of my nail, put it in my palm, and add a few drips of water to get it back to mask consistency. It's pretty pricey, but the jar lasts for a while. Love this line of products. The mask is thick but light. I use a warm wash cloth to wipe it off. It doesn’t peel off. Skin looks radiant. I use it once a week. So I'm usually the type that doesn't do masks regularly, and then once in a while I did the Bior strips.  Now that I'm a bit older and I'm trying to pay more attention to my skin, I thought I'd invest in a decent mask product and give it a shot.I am very very impressed with this product.  It cleans my pores out just as well as a Bior strip without the ouch factor and the potential skin damage.  Also, it just makes my skin feel clean and revitalized without drying it out.I""m not the type to comment on cosmetic products very much - but this is a clear winner and I'd recommend that people with normal to slightly oily skin give this a try. Best pore shrinking/cleaning & detoxifying masque on the market ! It's expensive, but it lasts a while. I do it once or twice a week. HIGHEST recommendation from a woman who's tried E V E R Y T H I N G else. Great product. This clarifying mask was used during a anti aging facial at a spa and it was recommended that I use it twice a week.  I have some pores and oily skin and this tones an clarifies my skin making it smoother, softer and even toned.  Instead of buying it at the spa I did some research and ordered it for cheaper at amazon. The quality of this product is fantastic, I think it may be a little too intense for my skin type. I originally used this 2x/week and my skin feels clean after use just a bit too tight and dry. I always put on moisturizer when I am done but I am still not sure I am doing the right thing for my body. If you are looking for a deeper clean this is a good product. I will probably continue to use this just not as frequently. I use this product about once a week... I'm not exactly sure if it does anything. It doesn't make my skin look any better or worse, it just sort of is whatever.  I've put it on a few incoming pimples, but have also layered on BP and it seems to do the trick. I think it's mostly the BP working, though.  If you can get this for cheap, I'd recommend it because it may work for you.  If you think it's expensive, skip it."
272,B000V10N7I,"I received the bottle yesterday and my first thought was ""wow, 1.01 oz is a very very tiny quantity! I used it for the first time about 10 minutes ago, and I am writing the review because the laptop just happened to be on and nearby.Immediate reaction: not bad. I have bad skin because I am generally bad at caring for it, and I like to blame it on the 2-yr old. I used a very small pea sized portion (just where some of the product was sticking to the cap). When I rubbed it in it felt very gel-like and I was about to feel some regret for not heeding the 1-star reviews, when the consistency started getting more watery. Then the globules began to form. I kept the circular motion for about 30 seconds from start to finish then used tissue to wipe it off then warm water and a soft washcloth to clean it off. I used it just around the area of my nose where my pores are the most visible. I have to say after the treatment the skin in that area feels very smooth compared to the cheeks and forehead. The pores and blackheads are still there, and I wasn't expecting miracles either, but when I used a Biore blackhead removal strip the pores cleaned up much better than usual (the proof being on the strip). My goal will be do use it twice a week and see where the 1.01 oz will take my skin. I will update in a couple of weeks.UPDATE (10/15/2012):As I said before I am bad at caring for my skin and I have not used this product as regularly as I should, BUT everytime I do use it, I like the effects. The first few times I got a few bumps in my acne-prone areas. Now I am more careful to scrub more gently and I wash well with cool water. I read some of the reviews where it is said the product doesn't really peel, just balls up on itself. I think if you look in your sink you will notice that the ""rubbings"" are brown (mine were!) especially if I use after a gap of a few days, which to me suggested that a lot of dirt was being removed. But don't just go by what is in those cast offs. I would be surprised if your skin did not immediately feel very....well....clean, kind of stretched, just better complexion overall. I know this because my normally unobservant husband noticed :) I am definitely keeping this (and committing to more regular use, lets see how that goes). I love, love, love this product! I dont have much of an acne problem but I get dead skin on my face after a week, VERY annoying when applying make-up. I struggled for a long time to find a product that would take this issue away; facial mask, peel, etc. nothing really worked. I came across Swissa Beauty and decided to give it a try, and I am SO happy with the outcome; it gets the dirt out of your pores AND sweeps away dead skin (turns into little balls).I recently saw reviews stating it didnt work and people thought it was just a 'prop' when the mixture turned into balls, not removing dead skin. I can tell you this is not the case. I wonder if people are using the product correctly. Lucky for me, I got a demo when first buying this at the mall.***How to Use***:1) Apply even *thin* layer of product to skin (if you use too much its going to take longer), let sit for 1 to 1 1/2 mins or fan face with hands to speed up process. ***This is a face peel, its not going to have time to take effect if you leave it on for 5 seconds.2)Rub all areas that you applied the gel. If you left it on for a decent amount of time it should get a grainy feeling when you rub.  --If you want to see the dirt being removed use a cotton ball/pad AFTER rubbing and wipe an area -you'll be amazed how much there is!3) Grab warm wash cloth or keep using cotton (I prefer a wash cloth) and wipe clean. If you left the product on too long (which happens) just scrub that area or reapply a little gel on affected area and clean again. When finished splash water on your face and make sure all areas are gel free.4) Pat face dry.***Hints***:1) 'Little balls' turn gray when they are lifting skin, if you dont have much of a dead skin problem, its not going to pick up much and 'balls' will be white. Also, the 'little ball' and dirt removal are two different processes in one product.2) If you see some dead skin it missed, reapply a little gel to the affected area and repeat process. Possibly leave it on a little longer; the sea weed might not have penetrated through.3) I only use this once a week and my Olay pore cleanser the rest of the week. Too much of this product is overkill.Hope this helps! And thanks Swisa for a wonderful product, I will continue to order and re-order!!! I first purchased this brand years ago and have kept it in my refrigerator, using it most sparingly, simply because I loved it and didn’t want to run out. Recently my daughter &my two teenage grandchildren can to stay with us for a bit. Looking for fun things to do together one evening we all did facials and wanting to be the coolest grandma I introduced them to Swisa beauty Dead Sea facial peel. It was a huge success (and so was I) so naturally I was hoping to find more though I was very doubtful it was even still being manufactured. To my hearts surprise as well as my hearts gratitude it was!!! Thanks Amazon! I adore this stuff. And I've used... a lot of stuff.You don't need to use much of it together the results that you want, so a little goes a long way. Using it semi-weekly, I expect this jar to probably last me at least the better part of a year.Afterwards, my skin feels soft and has a glow. My pores are shrinking, im breaking out less, and my blackheads are clearing out.The exfoliation is awesome. It's not ""the product balling up on itself like glue"", because if those people bothered to use it twice in a row, they'd notice that it wouldn't happen.I've had skin problems since a huge pimple popped up on my nose in 5th grade, 20 years ago. I've tried so many products and home remedies I've lost count.My skin broke out *just a little bit* more than usual after my first application, but I'm now convinced my pores were just being purged because my skin looks better than has in an indefinite amount of time, and continues to improve. It's still not flawless, but one of my mottos is ""Progress; not perfection.""I am continuing to see progress, so I'm continuing to use the product. I'm a happy lady."
273,B000FVCNEK,"This makes my skin feel super soft. It does have fragrance. I personally love the smell but I know not all can do fragrance. I’ll be buying this through the remainder of my pregnancy. Anything Pamlers is everything to me. Love these products for years Me gusta el pero no lo puedo mezclar con la crema de la misma marca porque se corta, salen unos grumos horrible en la piel cuando lo estás aplicando It’s good for itch! Es un producto de muy buena calidad.  Pero el empaque llegó averiado y ha sido complicado su uso I can't speak of the soothing itching but it definitely hydrates and leaves your skin soft. I’m allergic to fragrance so this made my belly break out were my stretch marks were and ultimately making more scars😩 This has been my holy grail savior for the insanely itchy skin that has accompanied my pregnancy. My bf and I apply this nightly all over my body, air dry for a few minutes and then get in bed. Moisturizes wonderfully, applies easily, and smells great!"
274,B00171ETM6,"I searched a long time for an unscented lotion I could use on my face and body and this is it!! Been using for over a year and it works great on my dry sensitive skin. Not too thin, not oily, no scent. Thanks Curel! -Jennifer RN MSN I love it. I can wear this face to toes. Very gentle. I didn’t have any reaction at all. Great for under the makeup too! What a great product...It Really works well. Does everything it promises to do. The sent is not over powering it's very light and won't interfere with your perfume. This is a great PRODUCT not too greasy just perfect Cruel is my go-to daily body lotion.  I prefer the no-fragrance type.  This lotion works well, goes on smoothly and does not leave a film. Thick lotion that absorbs quickly.  Light, clean scent although it has no added fragrance.  Time-released so lasts longer than other lotions.  Hypo-allergenic.  Skin feels moisturized.  Will buy again. A very pleasant cream.  It smooths in easily and makes skin feel soft.  No fragrance was a requirement which is primarily why I chose this product.  I will re-order when out.  Reasonably priced. My son suffers from eczema but hates the feel of lotion and is sensitive to smells. This does the trick! It's super moisturizing but absorbs very quickly and feels great. I will definitely keep ordering this one."
275,B00115TXRE,"I didn't pay attention to size for $$$ amount I feel like this serum literally tightens the skin around my eyes instantly. A friend bought some while we were at the Dead Sea & let me use it. I was on a mission to find some of this serum as soon as I get home! It is a little bit pricey but well worth it! Update : Customer service contacted me and gave me an option to get a refund or expedited new one.  I got my refund.  I gave more stars as their customer service was good but still only 4 stars as I didn't get to try out their product.Original  : My in laws swear this stuff is amazing so I ordered for the first time.  I thought I was supposed to get a new version (white bottle) but the old version of green came.  What's the point of advertising that they got a brand new face lift but then sells the older stuff.  It feels deceiving.  However, I didn't even get to use it as the bottle was ejected from the original package and broke among the other stuff in the box.  My other items in the package got to wear the serum. Condition of product when delivered was poor. This is exactly what the description states. Great Product 👍 Doesn't irritate my eyes . Leaves area nice and smooth. I have been using the premier eye serum for 9 months and I like the consistency.  I do think it has prevented eye wrinkles.  I paid a lot more money for it at the kiosk in the mall where the women are very persuasive and act like ""you are killing them"" when you don't pay the asking price.  I think they wanted $140.00 for the eye serum.  I paid $88. I think.  I am in Florida for the winter and needed more.  I figured I would check on-line and found the same product for under $35.00.  It was actually sent from Israel in the identical bottle so I know it is the real thing.  It took a while to get here, but there was no tax and no shipping fee.  It doesn't get any better than that.  My only negative comment would be that I only need a little bead of the serum, and it is difficult to press the blue top down enough to get something, but not too much that you get more product than you need.  I will order the eye serum again through Amazon. The last three bottles of Premier Dead Sea products I've received have had defective bottles. I've not been able to set them up for push-button dispensing, and have had to transfer the lotion (undoubtedly losing some in the process) to a small plastic bottle. I can't believe I'm the only one having this issue, but I urge you to get it fixed. I like the product, but I'm really getting frustrated with the shoddy dispenser. To repeat my review: Unless you can verify that you'll be fixing the bottles, I will no longer be buying the product. My three star is to average out the product, which I would give a 5 star to, and the bottle, which I would give a zero star for."
276,B0000ZHH5G,"This is the only lotion I will use. It’s not full of toxic foreign chemicals and it’s the only lotion that combats my dry cracking painful eczema hands in the winter. I’ve even done the Vaseline with cotton gloves on at night & that doesn’t work, only this lotion works.I use this lotion on my face as well. It’ll get rid of a dry spot in 1-2 days.This product from this seller comes sealed. When you remove the screw off plastic blue lid there is a safety seal in tact, so I believe this seller is selling authentic products. I actually contacted Vanicream to confirm the design of the safety seal was authentic but they never got back to me. :( A random lady at dinner one night turned me to this... My daughter, now 1, has had bad eczema since birth. Nothing was helping. She noticed it on her little fit and told me to buy this lotion. It's made a huge difference! We use it every night after her bath and sometimes during the day if needed. Truly - ditch everything you have and try this. It's helped so much for my girl. This product has replaced Cetaphil cream for me. It's lighter and less greasy than Cetaphil which I like. I use it for moisturizing my face and body, and also as a styling product for my hair since all hair products contain PEGs (and/or alcohol) which I have developed an allergy to. I put it on my (short) hair when it's towel dry and combed. I don't remember how many tubs I've used up. I've always wanted to try some fancy face and body lotions but in the end I just had to come back to this. I live in a humid weather and I have combination oily skin yet I still use it even in the summertime (just less amount). Recently my aunt had some unknown skin issue (most likely due to coldness and dryness) I let her try Vanicream and few days later, no more issue for her. This moisturizer is the best I have purchased yet. It has helped heal skin issues, provides a barrier of protection and even stops itching. Since using it for over a month, age spots are lightening and my complexion is even better! I had purchased a small tube but now have the 16oz size since my wife has taken an interest in using it as well. Works for me! My baby dermo recommend this product and its very good keep baby skin soft and moist. This stuff is the best for babies with eczema! If you're new to eczema, bless you.  You have a long road ahead.  For most people, it does not go away.  But this product is the best our family has found in this, our tenth year, of dealing with this very difficult skin disorder.  My first reason for writing this review is to assure you that any bad reviews of this product are from (probably) nice, but uneducated-in-eczema individuals.  There is no miracle product out there -- that we've found -- that makes eczema disappear.  Some people have found products that keeps their eczema under control, but that is not what Vanicream is for.Vanicream is called a moisturizing skin cream.  But with eczema, the key is to put moisture in the skin and trap it there.  That's where vanicream comes in.  I absolutely love this product.  But don't expect it to cure eczema.The day someone finds a cure for eczema, and one that works for everyone, it will be all over the news.  I assure you.  For now, too many pharmaceutical companies are making money off of it's ""treatment,"" so I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.There is a lot of information I want to share with you, but I want to mention this before I forget: sometimes amazon has a good price or some deal for vanicream, but I've found that dermadoctor usually has the best price.  If you buy over a certain dollar amount (which I always do) they give you free shipping.  That's sometimes 1/3 of the price of the product.  And, if you're buying vanicream for dry skin, you'll want to keep this in stock anyway.  So go ahead and buy several at a time.Use Vanicream 1 - 3 minutes after exiting a VERY brief bath/shower.  You do not have to use soap except in ""certain"" areas.  And for that, use Vanicream's soap.  You DO want to get water in the skin, but don't stay in the water so long that it washes out any moisture that may be there.  One of the best pieces of advice I read in all of the eczema research I did is this: Water cleans.  And it does.  So don't think you have to use soap or scrubbing.  A quick bath/shower with a soft cloth is all that's usually needed for eczema skin.  TOWEL OFF LIGHTLY, just the water that's sitting on top of the skin.  IMMEDIATELY put on the Vanicream.  From water to toweling to Vanicream should be less than three minutes.  This is crucial.The ""water cleans"" advice comes from a very helpul book called HEALING ECZEMA by Christina Nevada.  If you are really suffering from eczema, you must read this book.A very helpful website (including educating your child's school on how difficult it is to live with eczema) [...]We have taken my son to at least 10 dermatologists who mostly seemed to have a very lackadaisical attitude toward eczema.  Never having had it themselves, they must imagine it to be just an annoying little condition.In reality, those who live with it know that it can consume your life.  You get no sleep, your aware of your skin all the time, you may be very self-conscious of your inflammations/wounds, while everyone else is sitting calmly, concentrating at work or in class, all you can think about is your skin, and so on.We finally did find a doctor that has compassion. For me, compassion is only second to ""really knowing your stuff"" in the medical profession.  Dr. Crotty didn't prescribe a lot of meds, but even the ones he prescribed we've mostly stopped using. Only ""Dermasmooth"" really helps the skin during exceptional flare-ups, otherwise it's managing your diet and your environment.  We have also found it helpful to take an antihistamine to control the itching.  But no prescription is needed for that. We just use Benadryl.Make your world mostly scentless (no perfumes, candles, etc).  Keep your house as clean as possible.  Change a/c filters often.  Eat more healthy oils, like putting olive oil on salads.  Eat VERY healthy.  This means limiting junk food and take out and adding in lots and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Don't eat fresh strawberries unless their organic (due to pesticides) and limit acidic foods such as oranges as they actually change your body's chem. balance.  Soda/pop/cola/soft-drink is HORRIBLE for people with eczema.  A book called ""The Acid Alkaline Food Guide"" by Dr. Susan E. Brown explains why.But the number one thing I have found to be helpful in dealing with this condition is God.  Whether you believe in Him or not is not the issue.  I'm just telling you what has worked for our family.Lastly, to parents of eczema sufferers:Just know that eczema is affecting your child on an emotional level and have compassion over their lack of sleep and inability to concentrate (both of which gets them in trouble at school sometimes), as well as the irritability that they feel but can't explain, which gets them in trouble with you.  Be patient with them.And be patient with yourself.  Realize that this is affecting you too.  But know that you and your child are in this together.  Research, read, learn, and grow through this experience together.P.S. Stay out of the sun whenever possible. And when you are in the sun, wear sensitive-skin sunscreen.  Vanicream makes one of those too."
277,B000PHUKEE,"I have used ""Shield"" for several years.  It is the lightest chemical based sunscreen I could find for my sensitive, dry skin.  I use it after applying my moisturizer.  It is non-irritating and absorbs quickly.  It does not leave a white cast. Often I will use a ""tinted"" sunscreen over it in place of makeup (EltaMD Physical tinted, or EltaMD Clear tinted).  The 2 together, give me great  sun protection without being too heavy.  Shield does have Octinoxate, but it is not irritating nor does it smell.  The product is fragrance free which is very hard to find in a sunscreen.  It can be used on either face or body.  I have found that 100% mineral based sunscreens are too heavy, greasy and leave a white film on my face.  ""Shield"" is a good compromise. I’ve used this oil-free product for over 10 years. The product I received says it is oil-free, but it is not oil-free, nor is it fragrance free. Evidently packaged wrong. Very dissatisfied. I didn't realize I had sensitive skin but I tried every single sunscreen suggested by the Sephora associates and I got a rash from every single one.  According to them they were 'green' products so I shouldn't have had a reaction.  A coworker mentioned her dermatologist suggested EltaMD and she loved it.  I tried it and sure enough, I had no reaction to this product.  It goes on smoothly and lasts through 100 degree weather.  I don't know about the moisturizing part because I use a moisturizer under it.  Never tries it as a moisturizer.I do highly recommend this product whether or not you have sensitive skin. For deeper skin tones make sure you rub the sunscreen into your hands to warm it up and massage it into your skin. There are days when I can see a slight white cast but it’s minimal and those are the days I rush putting it on. For lighter skin tones this is great for you, for deeper skin tones it’s hit or miss but the ingredients are too good to not give it a try. It also lasts, I’ve had it for 5 months and I use it everyday. So it’s worth the coin if you do end up liking this! I am a fair skinned, 59 year old woman who has recently semi retired to the beach to a house with a pool. I try to take care of my skin despite over exposure to the Southern sun. This year, “regular”, National brand cream and spray sunscreens were causing my chest and neck area to break out in a rash. This product has been a lifesaver. I use it on my face (and also wear a hat) and chest and haven’t had the Dermatitis. I will order again and keep this in my beach bag! Moisturizing not greasy.  Very light coverage could be used alone, but I use under makeup.  I have had skin cancer so I want protection. I have been looking forever for an untinted sunscreen that doesn't leave an oily/shiny residue on my face after.  This sunscreen works great!  The consistency is just right, more of a lotion than a cream that can be easily applied and spread.  When first applied I thought it left a white film on my face, but after you rub it in well it doesn't leave a film.  (I have tan/olive skin) A little goes a long way, so use it liberally.  I found if I used too much on my face, that's when I started to see a white film.  This sunscreen barely leaves a shine on my face, much better than any other sunscreen I've tried, which is a lot.  The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer sunscreen leaves too much of a shine on my face, and I found this brand to leave my skin looking like normal.  It doesn't make it quite matte, but gives it a natural look without all the shine.I had previously been using Cotz tinted matte sunscreen because I wanted a tint sunscreen that wouldn't make my face shiny, but I decided to try an untinted sunscreen because the tinted sunscreen would get on my clothes or towels if I wiped my face. I really like this. For comparison, I had been using the EltaMD Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 40 for the last year and I actually like this one better. I had originally chose the ""moisturizing sunscreen"" because of the hyaluronic acid content (I have dry skin from tretinoin use), but I really didn't find it hydrating enough - my skin would be dry and flaky by lunch and makeup didn't look great over it because it would settle in the dry spots. This one is way better. It isn't marketed for dry skin, in fact, it says ""normal to oily"" but I find it wears much better on my dry skin. It's not greasy at all, and it's not exactly hydrating (I do think oilier skinned folks would be happy with this), yet somehow I don't feel like my my skin is completely dehydrated at the end of the day anymore. I'm not sure if this is related but I've also found that my skin is clearer when using this? I never noticed until I switched to this that the other sunscreen was making me break out. +10 points for the higher SPF (45 vs 40 in the moisturizing sunscreen), and the larger bottle. Far more economical per ounce for a better product."
278,B000PHVTVC,"All I can say is my husband loves this cleanser, it leaves his skin soft and he has dark spots on his cheeks and the ingredients in this is great for that! Just bought my second bottle. I have dry, sensitive, and starting to age, skin. You don’t need much, I use it in the shower, and it’s lasted around a year. I can feel it exfoliating my skin which is necessary even more as you age, especially with dry skin. I saw that someone left a review saying this product is fake, which worries me a bit, but it works so I can’t really complain. I definitely recommend it, I will keep using and buying more as long as I continue to see results. Love this cleanser. it fells like diminishes some small wrinkles. I love it. I have no complaints about this facewash. It has a nice, light smell and is not harsh on my skin. Will buy again. Cleans without feeling dry. I love it! Very good face wash removes all oils and debris a little drying. Really enjoyed this product.  Easy on the skin and not a harsh smell either. Very lightweight too. Like many busy adults, I’m looking for the most efficient way to get clear skin, not something that ties me up for over an hour each week and preventative. I also wanted something that is dermatologist recommended and doesn’t contribute to aging. This product hit all those notes. You only use 1-3 times per week, it’s pretty fast to apply and remove—can you really get more efficient? After a month of using it 2x a week I only have one acne nodule, and less acne overall (whereas I usually have a few more) and the pre-existing acne and spots have been SLOWLY clearing up. My skin looks more even in general. And in terms of aging, this is mildly exfoliating without any abrasion, which is great! I’d feel more comfortable with no exfoliation but without it I’d probably just be getting more acne scars.Although I am somewhat light skinned I do have pronounced hyper pigmentation and this has been helpful, although I can’t tell if it’s only because I have less acne surfacing or if it is also because it phases out the hyperpigmentation spots. I was hoping it would lighten the dark corners of my lips, but so far I don’t see a difference there.I don’t think this product is a silver bullet, but it is a great bang for your effort and great bang for your buck. I would recommend going by the directions, which say 1-3 times a week and depending on the skin type. Definitely moisturize afterwards and maybe protect your lips as you apply (I bite my lips constantly, I don’t need any more exfoliation there). I would use it at night, because it makes your skin sensitive to the elements, so ensuring some time between the wash and sun exposure is helpful, I think. I don’t know if this could replace an every day wash, but I’ve skipped my regular wash on the days where I use this product."
279,B00027DHYM,"I'm a habitual user of this product and I love it,  but I just hate how messy it gets when they ship it.  It always spills inside the little baggy, and this time it didn't even have that clear cap previous ones had. I just wish they could come up with a way to prevent this from happening. First and foremost, here is my full regimen for my body acne:-Spironolactone (Dr. Prescribed and NOT for males (who are not transitioning MtoF anyway - it plummets testosterone) Also treats my hormonal facial acne)-Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash (non-exfoliating, used with Eco-Tools natural bristle brush on a handle to reach my back - I've tried many brushes and Eco-Tools works the best)-This Body Spray (Recently added, seems to be what was missing from my routine)I've suffered break outs on my face, back chest and recently booty since I was about 13 (now 36). It would go away but never fully. Within the last year, I was prescribed Spironolactone 100MG for my adult acne that was caused by PCOS. It reduced the acne all over my face and body, but again, not fully. It would flare up on my body when I worked out. Sweat related. I've tried the body sprays that cost $30.00+ in the past, and remembered they helped. So I decided to shop around again, and found this. I've been using it for just over a month and my back/chest/booty are CLEAR! The only thing there are some old discoloration scars and marks but I'm clear! I was starting to think I just had to accept the embarrassing break outs and that I would never be able to wear backless dresses and such.I'm really impressed and I hope it keeps working! I spray it twice a day. Once in the morning after my post-run/work out shower. I wash with the Neutrogena Body Wash and Eco-Tools Brush. Dry off completely. Spray this on my chest/shoulders/back/booty. Let it dry, then get dressed. And I use it again before bed. Letting it dry fully before getting dressed.I REALLY wish I had taken before and after photos. I'm really amazed! I'm sure that it doesn't work for everyone (looking at other reviews) and feel bad that it doesn't. But, I'm thankful I took a chance and tried this first before I bought something that cost around 3x as much! I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has body acne. It is easy to use, it doesn't stain your clothes and it actually works. It has completely cleared up the acne I get on my shoulders, back and chest. I have tried everything out there and this product actually works the best. It is definitely worth trying, and you can't beat the price. When I see any indication of acne on my back or chest, I spray this thoroughly maybe twice a day all over myself and in 2-3 days everything clears up. Let it dry on your skin before putting clothes on - I prefer to do it as I’m getting ready so I can walk around and let it air dry before I either go to bed or put on my outfit. I've been using this for a month or so now, and it's good and bad and not nearly the miracle product that they make it sound like. I am a large, fat woman. Even before I was fat I would get small zits that would turn into nasty and painful boils under my breasts and between my thighs. I've never been able to do anything about it. I have tried everything. So I decided to try this when I saw it had a bottle that I could use from any angle.Here's the deal (at least for me). My underboob acne is significantly reduced. It flares up monthly, but that's not shocking since I get acne on my face at the same time. The zits have not gone away. However, when I get them, they are far shorter in duration, and I haven't had any turn into cysts or boils under my breasts. This is a happy thing, and for me to go a couple of months without dealing with it? HEAVEN.My thighs are different. Using it seems to stop some from forming. However, if they start to form? Oh well, SOL. I have managed to keep two small and manageable, but they do get large and hard and tender, but instead of *GROSSNESS HERE, LOOK AWAY OR STOP READING) getting worse and worse until they break open and repeatedly drain all over whatever I'm wearing that day, they lose the tenderness and stay hard for a while. I did manage to disappear a few before they got bad, though. The problem is that there's some delicate stuff down in that area. So getting the leg joint without hitting the delicate bits can cause some interesting finegaling. Same with the ass cheek (which totally went away, woot!).Way more than anyone wants to know about my body acne, but hey, I would have liked to get something this detailed. Then again, I knew it wasn't going to be the wonder product that the description makes it out to be. That being said, I'm back to order two more bottles. The first one isn't empty, but I want one in my bedroom and one in the bathroom."
280,B001FYXA6G,"Very good sun protection.  A little goes a long way.  I live in the desert southwest and I put just a small amount on my face and it lasts for a whole round of golf.  I'd highly recommend product works great for them money spent Nice I love this sunscreen, it is great quality, applies easily and without leaving any white.  Great for acne problem skin.  I have been using this sunscreen for years but the latest bottle I purchased had a little pre made hole at the bottom where a lot of product leaked out in gobs while the bottle sat unused in my cabinet for a few months.  I contacted the company directly and they did not resolve the issue and told me to deal with Amazon, but since it is way past the purchase date I do not have that option.  Just bought another bottle of this but upon inspecting it it has that same small hole at the bottom where it leaked once before.  For 50 bucks I am returning the producr asap and finding something else froma company that stands by their product when there clearly are issues with the packaging.  See for yourself there are other reviewers with the same leaky hole in their bottle.  Sure, I could put the product in another container but with a 50 dollar price tag I should not have to do that. The EltaMD line was recommended by my dermatologist.  I’ve tried the Sheer, Every Day, Sport, and Active.  They don’t clog my skin and I don’t break out.  The main difference seems to me to be their thickness.  When I play 3 hours of Pickleball in the Summer, I use the Active.  It goes on thick and white, but it lasts.  It is so water/sweatproof that you have to wash your hands to get it off.  I need to apply only once after 1 1/2 hours.  The Sport is great when I’m sweating less.  It blends in quicker. LOVE this stuff.  Recommended by my dermatologist and cheaper on here than what she sells it for.  :)  Well worth the money. If I pay 1/8  of the price for over the counter brand sunscreen and it doesn't get used by the rest of the family, then am I really saving any money?  I use the EltaMD for face or Obagi sunscreen for myself on a daily basis (arms and neck and chest for driving in traffic) because I have melasma on my face and neck, but this summer I purchased this for use on an island primitive camping trip. No shade on the island unless we were inside of our HOT tent, so we were exposed for 3 days straight and in and out of the ocean trying to stay cool.  Not only did this keep us from burning BUT it goes on and dries so quickly that my 16 year old son who normally will avoid wearing sunscreen due to its sticky feeling, actually walked over several times a day and put this on his arms, neck, face, legs,feet and back himself.  That speaks volumes for how great this is.My 16 year old  comes into my bathroom to use it daily now for marching band practice. It has a convenient pump that gives just enough to slather on the right amount for a limb or torso so you know you aren't using too little.Rubs in quickly and smoothly with little to no feeling afterwords.Super Lightweight on the skin. It is water/sweat resistant as it claims and doesn't have you smelling like sunscreen or sand, gnats and other gunk sticking to your body because you are sticky.Highly recommend this product, especially if you have an aversion to wearing daily sunscreen like I do. I use this every morning and nightIt’s the bestLeaves my face looking very hydrated and glossy ! It works. It’s my new go to for sunscreen when I’m riding my bike."
281,B000ABOLZ4,"Shrinkflation has come to Kirk's. The bars are noticeably smaller. You lost a star for this one, guys.Otherwise, same great soap. This soap is a brand my whole family can use. We love it! We like this soap very much, prefer to bathe and wash hands with this soap I am outdoors a lot and I get dirty there; landscaping, mowing, equipment maintenance, playing, etc. a good shower is always in store at the end of the day.  Before I never paid too much attention to what soap I had, it amounted to what my family had in the bathroom at the time and some I liked better than others but when my dad brought over a few bars of this (I didn't pay much attention then) and it made it's way into the shower I noticed a difference.  It is a clean soap, that might not make sense but it's the best adjective I can come up with and when you learn it is natural, no dye's, etc. it only adds to fact that it seems to clean you up a little better than the others.  Since those few bars were given to us and used I have personally seen to it that we use this soap and this is the second time I've ordered the 24 pack (a double order for 48) so coming from me, not a soap and beauty products type, I guess that says a lot. If you haven't tried this soap, you really should. I won't buy anything else. Other all natural brands are way more expensive. It is pretty strong and lathers like crazy, especially from a new bar. it has a lot of glycerine in it so it does dissolve fairly easily. The scent is very mild and kind of an old fashioned clean masculine smell. The one weird thing with this soap is that sometimes it seems to burn on thin and/or sensitive skin, like eyelids. I don't know why, but a lot of internet crackpots will tell you what they think the reason is. Just don't put too much on and you'll be fine. I love it, I put it on my baby head to toes too, and no problems. I even use it to wash my hair because it doesn't strip every ounce of the natural protective oils and waxes from your hair. It doesn't leave any stale or dirty smell to your hair, although it will feel oilier than you are used to. I think  it gives your hair more body and volume than the most expensive fluffifying salon garbage out there. If you've used this soap before, then you know what I'm talking about. Wife is stealing my soap now.  Great soap for scalp conditions.  The scent is a bit strong but ok. You have got to try this stuff!  My wife has had dry skin problems in the past, probably a lot to do with soaps.  This product does not bother her complexion and is very mild.  From my standpoint, I work a lot outdoors a lot, in the dirt (gardening, etc. and general farm work) and I have never used a better soap.  It is very effective and lathers much more than any other product I have ever used.  We supply our water from a spring and need to be cautious and conservative with our water...........I take military-style showers, so lather is imperative.  Try this product and you will love it.  I just bought another 24-pack and have taken the soap out of the wrappers so that it will harde and last even longer.  I guess I am kind of a prepper, lol. We like this soap because we can get lather with our hard water."

283,B000X1LOJM,"I really enjoy this product.  Very gently melts away all your make up. This facial cleanse works very well. I can't use a lot of the face cleanses out there that are for removing makeup, because they are too harsh on my skin, so this works really well for me.  It takes all the makeup and oils off my face and leaves my face smooth and clean. I think its a great value for the money, and since I have sensitive skin it works well for me. I love how clean my face feels when I use this prior to the special cleansing gel.  My skin feels so clean after using it. I wear makeup, and if I don’t use oil to clean my face, my pores stay full of makeup. This product cleans my skin thoroughly, and it smells great too. My makeup goes on better when it is cleaner. Dermalogica is excellent skincare, and worth every penny to have a healthy face! This product is a good way to precleanse your face before using a face wash. Light. I have fewer breakouts, and my skin is well prepared for cleansing when I use this product. Good. This is an excellent product for both users of makeup or those that don't. The product is EXCELLENT to remove; liquid foundation,waterproof mascara, eyeshadow and long wearing lipstick.  It gently removes all the makeup in one use and prepares your face for facial cleansing products. On the days I do not wear makeup I find my face actually becomes more oily and just plain dirty from the outdoors such as car and bus exhaust, dust, pollen and smoking cigarettes. The product is excellent for removing these yucky elements before my using facial wash.I DO NOT regularly use the pre-cleanse in the morning.  I only use it at night as that is when my face needs it the most.  It is also for the propose of conserving my product.  If I could afford to I would use twice a day.  On the nights I need to use facial creams instead of moisturizer I will use the pre-cleanse before my face wash.  I have never been able to rid myself of residual cream products with just face wash and this does the trick.There have been a few times that my face was so dry that I used just this product, no face wash, and it was lovely.The cleanse smells lovely and does not make your skin smell like perfume after use.  I have very sensitive skin and have found that when I am out of the cleanse I have more breakouts.I am a regulag user of Estee Lauder, Clinique, Murad, Aveda, Lancome, and Cerave. Dermalogica is the first brand I tried, in 1994, that did not come from a drug store.  The price is higher than drug store products however only a very small product amount is necessary...for ALL their products.Just recently I have tried a new evening face wash routine. I use the pre-cleanse and follow with Clinique's 7 day scrub.  Its been two weeks and my roseca has gone into remission, black heads are going away and my small acne breakouts are gone.  My skin looks wonderful and I am happy with my new evening routine. It's the first time in years that I can use my facial creams at night, if I need to, and not suffer the side effect of clogged skin and cystic acne.  Yay!!!If you find it helpful to know I am a 45 year old Caucasian with very sensitive combination skin. I suffer from Rosacia and occasional cystic acne. I have also been a regular smoker for 30 years.  I have a few very light crows feet and NO WRIKLES. I 100% believe it is from using all of the above products since 1995.If you have any questions I will reply.I had no problems with the seller and the item that arrived is not counterfeit.  I have recently received other beauty products that I know for certain were counterfeit from other sellers. It would be nice if it was cheaper but all and all I can't complain, it brings a decent amount."
284,B000R3215W,"I use this product for facial cleansing.  It arrived on time and was wrapped very well I ordered this because I have been breaking out with eczema and some other type of rash either back to back or at the same time for a while now and it's gotten significantly worse. It itches and burns and tingles all through out the day. I vet it on my scalp and face mostly but I also get it other places on my body too at times.I ordered this. The pink one. Body wash. Shampoo and conditioner....As soon as I received this I washed my face, really lathering it up and scrubbing my brows and the most problematic areas... when i was done i rinsed and dried my face. Making sure my face wasnt still damp.I immediately felt clean and good. Normally it takes some peppermint to dot that... anyways, I went about my day and I didnt have one break out on my face. Yay!The next day I believe or two days later I washed my entire body and hair and face with all of the aveeno products I had received and felt pretty good after. I havent had a  break out in a couple days on my body or face. But on my head I can feel it flaring up every now and then but then it goes away....I will update you guys if there are any changes. But I think this will be a good thing! Woop!Oh, I gave it 4 stars because even though it did a good job at moisturizing my face... my face still feels tight like its dry. Now.. this could be a number of things and I will for sure change my review if this improves. Or if I feel like it really is the product. I have acne and most products don't well for me. Also, I had never used cream cleanser as I thought it will clog my pores because of the composition. I was introduced to Aveeno by my cousin when he got me the moisturizer. I loved how it felt on my skin and also the mild scent. So, I was convinced by the brand and decided to give the cream cleanser a try. A small quantity spread well and felt great on my skin. When combined with a sonic exfoliator brush, it does a good job of removing makeup too. I oil my skin, remove as much makeup as possible before using the product, but, we all know there are days when you just want to wash your face and fall flat on your bed. The tube lasted for about 2 months, which is great for the price.I'm not sure if this is just me, but I don't find this product easily in the stores or online. I finished my first tube and I just received my 2nd. I love it and I think I'm going to stick with it for a while. My bathroom is now Aveeno branded with the cream cleanser, body wash, and conditioner. Love this product and been using it for awhile now. Aveeno is a product you can always count on such a good product to use on your face …I like this facial cleanser! It helps keep my skin from breakouts 👍🏽 other face washes tend to strip too much of my oils or break me out. this one doesnt and helps with my cystic acne. i put in on in the begining of the shower then leave it on until it is time to wash the conditioner out of my hair I’ll be 40 & have had hormonal acne that has left scars/red marks. I’ve had one on my cheek for the last year that wouldn’t go away, I decided to try this along with the moisturizer & that red-pinkish zit/scar on my cheek is now gone. I’ve been using this for maybe a month."
285,B001E0VBDK,"Good I love this soap and I've used it for years! It's one of the best African Black soaps you can buy (and I've tried a few others). It's great for sensitive skin and lathers up nicely. A great buy for a great bar! I like it... a lot! I usually buy the Claus Porto soap(s) because they're long lasting, great scent and mild... but cost more. Was on the hunt for more soap and and saw the Nubian Heritage African Black soap listed, and decided to try it.First off- it's a great deal for 6 bars of great soap. It is also very mild... a friend taught me a trick, just touch the tip of your tongue to any wet bar of soap. Most commercial/corporate soaps will make it tingle, or burn, or leave a bad aftertaste from that small contact. This soap... nothing. No tingle, no lingering taste or burn at all.I enjoy the scent. Unusual, but that is something I look for. When I first got my shipment, the 5 bars were wrapped in a sealed plastic bag inside a paper mailing envelope. The scent seemed very strong... I could easily smell it inside the two unopened packages. I thought that I would be returning it if it was that strong. After un-wrapping, the smell quieted down (overnight) until now it's not overpowering at all, even wet in the shower. After showering, just a hint remains... at least to me.Doesn't leave my skin with that dry, no oils left (at all) on your skin feeling common to most bar soaps. I shaved with it, and worked wonderfully. No irritation and made the razor just glide.Will have to wait and see how long it lasts. One reason I buy Porto soap is because it is hard milled 7 times. Which means they run the finished soap thru rollers, compressing it and removing any voids or air 7 times. This makes the soap last a lot longer and not just melt away in the shower. Which makes Claus Porto soaps a reasonable price for how long they last.Plan on giving my friends a bar or two for their enjoyment and feedback.If it regrows the hair on my head I'll give a 5 star rating. I have had cracked and bleeding heels on both of my feet for over 5 years.  I have been to 2 dermatologists and paid for expensive prescription creams that never completely healed my feet.  The eczema started on my feet and fingers and I felt it was a chemical contact dermatitis.  I tried to protect my fingers and feet but it was a major inconvenience.  Finally, 3 months ago I bought the Nubian Heritage African Black Soap.  I was not expecting anything but a natural soap that was NOT full of synthetic chemicals.  In the past I had used Dove soap for sensitive skin and Oil of Olay for sensitive skin (which was discontinued).My heels quit bleeding and started healing while on the first bar of soap.  The eczema that had started up my calves went away within 2 weeks of using the soap.  Then I noticed that the cracked and bleeding on my thumb and forefinger had healed.  I never use lotions, as I am lazy and just forget to do it.  I had given up on the prescription as I was tired of paying $50 per tube. I did not do anything for my skin during this time.  I even went on vacation and was barefoot on the boat, beach and sidewalks.  The only thing that could have healed my feet and fingers was the Nubian Heritage african black soap.I switched to Dr Woods black african soap and before I was finished with that bar, my heels started cracking again.  So obviously, I switched back to the Nubian Heritage.  Within 1 week, my heels were looking much better and I will not switch again.The soap is black and will look black on a white wash cloth but it washes out fine.  I also have a white tile shower and it did not stain the tiles.  It lathers very well so a little soap goes a long way.  I also like the fragrance, mild but pleasant. Kay, so I had a problem with occasional pimples and things sprouting at the top of my back between my shoulder blades, sometimes up towards my neck. It wasn't too back. But it was enough to make me uncomfortable with it. I also run into this problem on my chest, though more rarely (it's more embarrassing than the back thing). And I went through TONS of reviews for soaps (not sure I remember why; I think I had seen something about African Black soap). Anyway, I had recently taken a course in Sustainability Problems (something I may regret until the end of time), which scared my sh*tless for a while about chemical-ridden, non-organic, non-natural products. So, I looked into this soap, especially since I was recently pleased with this brand's lotion, and I was pleasantly surprised that this soap is VERY good at cleaning my skin without leaving it dry and disgusting. Also, it doesn't taste that bad--if you have some on your hands in the shower and accidentally wipe your face near your mouth or whatever, it honestly tastes a bit sweet, but I don't think you'll find it necessary to gag or spit or anything. Please don't think I mean for you to eat this product.Anyway, using this soap, I have had almost no acne issues on my back/shoulders or my chest. Again, my acne was not SEVERE, so I do not know how well it will do for those of you who DO suffer from severe acne. But I have fine skin, so any and ALL of my blemishes leave scars and were exceedingly embarrassing. I am relieved that this product has cleaned my skin thoroughly enough to virtually eliminate the problem. Plus, I clean my face with it, too, since it's gentle enough.I don't have too much redness from previous blemishes left on my skin anymore; however, I can't prove that was necessarily the soap or something else. I just thought I'd mention it because I'm happy about that, too. I HIGHLY recommend this product."
286,B00120XR1G,"The texture reminds me very much of sol de janeiro bum bum cream. The scent is not the same but in a similar scent family it’s warm and hazelnutty and brown sugary/caramel-ly. There’s less of a coffee or cashmere  scent to it than sol. I used it after the ogx coffee coconut  scrub and I think it goes quite well. It’s a beautiful scent in its own right  that is intoxicating and leaves your skin oh sooooo soft. As a cream  would be too heavy for summer but this is perfect for winter. Shea butter gives me heat rash in the summer as it’s too exclusive but I’ll try the lotion version then maybe! Despite not having the caffeine ingredient this is exactly like bum bum cream in smell and texture. I think the new packaging is an effort to seem more like a bum bum dupe. I love it. Super creamy and moisturizes well. First of all I have to mention you can not beat that price for that size of bottle. Unless its due to the scent in itself, maybe its not its top pick, but either way its a great product.I originally found out about this cream years back when my father was still in the military. We were on base and the one cream I decided to try was this brand. Im very picky when it comes to lotions and creams. I also have very dry and sensitive skin (eczema along with) but I fell in love with the Alba Botanica Hawaiian Body Cream I bought. Though it was over 20 bucks for such a small container (same size as this) compared to other thick creams for extra dry skin. But those just did not compete with the smell and silky smooth texture.I decided I was going to look on amazon for this cream I love and ive been using it on my kids as well. Mostly after they have a bath I rub them down with some of this. I love it cause it smells amazing for hours on end. I honestly thought there was only one scent to this but when my packaged arrive and i opened the first one to smell it I was shocked cause it did not smell like the one I would buy. I went into my bathroom to look at the empty one to realize the one I love the best is Papaya Mango. Papaya mango was the only scent I ever saw for sale in the store and i was ecstatic to get this brand at the price it is. This one is sadly Kukui Nut. I say sadly cause im not a big fan of stuff that smells like cocoa butter. The scent of this cream reminds me of cocoa butter lotions I have tried that felt watered down thin that never quench my skin. But this cream still has the same thick consistency as my Papaya mango one so in all reality my likes of the smell will more than likely change. I tried to search for the one I now know that I like but sadly I didnt find any on Amazon  T.T  maybe one day I will have the luck of finding it on here at the same price as this one. I bought two cause its a great buy.I received mine today around 11am and i put some on my arm to check and make sure it felt the same and had the same thickness. It is 8pm now and I can still smell the scent if that helps anyone with their choice. This is my top choice in using after a long hot shower and you want to wind down and relax for the night and feel rejuvenated after. This scent is just too strong, I enjoy the Kukui oil from the brand because the scent is much more logout, but it’s too much in the cream.I can’t decide whether or not to keep or return..Also it didn’t come with a protective seal. I've been using Alba Botanica Kukui Nut body cream for many, many years and loved it.  This time around the packaging changed. The design on the jar is different. It no longer has a plastic seal on the inside and so the cream got all over the lid, but the most important problem is that the cream - it's color and consistency appears to be slightly different. I still had a partially filled jar with the old labeling, etc. and the ingredients read the same, but it looks like it is now being produced in Canada, not New York (hopefully, that doesn't make a difference), but it just doesn't seem like the cream I used to love. Maybe it is just this particular jar. I don't know. This is just as nice if not nicer than the body shop cream that I spent almost $50 a container on. I know some people don’t like this flavor but I think it’s nice. Smells really good, doesn’t leave the skin feeling like wax is on it. I use it on my whole body. I am sensitive to fragrance, and this product is JUST a little too overwhelming for me; however, as a moisturizer, it does the job perfectly, and it does not negatively affect my sensitive skin. The texture is very thick, so I apply it at night or after baths when I don’t have plans. I do not recommend for daily use, except on really dry areas of skin."
287,B000R9A56I,"This was the only moisturizer to make my face skin Not too greasy feel super smooth  and look radiant. It was the best product. Please bring it back. Why is this product no longer available. Bring it back. I tried the higher SPF and it made my skin turn creamy white and felt like wet chalk. IT IS HORRIBLE. I am looking for some other product that comes close to the SPF 15. Why do companies do this? I am not a customer of LaRoche-Posay anymore.C Denise I started using this product 15 years ago after reading an article in Vogue magazine about an older woman who had amazing skin. She attributed her beautiful skin to this product and microdermabrasion. It was that simple.I’ve used it every single day for the 15 years. It’s a great moisturizer and base line sunscreen.  (If in the sun for an extended period the I double up with a mineral sunscreen.) There’s no other product that comes close. I cannot believe that this product is no longer available. Please please please bring this back! I have used this product for years!  I have all of my family and friends use it.  However I am more aware and focused on ingredients and chemicals that I put in and on my body.  One of the reviews was a little disturbing.  It was from 2009.  Has any progress been made to replace the harmful ingredients?  I would love to keep buying this moisturizer!Here is the negative review:TOXIC chemicals in the ""best sunscreen""December 9, 2009This product contains Octocrylene, which ""can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer. This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA DAMAGE and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-users."" This is from a peer-reviewed, science journal.The other active ingredient, avobenzone, easily penetrates the skin and is a strong free radical generator as well.The whole purpose of sunscreen is to protect you from damage, not CAUSE it.A much safer option is a sunblock - zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. They are photostable when exposed to radiation-aka sun rays and scatter the light rather than absorb it. They also protect BOTH kinds of harmful sun rays(UVA and UVB).FYI: you should also avoid sunscreens containing PABA (causes breakouts and a possible carcinogen) and any other benzene compounds. I have very fair skin, red hair and burn under office fluorescent lights so, yep, I'm a vampire. That office lights quip might not be true but it is true that I always burn outside. I wanted something to wear daily on my face under my makeup to mitigate any damage I might be doing to my face by just being outside at lunch or driving in the car. After some research, I purchased this product due to it containing Mexoryl which from all accounts is said to protect better against UV.I'm extremely happy with this sunscreen. Even though it is only SPF 15, I haven't burned once on my face or my ears. Yeah, that's right, my ears! I'm a vampire, remember? I'm also able to skip the morning moisturizer because this combines the two. It does feel like regular moisturizer as it goes on. I usually use Neutrogena Naturals moisturizer and it feels similar. You don't have to use very much to cover your face so I imagine this tube lasting all summer for me. I only use it on my face because 1) it is expensive and 2) my face and ears are my most burn prone areas. Before I put my makeup on, I let it dry a bit. Usually by the time I get the rest of my clothes on and get ready to paint the face, the sunscreen has dried. Also, I didn't have any white or ashy residue like I'm reading about from other facial specific sunscreens.Last Sunday, as an example, I put the sunscreen on, went to a Little League game outside in the morning, mowed the lawn in the afternoon and grilled out at about 5:00pm. I didn't reapply the sunscreen at all during the day and I had absolutely no sunburn or even any redness. The only sunscreen in America formulated with both Ecamsule AND Avobenzone filters for truly broad spectrum and photo stable UVA protection.The SPF 15 rating only applies to UVB attenuation, which belies the superior wavelength coverage of this formulation.Other non-mineral sunscreens employ just Avobenzone, with various UVB filters, which leaves a gap in the mid-spectrum UVA range. Their protection also tends to break down since Avobenzone is fragile when formulated without multiple stabilizers.Non-scented. Lightly moisturizing. Perfect to put on every morning. I wore this on my face for a week of punishing sun at Burning Man and came home with barely a tan.Mineral based sunscreens may offer great protection, but are usually heavy and never pleasant to wear, especially for a man. Chemical sunscreens offer inadequate protection from penetrating long wavelength ultraviolet.Anthelios SX is simply superior. Most moisturizers are not thick enough for me and I prefer one that has some oil in it which this does.  The east coast is so try and our skin is terribly dry.  I *really* like this brand and am very fussy and have tried many, many brands.  Will keep buying and also got the body moisturizer which is great too. I have struggled to find a moisturizer with spf that doesn't have that chemical sunscreen smell. Even the smell of zinc oxide bothers me. This has no sunscreen odor whatsoever and it did not make me break out, which is an issue I've had with other spf moisturizers.It's a little thicker/creamier than I'd like--I'd prefer it to absorb more and be a little more lightweight--but I'm chalking that up to my super oily skin and giving it a 5 star rating anyway.  There is a version that's not a moisturizer, but I do need some moisturizing or else my skin gets flaky."
288,B0002FBOLW,"11/10/2010-Atoplam MLE Intensive Moisturizing Cream USED to be the best cream ever created for even the most sensitive of skins. I ordered the new larger size jar, 3.4 FL OZ, last week, and I immediately slathered it all over my face as usual and it started to burn and I noticed an offensive, new fragrance. The new version of the cream is similar yet not as moisturizing as the original formula. I looked at the ingredients and researched online and ATOPALM MLE CREAM has indeed reformulated the cream recently and now contains a sandalwood or some other ""woodsy"", irritating fragrance. The new version of the cream no longer felt as cooling and calming. However, my skin is hyper-sensitive, fair, dry, and irritable though so I am SUPER weary of fragrances and minor ingredient changes...Anyway, just a heads a up for those who do purchase the cream frequently. I am so bummed. How could they alter perfection? I'm sad. Seriously, it was the only face cream that did not burn or irritate my face...Update 09/02/2011. I found a new cream by Skinscientifica that is possibly even better than the original Atopalm. I will insert a link to the skin cream (item) on Amazon. Good luck! I purchased a private brand barrier cream from my dermatologist's office for use after a chemical peel.  The product worked so well and I loved how quickly my skin healed.  I've struggled for years with eczema all over my body and was using prescription topicals to try to get it under control.  I used some of the barrier cream and it practically healed overnight.  I did a little research online on the ingredients and found my dermatologist was actually repackaging ATOPalm MLE.  Caliderma is also repackaged ATOPalm MLE with a higher price tag.  I can only say I will use this stuff for life along with the body lotion. I have used Atopalm for 2 years and love it.  I was getting dry and red patches on my eyelids and neck area.  Nothing was helping until I tried Atopalm.  It worked like a charm and have not had a recurrence.  Was using philosophy before but it never helped my skin.  I order from cosmetic planet and in last weeks order they sent me a little surpise, a free small travel jar of atopalm, so nice of them. I got a free sample of this with a recent Amazon order, and ordered more as soon as I'd tried it for a week. Cannot believe how well this product works. It's absorbed immediately and your skin it doesn't glisten or feel like clay after using it (as with Cetaphil's moisturizer.) I hope its not possible to build up a resistance to it (dermatitis). This is the product to replace your Cetaphil with if you're not happy with that stuff.Miraculous. I have roceasa and have had for 20 plus years plusvery dry sensitive skin. This mle cream is amazing. I ordered it from Canada for many years before select vendors now have it on line in the U.S. I really can't be without it or their foaming cleanser. This has saved my skin. This is the ultimate moisturizer! It is not greasy, and absorbs very quickly. I have been using it for about a month now- and my hands- which were very dry and 'aged', now look better! I have tried so many creams on the market- this is the first one that truly keeps my hands moist most of the day with one application. I highly recommend this product. I use this night and morning on the psoriasis on my elbows, and since I have been using it the psoriasis has completely gone on the right, and almost completely gone on the left. Tried ATOPALM on one elbow and a regular drugstore brand cream on the other after a month I didn't see any difference except my wallet was a little lighter. I can buy 3 of the cheaper creams and get the same benefit as if I spent three times as much. Not for me."
289,B00127O510,"I absolutely love the way it makes his skin feel, and it smells amazing! good overall quality cleansing product with faint scent and too little moisturizer affect. Mild fresh smell. Sensitive to the skin Does the job.  No exaggeration on product quality. Good product but a little harder to rinse off than others Used for years now.  Gentle on skin and not heavily fragrant. My husband use it because has sensitive skin. He recommend it. I've tried a number of different men's body washes and this is my go to from now on."
290,B001C4Q3UY,"The first time I purchased this product, I was simply curious as to whether or not it would help control/improve my skin and acne. I have very sensitive oily/combination skin (chin, nose, and cheeks are oily, but the rest of my face is dry) with hormonal acne on top of that and the first use of Elicina brought with it a notable softness. The first thing I noticed was that there was no smell at all, and the second was that although it was thick and creamy, it spread far and absorbed fast. It did not get rid of my acne, but I noticed that any outbreak would heal up before it could really get started and it reduced a lot of the red pigment from much older outbreaks that just wouldn't go away. I applied Elicina twice daily on clean skin until my jar ran out for a little more than one month. I ordered a second jar a couple days before my first one ran up and that second jar is not odorless. It has a strange chemical/slightly tea tree smell to it and the one time I used it before I noticed the smell, it left my skin feeling dry and tight. Since I don't want to gamble more money on another, hopefully less smelly jar, I've decided to try out one of South Korea's many perfume, colorant, and paraben free snail creams. i had trouble with my skin and break  outs since teen yrs found this on EBAY in 2000 used it 2x day and then I got laser resurfacing for scars but the procedure scarred me in one area on my cheek in a line.Where I wasn't scarred !  HE messed up!SO MAD. !!I thought I was doomed. I began using ORIGINAL Snail Elicina Cream 2x -3x a day , I  rub it on the area affected AND on my forehead horizontal wrinkles and AFTER using this ALONG with my ""NEVER BE  WITHOUT  ""SMOOTHIE WRINKLE REMOVER Strips"" SOLD HERE , 2 of  3  deep Forehead wrinkles ARE FULLY Gone!!!NO MORE trips for Botox for over 2 yrs now.FOR SCARs..i rub in cream,  top it  off with small amount of  AHA 12% night soufflé cream sold here, wait till dry, then applymy Smoothie wrinkle remover strips on the scars or wrinkles i want to not get again and keep Smoothie on forhead each night though thye are gone so they don't return.What it DOES IS  LIFTS the SCAR or Wrinkle UP,  from being de-pressed down in to the skin and brings it up  to surface matching your other skin that is not scarred or wrinkled!IVE  started back using this over a week and ALREADY the SCAR made by plastic surgeon from laser resurfacing  is almost gone!!AND Forehead deepest wrinkles, 2 of 3 are GONE!That's result of Using the ""Smoothie Wrinkle Strips and using AHA ""  before applying the strips on eye corners and forehead wrinkles.OH!!!  AND I don't have CROWS FEET ANY MORE.Whether I smiled or not I had faint lines at eye edges and have been using the SMOOTHIE WRINKLE STRIPS EACH NIGHT FOR 3 MONTHS, I wish I knew of in these in my 20s or 30s  ,but at mid 40s, NO ONE  believes  my age and guesses me at 10-15 yrs  less and im in mid 40s.Strangers  too, not friends who try to tell you what you want to hear.I go by what strangers say when i get asked about what  i use on my skin cause they say its FLAWLESSME the one time 20 yr old with ACNE filled Skin and scars, WELL NO MORE.Now im told i have AMAZING CLEAR FLAWLESS SKIN???  Makes me look around to see whom they are asking LOLl don't  need to wear makeup and use SPF 45 when out, I use the  yellow jar of STRIVECTIN FROM QVC for THROAT and décolleté area.I just discovered  that TRULY FIRMS and tightens neck , those that have neck bands or wrinkles in décolleté,  bring the cream up to your jaw and a bit over and it does REALLY FIRM  Jowl AREA if u have that starting .I use a 40% home Glycolic acid peel for 4 min for over 3 yrs now.I use what the Drs use in office adn charge 100 bucks a peel.I buy from SKIN Store rx, or google glycolic home peel, rnages from 20% to 50%, start at 20% as i ddi and you will flake off old dead skin and wrinkles and reveal new smoother skin.USE once a week then after bottle empty go to 30% then so on to 50 % adn go from 1 min to 5 minutes where im at now.AMAZING RESULTS.I use and belevie in ARGAN pure oil and use it after each peel adn skin sucks it in.Bought on QVC .I worked up to  50% and my Plastic surgeon CANNOT BELEIVE THE SKIN I HAVE WHEN I WAS THE GIRL ON ACCUTANE in HSCHOOL And suffered from cystic acne that scarred my cheeks.My acne continued as a late bloomer and then STOPPED.I got laser face resurfaced  that took off 4 layers of skin and was painful YET I still had some scars left if you looked close,Then I saw it here again and thought HMMM??What would happen if I added SNAIL  Cream I knew worked,  into my Skin Regime of glycolic peels for wrinkles gone and AHA cream , while using SMOOTHIE WRINKLE LIFT STIPS on any visible wrinkles?WELL I found my REGIME GAVE RESULTS I NEVER THOUGHT i would  EVER HAVE a Chance AT !You need to be Consistent and if and when  you PEEL AFTER a treatment ,  use Derma new home microbrasion cream or the neutrogena kits to slough off DEAD SKIN .You need to get it off so it does not clog pores, your NEW baby wrinkle less is revealed , glowing , smooth and zit FREE and wrinkle FREE.KEEP AT IT, remember we didn't get wrinkles or scars over night and cant expect ANY natural treatments to work overnight.I plan to now get  Botox  WHY?BECAUSE my wrinkles have diminished to the point that i don't hardly have any so it will be to use it preventively to ward off muscles re creating what i just worked on removing naturally.Once the BOTOX  stops muscles from creating those lines again, i wont get them back and can ease off some of what i use.BOTOX works best on new wrinkles forming or medium wrinkles, but  i found a regime that naturally reduced my wrinkles and scars to almost not visible or invisible and to get BOTOX NOW  will prevent muscle from RE creating those wrinkles again.ITs like a Re START Button back in time !GOOD LUCK!! I live in Utah and the air is very dry here, so this isn't moisturizing like I hoped it would be. I was hoping it would be more creamy and rich, but it feels much lighter and doesn't moisturize my skin well. That being said, I think this is a great lotion to use in place of a primer since it feels like it covers pores and gives a nice even skin texture. Plus it isn't greasy, and I think it has been helping with blemishes. Overall, I feel like it isn't a bad product, but if you want to buy it for moisture, then buy something else. For over 10 years the cream is a permanent item in our household.  Helps by burning, superficial wounds...we use it for almost everything. Recommend to my family and friends and they are also happy with the results of the cream. I truly recommend it to anyone. I don't usually write reviews for products but this one was so amazing that I had to share. The thought of snail extract on my skin was kinda icky but I figured since I've tried eveything else including prescriptions from my dermatologist, that I would try one more thing. I have sensitive skin and I am a very light toned black woman that has been suffering from acne since my teenage years and when the acne subsides, I am usually left with dark spots. I have tried Ambi, Esoterica, Palmers, Black&White, Black Opal, Clinique and a few others but the spots would slightly fade in six weeks. But when I would get another breakout....more spots would appear!!! It was frustrating to say the least and I had to keep putting on the products longer than suggested use. THIS CREAM, THIS WONDERFUL CREAM!!! Though I literally just started using it lastnight can definately say that I will never stop using this cream. I had a forest of acne on my forehead lastnight. I went through my usual routine of washing my face with castile soap then applied my aloe vera juice as a toner and then used the Elicina cream  a little goes a long way) I woke up this morning and went into the bathroom to wash my face and noticed that the acne forest was gone. So my thought is, if it rids you of the acne and leaves no dark spots to fade then this product is also a preventative cream as well.  My skin feels so soft right now and I am excited to see what the end result is gonna be. I will definately be keeping stock and suggest that everyone does the same. I'm really shocked!!!"
291,B000F6UJ32,"Tempted to give 3 stars, but trying to be fair.  First impression was that smell was unpleasant.  Scent was not offensive, but disappointing. almost SLIGHTLY rancid aroma.  ( However, not accusing company of selling a rancid product.)  By that I mean, I was expecting an almond scent.  Yes, realize that this product is organic.  However, if I can buy organic almond extract for baking, imho, it can be added to make product more aroma appealing.  I would not object if company added non organic almond extract, if this was the only non organic element.I applied to recent problem of dry hands.  Wish that I could say that application was silky, it was not.  Perhaps this is due to its organic nature.  I applied in a small amount, but had to reapply another small amount to get product evenly distributed.  Product did not disappear into skin, as expected, and left a somewhat oily residue, until my hands required washing, several hours later.  Hang on, this is not necessarily a bad thing.....Normally, hand washing essentially strips any protective lotion that I have applied.  However, three hand washings later, my hands still felt soft.  I intend on using this product before sleeping at night, and will wash hands in warm water first, to assure that pores are open for optimal absorption.  As for daytime use, unless it is my day off, and at home, will likely have to use only at night in warmer weather.  I will update come winter, if disappointed, but feel that this product would be highly desirable in winter, at the start of one's day due to its longevity.  I have already decided that come winter, if I need a touch up in mid day, to store a small amount of product in travel size container, in my purse.Company does provide the necessary dark bottle to protect from the light.  However, would like to see an expiration or use by date on bottle.  NOT accusing this company of any wrong doing what so ever.  I just want the company to understand that the one benefit that we lack on Amazon with many of these type products not being from a major retailer, is the standards of their inventory control. This Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil 4 oz is really and truly a lovely oil. The texture is indescribable in it's luxury and the fragrance is a light nutty almond. I use it after every single shower because it leaves my skin protected and very soft. I ran out of the 4 ounce size that I first bought quickly. I bought that first wonderful bottle at D. M. E. Online Sales Inc. through Amazon.I ordered another 4 ounce bottle through Amazon from Red TAG sale. I like 4 ounces because it's a size that won't go stale in summer weather. Anyway, I was shocked that although the bottle and color of the oil within were the same as the first order the scent and the texture were not. I thought that there was something wrong with my nose that it should smell so bad! It's not really a rancid smell so much as a weird, unpleasant smell that the new bottle of Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil has...like a yucky (as opposed to nice), poisonous burnt wood smell. And, the texture was thinner, a lot less wonderful. In short, I am not using it. I called Whole Foods here in Vancouver, WA and asked if they carry Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil 4 oz. The girl said yes and that it sells for only 5.99. So, I guess I'm both applauding and, yet, warning about purchasing this brand of sweet almond oil, at least online. RED TAG sale sold me something not at all like what I first got from D. M. E. sales. IF you must buy online try D. M. E. online sales! I will not buy from Red Tag sale again.So, I give Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil itself five stars because the first bottle I got was just exquisite. I don't think the 2nd bottle reflected on the manufacturer (in Germany) but that the seller RED TAG sale likely is selling old oil or even adulterated oil. Add some of the almond all to your lotion routine and watch it work.Soft skin, wonderful smell and a shine(especially on your legs like you will never believe. Very smooth and non-greasy. I use this as an all over body moisturizer once or twice per week for dry skin.  You do need to wait about 5-10 minutes for it to absorb into the skin after showering, so don't use it when you're in a hurry to get dressed (not oily after it's absorbed).  However, it's worth the extra time because you'll immediately notice how hydrated your skin feels with one use.  And the effect seems to last for several days without using any other products after showering.  One tip - don't purchase an oil where sweet almond oil is combined with several other oils, I've found pure sweet almond oil by itself works much better. Love this organic sweet almond oil for my skin.  There is no scent but I use a few drops of organic essential orange oil & it’s great! Recently discovered that this organic oil is refined so I took away 2 stars. The unrefined organic sweet almond oil is more hydrating. This is a wonderful all organic oil!  I bought it to make my own lip balm.  It is a dream to use!  The Almond smell is not overpowering at all.  The bottles are a bit small but depending on your needs, they may last a while....I made a lot of lip balm with maybe a 1/2 bottle.  A lot!  Enough for the year I should think!  It's great for whatever your natural needs are!  I will certainly purchase this again when I run out!  Good for the environment.  Good for you!  No nasty toxic chemicals that cause allergies & sickness!  Just pure Organic Oil.  What could be better? This oil is absolutely wonderful for the first week of your baby's life. By using this oil you don't have to continue to rub your baby's bottom to get the poop off that is like tar. He was specially don't want to continue to rub your baby's bottom as it will make it red. By using this you can wipe off everything in one or two swipes."
292,B00147FGJ8,"Thought this product would be much darker than the Australian brand I was using, but that is not the case even though it says...Paint It Black! Not so much and I already had a good tan going, just wanted to enhance it a bit. It does work OK, smells OK and lasts a fair amount of time, just wasn't as dark as I wished it was. Would I buy again? Maybe? Make the formula darker and you got me. Good product. I have purchased ""Paint it Black 50X"" for the past two years. I don't tan easily using a tanning bed.  ""Paint it Black"" will give you a nice bronze tan after only one tanning bed visit. I use a Men's moisturizing lotion after tanning. The price/value is excellent as one bottle lasts a long time. Highly recommend this product! I use to tan all the time a couple of years ago and started up again in November, 2012.  Of course, I got sucked into buying a $75.00 bottle of lotion at the salon when I signed up with their ""discount.""  The product I bought was Jwoww Black Bronzer.  I loved the smell and it seemed to work fine.  For some reason, I did not even think to look on Amazon for lotions.  And I was beyond perturbed when I saw the same JWoww lotion on here for $20.00 and sometimes less.  So, I swore I would never buy from the salon again.  As I went in during the past couple months I would write down what they considered their ""high end"" $100.00 lotions and started looking around on here.  I found most of them on here from the $15.00 - $30.00 range (again, a bit upset with myself for falling for the salon girls).  I figured, since they are so ""cheap"" compared to the salon online, I can afford to actually try different ones.  After reading, this one seemed to be one of the higher rated, and most bought.  The ones for $100.00 at the salon actually did not have stunning reviews.  I ordered this late morning Tuesday (2/5/13) - and received it very quickly (today, Friday 2/8/13, in the morning).  I was so curious so I hopped in the truck and went tanning.  It was very smooth to put on and I do not use nearly as much as I had to with the JWoww because it is not so thick - I think it is the silicone that makes it easier to apply.  So right off the bat, I knew that I would not fly through this product as it seemed with the JWoww.  When I got out of the tanning bed, I looked in the mirror and realized I was brown (I already had a very nice tan that I have been working on in the beds for the past few months).  But I realized at that moment I was actually orangish from the JWoww - - I was impressed by this color.  And as far as the smell, I know everyone's body chemistry is different, but all I smell is Vanilla after tanning.  It smells so good still and it has been a few hours.  I guess I will know for sure if it happens to be bad after a few more sessions, but I can already tell that it is great.  They wanted $68.00 for this lotion at my salon, I got it for $14.95 with free Prime shipping on here.  You cannot beat it and it is the same stuff at the salon.  Hope this helps!  I recommend highly. Liked this product I bought this to help get a base tan started before I vacationed in Florida. It worked pretty well for me and my skin type is quite pale with freckles. OH WOW...Best tanning lotion by far I have ever used and through the years I used a lot...I am just so excited to tell you about this product..by the way thank you reviewers you are the best....I first of all I did not want to write a review until I  had a chance to use it a few times to be exact 3... I tan outside I have very fair skin.... I did have a little bit of color before I started using this lotion but after the three times I have this most awesome  dark tan... I usually just get a golden tan... but by using this lotion I have a nice dark golden tan... I don't even have a pool I used my sprinkler to cool myself down... I've never been so insistent about all of you using this tanning lotion because it works and believe me I would tell you if it didn't it also makes your skin so soft.. the smell is a sweet tropical... I don't understand why some people said it smelled because mine did not.. it  smelled fresh... they must have got a bad batch or something... but anyway I'm really really recommending this product''UPDATE: I have bought 3 bottles now I've only used one and a half I have to say I still love this stuff... one thing I want you do know is that I am fair-skinned and I have a nice tan and I have not burned at all when using this lotion.. I feel the heat from the Sun but it's got like a barrier or something... I have never had lotion that has done that... anyway I hope you have the same experience.. I feel I am ready to use the 100x solid black.. I will let you know how that goes !! Enjoy the rest of your summer! 😎👍👍 Worked okay when it was used, but thatcwas almost 10 years ago."
293,B00120VWRW,"have been buying for years. this purchase with the new yellow and green tube has slightly larger grains that it used to. still works better than anything else I've tried, though, and the formula itself feels the same. I use this on my sensitive aging skin several times a week to keep it smooth and looking even. the new packaging with the scrubber top is just silly. I hope they go back to the smaller grains, they are impossible to find in any other product. I think the scrub itself is OK. It's inexpensive, has a subtle, pleasant scent, and is a good, fine-grained scrub. However, for me, the attached brush is a dealbreaker. I specifically ordered a view of the product that did not have the brush pictured because I didn't want it, but apparently, that doesn't exist anymore. The plastic brush is too harsh along with with the scrub, and there is no removing it. As mentioned in other reviews, you must remove the clear cap, twist the brush part open, squeeze the tube to dispense the product, twist the brush part closed, wash all the product out of the brush part, and the replace the clear cap. The product won't sit upright without the cap, and there is no way around the plastic brush. Too bad; it ruins a product with a good value. I like this product but I've decided I no longer want to purchase things in plastic tubes that go into the landfill once empty. Why can't they use glass or cardboard? I will gladly keep purchasing if they switch to non-plastic! I like the fine and plentiful granules of this scrub. What I don’t understand is why there is a brush on the end of the tube where the scrub comes out. I never use it because the scrub is sufficient in itself without using a brush. Probably would not buy again since I’m sure the brush adds to the cost of the product and I like to keep things as simple as possible. With this product you have to remove the clear cap, twist the top to open, squeeze out the scrub which leaves some scrub embedded in the brush, then twist close the top, rinse the brush, and replace the clear cap (which is slippery when wet so I usually end up feeling around for it on the shower floor.) Was surprised by how much I liked this scrub. Bought it because it was fairly cheap and needed to replace my Alba Acnedote scrub (which I love, but hate paying so much for a face wash). You squeeze some of this onto the end, which is like a dermabrasion base, then scrub it around on your face. Then I used my fingers to make sure I got my whole face and rinsed off. It was a little hard to handle in the shower once it was on my face and I needed to put the bottle down, but couldn't open my eyes since I still had it on my face but wanted to give it an extra scrub with my fingers. Other than that it was great. My face looked extra fresh after that shower. Will probably only use 1-2 x per week. Product came as pictured and I have not been able to exchange it. My teenage daughter and I use this face wash daily and have been for years now.  It's less expensive to buy on Amazon than at our grocery store where it is also available.  If you have very sensitive skin it might not be good for you as it is mildly abrasive.  On the packaging I think it says to use a few times per week, but again, we use it daily without issue. I love that this brand is plant based, cruelty free and really deep cleaned your pores! It smells nice and the price won’t hurt your wallet! I would recommend giving it a try."
294,B000NRVG26,"I love how there is a variety of scents and oil that have different benefits for the skin. I have mixed some into my homemade body butter and it is amazing! I’d recommend grabbing these when you can. They aren’t greasy and are small enough to take on the go. Will definitely be buying again soon! It smells good Me encanta !!’ I like this for the arthritis in my fingers I paid for 10 bottles, the payment went through, and only one was shipped. And unpadded,  so it arrived smashed. Amazon service levels are slipping.***Update: I had an online chat with Maxx and the whole amount was refunded with no need to return the one with a broken box. I will donate that one to someone who needs it, as it was free to me. Maxx was a peach. The refund was in my account the next morning. Good save, Amazon, and good hiring, training, and customer service decisions upstream, too.4 out of 5 stars instead of 5/5 for the effort, time, and patience needed from me to resolve this.*** The best Arnica oil out there! Bought these for my mama at a great price. She loves weleda as do I.  Arnica is the best for muscle recovery and pain and she rubs this on her feet and says the pain is gone after that. Also. Love the smell. I always buy loads of weleda when I visit family in Germany. So cheap there! I ordered two types of cellulite products at the same time. The first one was aveno firming and toning gel. It did help but I wanted to give this one a try. I had used Birch Cellulite oil years ago but couldn’t remember why I stopped. First it smells great…a light citrus scent. They’ve added a pump which is great because glass bottle + oil = slippery. It did help reduce the appearance of the cellulite but in my opinion it didn’t moisturize very well. I’d walk around for a couple of hours like an oily mess and a couple more later my skin was no longer moisturized. In addition it didn’t seem to go very far...I had to use a lot because my skin was soaking it up like a sponge…it would sink in rather than spread around. i went through the whole bottle in 2 weeks which would make it very pricy. I started mixing it with a small amount of cetephil cream both to add more long term  moisture and to make it go a little further. But of course I think that dilutes the strength so it may not be working as well as it could. I will continue to use it and rotate with the aveno which is cheaper and a little goes a lot further."
295,B0015KO3LQ,"I love the fact that it's overnight.. I mean think about it.. we usually sleep at night with nothing in our hair.. and you put this on and it actually does something! But okey it's not a miracle.. it does help the hair to be softer and less frizzy the next night.. and if you use it everyday you will get that result.. but if your hair is very frizzy (like mine.. that's long, straight and frizzy).. it won't end ALL the frizz, just some of it.Nonetheless, i do see some difference on the days that I use it.. actually if it wasn't just for night it's pretty good on your hair alone... once I put it on to sleep and had to go out fast.. didn't do much to my hair and it looked  pretty well with it! haha!It dries up pretty fast, you don't feel like there's anything in your hair, so it won't leave stains.So it's a good product but don't expect it to change your hair or leave it all new and soft and shiny.. just maybe a littlebit.. I think that's fine since it's not that expensive. I ordered this product to reduce frizz and transform my dry, slightly frizzy hair into ""smooth, glossy"" hair.  When I applied it the first night, my hair looked and felt amazing.  I couldn't stop touching it.  However by the next morning, it didn't look like I had applied anything at all the night before.  I'm sorry to say it didn't transform my hair.  Actually, my hair looked drier than normal, although that could have just been my perception because I read rave reviews and was expecting more from this product.I next tried applying it in the morning before heading to work.  That's not what the bottle directed, but I thought it would be ok.  My hair looked great when I walked out the door, but by lunch, the look/feel was gone and my hair looked extremely dry and not as smooth.  It still felt good though which was a plus...I guess.  Since the morning application was a bust, I went back to applying it at night as recommeneded.  The Overnight Repair Formula didn't hurt my hair, but I honestly felt it didn't do much for it either.  I hate to waste money so I used the entire bottle, but I wouldn't buy it again. This product is a dream come true. I have used it in it my hair overnight and true to its word, no residue is left on the pillow. It's also very light so I don't have to shampoo it out the next day. It's also very versatile; I comb it through clean, damp hair and let it dry naturally or sprunch as I blow dry, and I get pretty, soft, nice-smelling waves. It's also great to use on dry hair when you notice a little frizz. I've been using the serum for close to a month now. It's definitely helped improve the overall condition of my hair, and I am seeing less split ends and less breakage. I've also been improvising and using a small dab when my hair is damp, and noticed it helps keep my style from being frizzy. It smells pretty good, and I'd definitely recommend this to anyone with dry, damaged hair. You'll need to use it consistently, but I bet you'll see an improvement the very first time you use it! My 2 year old daughter has very curly hair that rapidly frizzes. I've tried many different products on her (Frizz Ease day serum, Redken Anti-Snap, Sebastian Potion 9) and this is our favorite, by far. I actually put it in right after her bath when her hair is still wet. It dries soft and curly in little ringlets, without any stiffness. I have put it in her dry hair a few times and it noticeably improves it, but I prefer to use it as a styling/smoothing cream instead of the many serums we've tried. I love it! I have thick, medium length hair that tends to feel rough underneath from split/dry ends.  The first time I used this product, I applied to the ends, tied it back and went to sleep.  When I was drying my hair the next day, I was absolutely amazed at how soft and smooth my hair felt.  I got so many compliments on my hair that day (and I was long overdue for a cut)!  It really is great and I use it any time my hair feels rough.  It is so worth getting! Received quickly in good condition.  This product is very nice on your hair.  My hair is very fine and has been damaged due to coloring and heat.  I do notice my hair feels softer and looks a little better after using it overnight.  It is not a miracle cure for the damage I have but it does help. This is a good cream for someone that needs added moisture. Not the best product I have used, but I actually use it when I get out of the shower, not at night. I mix it with my hair serum and it is a light way to add some hydration to your hair. It also smells very nice."
296,B000GR9OIQ,"Smells fresh felt clean Not a strong scent but very lovely. I bought this body wash from Amazon as a way to save some money at the local store. It arrived quickly in a cardboard Old Spice box containing all of the 18oz bottles. The bottles' tops were all still securely closed.For staying at home, these are perfect. The tops are easy to open (flip top that secures with friction) and don't come undone on their own during the life of a single bottle. For travel though you may want to look elsewhere. While I have yet to have a problem with them, they do seem as though they could be opened relatively simply as there is a small lip on the front of the flip top for your fingers which could easily get caught on something in a travel bag. For this reason, if you are traveling with this, I recommend placing it in a zip lock bag or other container so that if it does open, you will not have your other items ruined as well.In terms of scent, this product is potent but very nice. Whenever I get out of the shower, my girlfriend is quite happy to just lay nearby so that she can smell it. I know that won't be true of all women, but I would definitely rate this as a pleasant smell that can last nicely. When paired with the Pure Sport deodorant, this is a great all day combination. Love I will say I love the Old Spice products especially the Pure Sport Clear Gel deodorant. It is all I will use and is sometimes hard to find. If anyone from Old Spice wants to send me one, two, a case I would be forever grateful. I was happy to try the body wash and add it to my morning routine. I knew I would like the scent because I regularly sport it under my arms all day. It has a great clean and refreshing feeling that says I am ready to start my day even if that involves facing a classroom full of 4th graders. The scent is not too overpowering and this bottle will last a long time before you have to resupply. If anyone is looking for a clean and refreshing body this is the wash for you. Love this stuff it gets you clean. Let's be honest though, does it matter if we like the smell? No, not really. The wife thinks it smells great, which is really all that matters. On the cleaning side, of course that matters, this stuff lathers well and really gets me squeaky clean even with the hard water that we have here. I love that this is available on Amazon.com's Subscribe and Save program. I just make sure that each shipment has 5 or more items in the Subsribe and Save cart and BAM 15% off! that is cheaper than W**-M***Just sayin people, this is good, cheap and works! Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Men's Body Wash 18 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)Supposed to be for men but the whole family enjoys this body wash.  This  scent forces the  body to smell great, even when it doesn't want to.  My stinky husband after being out working all day in the Florida sun.  Leaves the shower and smells great for hours.  This is our favorite its refreshing with a great lather, the hydration from the gel leaves skin smooth and not  dry. And no residue on the skin.  Great product that we subscribe to.  Love it. Boyfriend likes it."
297,B001FB5IIC,"it was delivered so quick ...I love this stuff my skin is so sensitive and dry. This is very thick, think thick Crisco. But think comforting and lasting! I have used it for years and will continue to it is my standby lotion. There is a thinner version of this with the turquoise stripe on the label. It is thinner and works well too.... Best stuff on my face!!!!! The dark spot peeled right off after 2 days leaving a lighter spot!!!!!  It is getting lighter with continuous use!  Evens out my skin tone and softer skin! Nothing works like this product on my dry feet.  I even bought a cheap pack of thin sacrificial footies for daytime under my good socks and for night to protect my sheets.  Very creamy and not overly oily.  Treat yourself to the best! I have used Eucerine for almost 4 decades. It was given to my late father-in-law, at Dartmouth Medical (NH), way back then. He had raging psoriasis. They couldn’t fins a cause, after a full week of tests, but the Eucerine helped some. He went home with a suggestion that he quit drinking.  He loved his whiskey, but when he quit, the psoriasis cleared up completely!  My husband’s friend had a hobby of deep sea fishing. He had cracks deep in his hands. The blood was visible. (Very dangerous!). Eucerine healed those cracks completely, in a week.  I had a fiancé (after marriage), whose heels had cracks as dangerously deep as the fisherman. He covered his heels with a thick coat of Eucerine and wore plastic bags to keep the moisture in. One week an he was good as new. A friend who was about 15 years older than me had a chronic itch on the skin of her back. I tried to introduce her to Eucerine. But she didn’t like the greasy feeling Ter she rubbed it in. This is the number 1 complaint I hear, when I introduce this magical healing creme to friends. And I can swear on my very life that the greasy feeling is gone in ten minutes, BUT THE MOISTURE STAYS AND HEALS CRACKS AND. FLAKING. THEY WON’T LISTEN. But one day, I came home to find my elder housemate bopping around the living room in agony. She begged me to help her make her back stop itching!  And babbled and bounced around, until I got the Eucerine and applied it generously. Almost instantly, she felt relief. I gave her my jar for the night. The next day, she bought her own jar! For my feet, it clears up cracks and flakes and leaves my feet looking very youthful.  I also use it on my face. For years, people thought I was 10 or more years younger than I was. The desert sun has caught up with me now, but I always look younger, after I apply the Eucerine. I have tried other Eucerine preparations. Only the ORIGINAL HEALING CRÈME for VERY DRY, SENSITIVE SKIN, works for me. And for most toiletries, nd OTC meds, generics are fine, but not Eucerine. The generic doesn’t even come close. I stock up, when it’s on sale. It lasts for years! I'm 34 and have been using this cream daily, since I was a child. I especially can't live without it in winter (I'll crack), and haven't found another moisturizing product that holds up. Pay dry when getting out of the shower and apply for best benefits. This is one of the most consistent products I use for my medically troublesome skin. My last order, however, had one of the tubs perfect and the other’s seal was broken. I’m horrible at sending back, but saw shipping has been a problem so I figured I’d mention it. Good product but very heavy to apply. If youcan apply with your hands - no problem.Prefer Cera Ve because you can squirt fromthe bottle to an applicator to teach your back area easier. My child suffers from severe eczema and is quite sensitive to fragrances and to the feel of lotions/creams. I have gone through a lot of creams and lotions and this one is the ONLY one that not only promotes healing, but also does not cause any sensitivity reactions. Great product!!"
298,B001FB5NTG,"I use this more in the winter time when my skin is really dry. I love it!!! It leaves my skin hydrated and soft with a light scent. yasssssssss! I absolutely love this product, but I was buying 4 for 25.00 and now I see they have doubled the price, but there are cheaper options from a different seller, so I'm switching sellers. I'm not spending $50!! Wouldn’t buy anything else I originally only received 1 bottle when it was supposed to be a 4pk. I had to mail the 1 bottle back but quickly got the replacement (this time there was 4) so all was good.I’ve used these in the past, and I think it smells great. I don’t think it’s the best moisturizing product on the market, as I still tend to use lotion after the shower, but it’s great if I’m trying to get ready quickly as I won’t feel dry throughout the day if I’m not able to use a different lotion right after. It still leaves me feeling good and a little can go a long way. I love the smell of typical Olay Shea Butter products. This in-shower lotion is not a scent I enjoy. I only use it at night so the scent doesn’t linger. The product works as expected, leaving skin more moisturized than before. I struggle with putting on any body moisturizer and this easily becomes part of the shower routine. In shower seems to work better for me Wish this was still available for purchase."
299,B001ET734C,"Good for my sensitive skin. Light but moist enough. It is really smooth and pretty good, but it doesn't really help with super dry skin, but still really smooth, and good. Works great & doesn't break the bank. These are top of the line products for a fraction of the cost Good stuff I've been using it for years This is an excellent product. I have been washing my hands a lot more lately due to the virus, and that combined with the colder, dryer, weather have unfortunately resulted in very dry hands. I have tried other Cetaphil products before, and found them to be excellent. I was somewhat cautious to try this one, as I’d tried an off brand version of a similar product from Walgreens and it not only stunk horribly, but didn’t even moisturize my skin! Scented lotions and even Aquafor have also done little to help my hands. This product, however, does an amazing job. I have been using it for the past few week or so and my skin feels so soft and healthy! It doesn’t have much of a smell, which is perfectly fine with me. I would highly recommend! I've had this lotion on my shelf for months and kept using my 'fancier', good smelling stuff. I guess you could say that I am sort of a 'lotion junky' because I have so many. I even have some in a storage room because I don't have enough room on my closet shelves for all of them. I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason. I don't know why because I hadn't even opened my Cetaphil lotion yet. Maybe because it's in such a plain bottle. But, as they say, ""don't judge a book by it's cover"". I now know this applies to my Cetaphil lotion. For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best, but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW!! I don't think my skin has felt this soft in a long time. Well, maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft. This stuff doesn't wear off or evaporate like some others that have to be reapplied a few hours later. My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs, arms, etc. I will now be using this from now on as my first pick. Who knew? Lotion is all in the top of the plastic bag it came in. Creamy goes on easy"
300,B000143O7G,"OVERALL REVIEW:Speaking as a product junkie who prides herself on knowing a good product and being objective, I have to say this is an awesome product.  Yes, it's a bit pricey but the benefits are well worth it. My skin is brighter, smoother and softer. Reduced acne and large pores..............Want or need to know more?  Keep reading :) ...........MY SKIN:I am in my early 40's and have mocha brown skin which tends to get oily in certain areas of my face.  I also suffer from adult acne which can range from a pimple or 2 or 10! These of course, leave some acne scars (due to extraction) but once I have that under control with the use of creams, treatments and use of peels....life is ok!  This past year I began seeing large pores around my cheek area and noticed my face had become uneven in skin tone.  Yikes! *faint*MY(old) REGIMEN:I used at home  salicylic and glycolic (liquid kind) peels every other week.  Exfoliated in between peels and was diligent about keeping my skin and pores clean. However, using these peels I had to wait a week before seeing results and sometimes afraid I would burn my skin, leave on too long or just make my situation worse.  I had anxiety each time I used them, so I was extra careful and received good results.  One day when I went to re-order my peels  I stumbled across ""Instant Peel"".  I figured, what the heck and here we are.HOW I USED THE PRODUCT:The product recommends that you use it in the shower, which I have found is the best method (yeah I tried other non-shower methods like steaming face, warm damp towel on face, etc). There are 6 packets and it is creamy in texture (not thick-creamy a bit liquidy).1. Once in the shower for about 1-2 minutes (your face has to be moist/damp NOT wet), squeeze out a little bit onto the tips  of your fingers.  With your fingers, smooth liquidy cream onto an area of your face; then, using back and forth motion apply light to moderate pressure (don't massage it in using a circular motion-go back and forth). The dead skin will roll off onto your fingers. Just rinse your fingers pat dry with a cloth (hang one over the shower rod where you can get to it easily). I found that doing one side of my face (a cheek and jawline) at the same time works best. I use about 33-40% of the product for each side of my face (twice).  Doing smaller sections works well too but if you have a lot of dead skin then you will spend a little more time in the shower and possibly risk running out of hot water!  :)  Rinse off the product from fingers and splash a little on face to get rid of the residue.2. Repeat process on other side and forehead. I liken this peeling process to having Elmers Glue (white stuff we used in school during art time) being semi-dry on your hands and you roll it off to be free of gluey hands.  You will know when all of the dead skin is off your face because you will not be able to roll anymore off.3. BEWARE!  If you rub too hard and continue to rub vigorously past the ""no more rolling required"" point you will cause your face to be raw and red and even perhaps end up damaging your skin (yes, this is what happened to me! I was overly excited).  Just be sure to stop rubbing when the skin stops rolling off onto your fingers and you'll be fine. The product isn't supposed to affect new skin cells but, again, if you rub like a mad woman (i.e., yours truly) then there is a risk of hurting your skin.  So just don't do it!  :)SIDE NOTE & TIP:Unbeknownst to me, when I first used the product I had so much dead skin on my face it was unreal!  I was sure I would have very little dead skin cell removal because I exfoliated regularly.  Ha!  wrong.  I ended up using a pack and a half of product.  If you have product left over put the unused portion/packet in a ziplock bag and save for next time. Make sure to seal it. This is important because the product will dry out and go bye-bye.THE RESULTS:Once done showering, I dried off, patted face dry and couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the mirror.  My skin was literally and noticeably brighter and more even toned. After one use?? The large pores on my cheeks had reduced in size, acne pimples drastically reduced in size, face looked younger (a solid 5 years-Girl Scouts' Honor!!), skin was radiant looking and felt baby soft smooth. Again, this was after the first use! I stood in literal awe. Amazing!!!!!  I have not used my at home liquid peels since then.  I continued using this product because this one does the trick and you see instant results.  My make-up goes on smoother and people comment on my skin and it's texture. That's a whole new thing for me.  When I first started using the product I used it 2 times the first week (3 packets) and then once every other week (1 packet). The entire box lasted about 2-1/2 months.  I am now on box #2.  The benefits are so great that this is now a part of my (new) face care regimen. So glad I invested in this product and stumbled across the page.  I love the way my skin looks and feels. I haven't seen my skin this ""bright and glowy"" in yearsIn case you are wondering......MY(new)REGIMEN:Use peel once every two weeks (only have to use 1 packet now).  After using the peel,  I use a quality oil control astringent, and a light moisturizer. In between peels, I use a glycolic exfoliating wash every 2-3 days and this along with the Instant Peels have helped keep the dreaded acne at bay. I will also note that I have not had as much dead skin removal since the first time I used it.  My skin continues to look youthful and the acne marks/spots are lighter. My skin tone has evened out quite a bit especially near the jawline.  I love this stuff!  It really is amazing!  Yayyy :) It is expensive for such a tiny little amount per packet, but I don't think there is any other product out there like it.  I use the Baiden mitten for my body, which is also unique to exfoliation in the same way, by rubbing damp skin you start getting the dead top layer to crumb up and roll off. Baiden make a more gentle version specifically for the face, but as many times as I've tried it as gently as possible, I still end up with some spots (like the eye brow where there is no padding under the skin to the bone) sort of abraded.  The face is just too delicate and fraught with difficult nooks and crannies for the Baiden mitten.  The perfect solution is this packet of Earthen Instant Peel - I actually find that I can get about 3 uses from one packet, it takes so little of the mud-like substance to work.  When I first tried it several years ago before I'd heard of Baiden or even knew that dead skin could crumb-up and roll off like this, I was completely skeptical and thought it was just the earthen mud substance itself that was crumbing as you rubbed it and it dried, I really did not believe that it was gathering dead skin cells - I thought it was a total gimmick to fool people.  I tested by going over the same area several times, rinsing and starting with fresh product, and noticed each time it would crumb up less and less until it wouldn't crumb up at all - meaning it had gotten off every last bit of the dead layer of cells.  Even then I wasn't convinced, I still thought possibly it was just your skin oils combining with the mud that made it crumb up and I was just using up the layer of oil (even though I have dry skin, this is what I thought).I put it away for a year still thinking it was not really doing anything, and then I discovered the Baiden mitten and finally learned that dead skin really DOES crumb up and roll off, and eventually it dawned on me that is what the Earthen product was doing - something in their formula manages to do the same thing with a mud-like substance (I can't even guess how). So I came back to try it again and was now firmly convinced it was truly exfoliating - and unlike the Baiden mitten, there are never any spots that are over-abraded, and it's easy to get into the recesses (like between the eye and nose-bridge etc.)  I had actually noticed for a while that inner eye-socket area was flaky and because of that, the cover stick I'd use for my under-eye circles would not go on smoothly, even using extra moisturizer did not fix it.  Well, I was amazed and delighted once I returned to trying this Earthen product the second time around and specifically concentrated on exfoliating that area - the flaking was totally gone and the cover stick went on smoothly on pristine baby-smooth skin - it really and truly worked!I'm unaware of any other product out there like this for the face - any other exfoliation peel is more likely going to be the harsh irritating acidic type that leaves your skin a little raw and sensitive for a few days or similar until the fresh new skin grows in, but the Earthen product does not utilize any kind of irritation or harshness at all, somehow it ONLY removes the dead layer and if you don't have any dead layers left, it simply does nothing - you couldn't get it to take off the live layers even if you wanted to.For anyone who hasn't tried it before, I recommend using this in the shower after your face has been soaking wet for a while, but towel drying it first, it takes about a minute of gentle rubbing before it starts to crumb your dead skin layer off - if you start with too damp skin it will take longer as it has to dry just a bit before it starts working. I've been using Earthen since 2015. It still works, but they have drastically cut it with water or something to make it really liquidy. It used to have a much thicker consistency, almost like greek yogurt, which made it really easy to work with on your fingers or in the shower. Now, a bunch of it gets wasted just trying to dispense it no matter how much you mix the packet because it has the consistency of half & half. It still removes skin like nothing else I've ever used, but I feel for the cost, which has always been questionably high is even worse. This is an update to a review I already wrote after using the product once. The first time, I must have done something wrong. It did nothing,  but make my skin feel moisturized. I decided to try it again today and a big difference. I didn’t do it in the shower like the first time. Just wet my face a little. Applied the product and let it sit a minute. Started rubbing my face and all the dead skin started to roll off. It made my face feel silky smooth.I’ll definitely keep using it now that I know how to use it. Don’t use it in the shower. Too much water. It just runs off your face."

302,B000JG1QDA,"Love dermalogica! Have used it for years. Always get complements on my skin. Non-irritating. This is a good skin cleanser. My face always feels so clean when i use this cleanser. It has been good with keeping my skin from breaking out. I am seeming to get skin breakouts so to wearing a mask. I’m not sure why but this product certainly helps keep me clear. I liked this cleansing gel. It works just like it says it would.  It makes my skin feel really soft and clean. I love all Dermalogica products, and this one is no exception. My skin feels so clean and soft after using this cleansing gel. It cleans my skin deep down into the pores and leaves my skin feels very soft. Highly recommend it. Dermalogica, has been the skin care product I have used for over 10 years. Always happy with the results I get. Very satisfied I love that this face wash is gentle yet effective, the scent isn’t overwhelming and I plan on using as long as they make it. Fan for life. I noticed this cleanser drys my skin and makes forehead itchy.  It does have nice fragrance and nice consistency.  I won't repurchase due to this and also $39 is a lot for full size I just can't afford with this economy as $39 is groceries or gas for my family.  I ended up ordering Neutrogena as it was under $10 and more affordable for me.  You can get Neutrogena glycerin bar for $2.50 that one works good too."
303,B00014JKG0,"I received this only 4 days after ordering it!  I took away one star, because it's not quite as brown as I expected from the other reviews.  Most people said that it's not orangey at all, and I found that it did have a slight orangey color to it.  Not bad at all though, just not as good as some spray tans I've had.  There definitely is NOT the weird chemical smell.  Apparently it's also paraben free which is great, and VEGAN, for folks like me.  Better ingredients, better product.I have an in-between skin color.  I'm not fair, or olive... I can get pretty tan, but I do freckle a little bit, and get pale in the winter.  I didn't want to waste money on the Light tones, so I went for the medium.  It's November, and I'm definitely NOT tan right now.  I used this stuff last night before bed (which you really aren't supposed to do, because it might rub off on your sheets), but I was excited, and went ahead.  I can tell a pretty significant difference this morning.  I left it a little too concentrated on my for-arms, and have a line that looks kind of orangish.  My legs and everything have a nice glow to them though.  Because I'm so pale right now, I probably should have gone with the one for light tones, and I doubt I would see this orange tone.My advice, if you're like me, not olive- not fair, a little freckly, and very pale from lack of sun, you may want to get the light tone.  Especially if you have some important even coming up that you want to look really natural for (like wedding pictures or something).  If you just want to reduce that winter pastiness, then by all means, this is a very delightful product.  It's moisturizing, and smells good.  I don't know if it would work on the face well.  I wish someone that had tried would post.  I had some self-tanner for the face by Jergens, so I used it.  It stinks :(, but I didn't want to wake up like an oompa loompa.  Good product, give it a shot, just for the shear stink-lessness. Let me just preface this product review by saying...I have been using Jergens Natural Glow for over 5 years ...(the Medium tone which is a perfect shade for me). Now, this product is NOTHING like the Jergen's product... This one is more CONCENTRATED. I can apply a thin amount on my arm, and minutes later, I'm looking at an arm that would have taken me 3 THICKER applications of the Jergen's...(it's a given, that we are all have different skin types and tones, so what I describe is my own experience and others may have a different outcome or may think I'm exaggerating in some way.) I am very naturally pale, white skinned, so in my mind, using a self tanner, helps me look more 'alive', and less, drab. LOLOkay, so I have found myself having embarrassing conversations with various people in my life. All because I am not use to this product, and/or think it's similar to the Jergen's product...I'm just writing this to detail some of my experiences, that were somewhat embarrassing....#1: At work: I've ONLY had to explain, after doing a ""RUSHED"" application of the lotion, on my way to work & fresh out of the shower (I'm not 100% dry, because I'm in a hurry)... I end up with streaks that I can't see sometimes, like on the back of my arms.I found out, when I heard some whispering from co-workers...and then one of the ladies, taps me on the shoulder and says ""What is that? Are you okay?"" They thought I had some sort of skin disorder...#2: I'm with family members, I relax, with shorts on, and lay on my side... After two minutes mom says ""What are you doing to yourself?""...before I can answer, she's touching my lower ankle, ... caught off-guard, I stumble to answer, it took a while before I figured out it was my self tanner,and not my boyfriend abusing me (And no, he doesn't, LOL) (awkward conversation.)#3: I get my blood work drawn regularly for medical purposes. The phlebotomist preps my skin before drawing blood with an alcoholic swab...and the poor old lady gasps after rubbing my veins and looks at the brown color. (uncomfortably awkward).#4: It's freezing temperatures overnight...(not too common here in Houston)...So, I procrastinate in washing makeup off my face because it's ice cold water, ...I pass time by reading perfume bottles on the counter, and occasionally running my wrists into the tap water...by the time I look back at the water in the sink, I panic!!! OMG the PIPES must have burst with the freezing weather...All I saw was dark rust colored water! I woke up family members, saying Our Water is coming out BROWN!! Took 3 minutes before I figured out, ...Well, here goes another fine moment, when I must explain, Nope, it's just this NEW Tan lotion I'm using, and not use to...No, it's not our pipes bursting because of the below freezing temperatures outside, yup, awkward... Sorry, go back to bed everybody! LOLThere is a few other conversations I've had with a significant other, but I'll spare the readers the details. LOL. You get the picture...just be extra sure to be dry, and if using on your face, you have to do some EXTRA exfoliating, as it tends to roll right off my face if I don't exfoliate first...Despite the embarrassments and explanations, yes, I will purchase this product again, and yes I recommend it, I just need try the lighter shade next time. :P I like this self-tanner more than any of the other ones I've tried.For a while I was using lotion with a little self-tanner in it, and that did the job but wasn't great, I wanted a little more color for the summer. I tried this based on the good reviews, and I'm glad I did.Now, this is a self-tanner, not a lotion with a little tanner in it, so it will leave you streaky and splotchy if you don't use it right (exfoliate, put it on evenly, let it dry).  But after nearly a week, I'm very happy with the results. The first day was a little rough; I didn't exfoliate well enough, and I had some streaks.  The second day I scrubbed really well with the bath pouf in the shower, and that seems to have fixed the problem.  A little goes a long way, and while this bottle will definitely not last a year, I could see it lasting at least a month or two with daily use, which is more than most self-tanners.  And for being relatively un-chemical-y, it's a good price.I love the texture; it's a nice, thick lotion that actually moisturizes too, which is great.  The smell is really nice, too; I don't smell it every time, but I get whiffs of almost a baby oil type smell.  It's very light, and not even a little overpowering.  The tan seems to have built over a few days, and I'll likely start alternating between this and my regular lotion pretty soon.Overall, I can definitely see myself continuing to use this lotion long-term.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is I wish it wasn't in a pump bottle; I can never get all the product out of those."
304,B00014HF94,"According to my order history, I have bought this 12 times since 2017, back when it was under $9.50 a bottle. Which sounds about right, because I don't worship this liquid gold... I bathe in it.It is THICK, it sinks in rather slowly on its own (I see this as a plus), it has no discernable scent and I have never experienced a quality control issue.I'm West Indian. I have great hair, but... I also have stretch marks, hyperpigmentation scars from MRSA, acne (in my 30s!!) related to PCOS, super chronic dehydration/papery skin from medications and flares in autoimmune responses. Fun!I put this either dispensed into portable oil pens for my nails, thinned with sesame carrier oil on airless pumps for my fingertips after I embroider/sew or directly from the bottle for a little dab'll do ya---depending on what I'm using it for.When I use it on my nails/hands before bed on a consistent basis, my nails can/have grown up to an inch long (glorrrrrrious) while remaining flexible enough to not crack or peel at the base of my nailbeds from trauma. My ~beauty routines~ are non-existent, so if I fall off the horse for 7-10 days, my nails break (always straight across??) from my klutzy smashing self. (Moment of silence.)If I use it on the ""lupus butterfly"" flare rashes under my eyebrows/upper cheeks, they sometimes cease to advance and connect across my nose or blister/flake.If I use it on places I have picked my skin to the point of blood, the scab falls off (naturally) much faster and I am left with a fainter melanin spot than I would normally have to wait on to fade. If I use it in my MRSA scars, they are not as bad after sun exposure and become less visible. (I never stick with this longterm to reduce them though, because I'm a slacker.) I do not use it daily on my face though, so no idea about poor clogging.If I use it on my knees or elbows, I lose that ""ashy"" darkened skin POC get.And on. And on. And on.I DO wish it came safety sealed, but other than that ...flawless.I have never had a bottle break, the cap is a nice weighty material and it never leaks when I set them upsidedown to get the last product out.14/10 recommend to everyone. Holy grail. This is a pure Vitamin E without additives. I have multiple allergies and very sensitive skin. I have used Vitamin E oil in the past but started to get irritated skin from it. I recently purchased this product and it has not been a problem for me. I added it to the apricot oil I use on my face and it has really soothed the irritation from using masks at work. The texture of this is thick & the quality seems excellent. Apply gently so that it thins out as it warms on your skin. The package is beautiful & tiny as expected. Lovely for massaging into my thyroid scar. Breathe & heal & love yourself! It feels very nice, much better than the drug store synthetic kind :) no slight irritation - none at all with this. Six months post-op, people are shocked to see how my scar is just disappearing. I notice it constantly of course. Massage for scar tissue is a big part of this, and this oil helps it not feel so dry & tight which is wonderful in my heart-opening yoga poses. I also use rosehip, raspberry & jojoba oils. <3 Stop searching for vitamin E oil if you are looking for the real deal. This is IT. It's thick and it goes a long way I use this in all my homemade lotions and oils and straight out of the bottle for an extra ""remove that wrinkle by morning"" type situation. I applied this to a crack I got on the corner of my lip the other day and it's healed now. Literally healed in two days. I have bought this product twice and the last time was in 2013. I seem to buy this once every other year so, again, it may seem like .5 an ounce is nothing but this stuff lasts like the Lady who would never run out of mill.. As many have mentioned already it is D ALPHA TOCOPHERYL (pure unlike the synthetic version which is DL TOCOPHERYL). It is not however the ACETATE version but that's OK because I plan to use it well before its shelf life. It is thick and of a yellowish color as it has been described. In fact, thick enough where the lid may stick a bit but I'll just wash the lid with warm water if need be. I had a good feeling about it when I purchased it because of the useful descriptions posted here. I have used the so-called pure versions but they ended up being synthetic because they had a clear color and had a scent. Not like others, It dose not drip ( meaning thicker than others) which I appreciate for using around my eye &! I believe the ingredient is good because It does not give me itchiness for my very sensitive skin: The only thing is that the price is much higher than where I purchased before. Seems kinda tacky and thick, does absorb after a short time This stuff works! It is not as dark as the one in the photograph but it is not clear white like some vitamin E oils are, It is lighter in color and it is thick. It did heal my skin and make it soft and silky smooth. It is very sticky though and kinda hard to get off the hands when rubbing. I will be ordering it again when I need some more. I do wish it came with a dropper though, it is not easy to pour a drop at a time being so thick."
305,B00023DIBI,"I love this stuff so much I went to trouble of putting 2 soap dispenser's over my sink in the kitchen. 1 for dish soap Thought I’d try this product and to my surprise it’s the best product out there. The smell is fresh, your hands feel moisturized, and after use your sink and bathroom smell fresh as well. This product is right up there with poopouri, except you get more benefits with this soap. Also, goes through soap pump easily, one pump goes along ways and lathers up exceptionally well! I like and border on love for this product! Oh the smell! 👃👃👃yummy! I have been using thus product for years. Its a quality soap with a refreshing fragrance. I have been using this product for years. I love it. Very good experience with seller. My wife is obsessed with this soap. Has a pleasant scent and cleans well. It's pricy though.Bottle arrived cracked and was leaking. Very poor packaging. Amazon gave me refund. Always consistently best value Love the feel and smell - not sticky/tacky or watery either."
306,B00027DMJW,"Like that it's not a pump tube, tube is what I'm accustomed to, after using for decades. I use it every summer and I'm 50 years old. It's maybe one of the best cream to apply under a liquid foundation or a bb cream. Even when I don't wear make-up, I apply it in the morning and don't use sunscreen unless I go outside for many hours. It doesn't give a firmness to your skin, it just prevent new wrinkles to form. I use another cream at night that is for firmness. Creams are just to avoid the worst, not to do miracle.The only thing I would say is that a retinol creams, it includes Roc Retinol Correcxion Deep Wrinkle, aren't made to use on an irritated skin. After a face scrub, a sunburn or if you have redness on your nose or cheeks, you might want to avoid using it. It doesn't help. I recommend it for a day cream, that you wear make up or not. It's a good anti-wrinkles, it will protect you from the sun (which is the most damageable for your skin) and will be a perfect base if you apply make up. Not recommended for reactive or very sensitive skin. This is moisturizing, inexpensive and does a great job of keeping fine wrinkles at bay without the drying effects of full-blown tretinoin. Recommend. It will took my skin about a week to get used to it..if you use regular application initially it will dry your skin too much, so be patient. Such a small amount does the trick. I've been using it for about a month now and I can see a difference in my wrinkles. I like the texture leaves my skin smooth After I opened the box, there was moisturizing fluid on the outside of the tube. Then I noticed it was leaking from the bottom of the tube. I haven’t opened the top yet to see if it is okay to use. I hate to admit it, but I'm getting older and I used to use this cream when I was younger and it worked. But then again, I had less problem areas to work on. I just started using it again and it's good. It won't make you younger but your skin actually feels better and small lines seem to disappear. It's not good to check out the results in a super 10 times magnifying mirror, as I do because that's just going to depress you and you'll find 10 other imperfections that you can't do anything about unless you marry a rich man with bad vision or date a plastic surgeon looking for a new project. 5 stars for the fact that this cream really gives my skin a lift!"
307,B000I4AMDS,"Read a scientific review on the efficacy of various skin care products.  This product has nearly all the effective ones.  Its like they read the same review.  I use it after a day in the sun to reverse sun damage.  Then I use my sunscreen the next morning, and do it all over again. The consistency has changed for the worst I bought this product because the same company makes an ointment that I absolutely adore. This serum is good, it's lightweight, moderately moisturizing, and it does feel like it does ""something"" I just can't put my finger on exactly what. It's pretty inexpensive, doesn't smell terrible, and is natural - all in all, I'm pretty sure I'll buy it again. I love this and will buy again.. This is an okay product, nothing to throw a party for. I don't feel that ""soak into your skin"" feeling that you get when you apply a serum to your freshly washed face. Could be that it's the dead of winter and I need more than just a serum to feel like my skin is especially hydrated. I mix a few drops of rosehip oil. For now I will use it because I spent the money on it but probably not re-invest in this once I run out. I rarely write reviews- but this product is truly a stand-out. Best serum for the price i've ever used and I have used all the expensive stuff. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily and this never aggravates it. If i have a dry skin (and i mean burning dry skin) , after using this 2 days it is completely back to normal. Evens skin tone. Makes skin glow. Incredible ingredients for anti-aging and amazing price. Highly recommend. Amazing beauty secret. Everyone I've gifted this too feels the same way and raves about it. I have really enjoyed using this, my doctor suggested it and it worked well for me with my rosacea. It doesn't cure it, but it doesn't hurt and still moisturizes the face. I have oily skin, but this stuff moisturizes without feeling greasy or sticky. It's lightweight, effective with no parabens and only natural fragrance (which is quite nice). I'm sensitive to a lot of products and smells and this one is a big winner. I'm on my second bottle - and this price on Amazon is even less than I was getting on iHerb. I also have the gentle foaming cleanser by nutribiotic and it's great."
308,B0006BDMIU,"I love this product so much, but im looking for cheaper options I use a lot of face mists but this one has been my number one through the years. The scent is very refreshing and it gives a glow to the skin. I try to keep my skin routine straight forward and simple. However, I've always been interested in this elixir spray. It's always been on the higher end price wise but when I saw it was finally on sale I went for it. No regrets. It's a treat for my skin. It gives an extra layer of moisture, smells good and I even get compliments on how my skin seems to glow. The only thing to know is you do need to give it a little shake as oils naturally separate. I couldn't find this product at Sephora anymore and I really love it. It's a refreshing, cool mist I spray on my face in the morning and the evening. It especially is nice in the summer months. The amount of product in the glass bottle is a good value for the money. I am currently in nursing school so I’m VERY stressed out and it’s been most noticeable on my lower face (pics 1 and 2). I’ve been using this product for only 5 days now and it has made a world of a difference (pic 3). Honestly after only one day I saw a difference, I just didn’t remember to take a picture. I am beyond happy that I saw this product recommended on Tik Tok, and I can say without a doubt that it is worth the price! It is a little drying but that’s expected and it says on the bottle to use moisturizer afterwards as well. 10/10 recommend! :) At first I wasn’t sure I would like this, although within a week I could tell a difference. It has a nice scent.  I will not want to go without it in the future I gave this product 4 stars because firstly, it didn't come sealed, and secondly, the solution doesn't look uniform. Otherwise, it's been a pleasant little spray i like to use in the morning to awaken my skin and feel more hydrated. Non irritating, has a natural scent that is neither really good nor pungent. Its a smell I'd expect for the ingredient in this product. I'd buy again. I bought the sample size LOVE IT! So bought the bigger one. So yes same ingredients but somehow different !?!?  Smells great and this bottle I have to shake soooooomxuh so separate the oils because otherwise the LEMONBALM oils are floating on the top and too strip g on skin burns .  Love the product however but I feel maybe the smaller size perhaps didn’t have much of the oil …?  I use it for body spray now since too strong for face."
309,B000VFUS0Q,"This was very heavy and sticky. It didn't feel like it moisturized for long even though it claimed it would for 12 hours. Felt like putting normal lotion on my face. Pricey but worth it. Good product. Skin feels great after application. It feels dry when I put it on but I think it does Moisturizers I have used this product for many years and most recently thru Amazon due to the death of my MK representative ~ I have noticed quite a big indentation in my creams until now ~ this jar was full!! I highly recommend this product and provider and will most definitely continue to purchase my MK thru this Provider. How did I not know about this moisturizer before? I recently found this moisturizer to ring a photo shoot. The hair and make up artist was using it. It feels so good and smooth and hydrating that I just had to ask her where she got it from and luckily I found it in Amazon. The moisturizer has some kind of shine/shimmer to it. When you put makeup on top of it your makeup really looks smooth And healthy. I have dry skin, and I think that this product really helps keep my face moisturized all day. I use a green tea based toner under the moisturizer. I think they work great together. Not cheap but it’s a best to use product This product is ridiculously thick!  Way too much drag on the face when you are applying! I have to put coconut oil on first just to make it spreadable!  Not a fan!!’"
310,B001FYZLPE,"After years of struggling with a skin bacteria infection (which I didn't even know I had until this month), Defense is whipping this infection out. The gunk surrounding all the hair follicles on my head and the bleeding rash on my chest and stomach are being resolved — and I've only used the product for 5 days! My son has used this product for some time and told me about it. I used it to treat a scalp condition and it worked great This soap is the best stuff out there for limiting skin disorders like ring worm, impetigo, etc.  Always worth the purchase when it comes to protecting the skin.  My son has used this product for years during wrestling seasons and has not had any of these skin disorders.  Five star product! I beleive this soap to be the best soap I have ever used for keeping the skin healthy. I am a person that is not big on herbs and oils and all that. I bought this product based mainly on the reviews that I had read.  It has two types of oils in it. Teetree oil and ecuplyptas oil. During the past year I have had issues with fungas. Mainly due to sweating. If you ever get one of these fungas growing on your body you will find that they dont go away easily. I tried alot of different brands of antifungal creme and sprays. The cremes seemed to work the best but they take alot of time. When i tried this product out I  was surprised to see how fast this stuff works. I had a little area about 1 inch in diameter and it was burning from the sweat. This stuff soothes the area and healed that same area in less then a day. IF you read the website on defense soap.com you will see that its made for atheletes. Mainly wrestlers and others that have bodily contact with dunge and such. Its not approved by the FDA so they cant say that it kills fungas but in a test they did with 8 pertr dishes of fungas it killed them all. The secret to this type of soap is that it doesnt kill the natural bacteria on your skin like alchohal would. This product encourages the natural bacteria to stay. For that reason your not likely to get recurrant infections or such so frequently. Another thing on this liquid soap is that its concentrated. Not diluted like alot of those bodywash type soaps are. It takes just a little bit to lather up. To me the oil smells strange but it seems to wash off when you rinse. I dont think that others would really notice the aroma from this soap.One thing that they would notice is if you have a fungas eating away on your skin!  It seems as we get older the body has a harder time in combacting skin bacteria. For me this product is the best I have ever used. The only thing I could say to myself about this product was ""Wow""!  ""It really works""! Bought this after trying the bar soap. This one is very condensed and goes a long way. I had prostate cancer and surgery to remove the prostate. Later had to have radiation. This leaves you with incontinence issues and I have to wear a heavy pad. It's hard to stay clean wearing those. I got a boil the size of a quarter and 3/4"" deep in my pubic area and had to stay in hospital a week so they could give antibiotics via IV. The boil was caused from Staph and I kept getting smaller ones about every week or two. Very annoying and concerning plus worrying about spreading to others in household. Best advise Doctors had was to alcohol on them and bleaching clothing. Nothing seemed to help so I stumbled on the defense products. It wasn't instant, but this shower gel seems to have stopped the problem. Time will tell. Staph is very had to get rid of once it's gotten a foot hold and having to wear a pad makes it even harder to get rid of. This is the only product I have found that seems to have worked. Doctors don't even seem to have any good advise other than OTC antibiotics, alcohol and bleach.Update: 5-21-14 Lowering my rating from 5 to 4 stars and that's being generous. It's been several months since my original review. I'm not as impressed as I was. I'm still getting boils every 3 weeks or so which not much better than before I started using this product. Not sure if it helps or the staph got a little better on it's own. I quit using it about 3 weeks ago as a test and see no increase in getting boils. I believe this product is more intended to prevent staph if you go to a gym where it is known to spread. I still have another full bottle so I will continue experiment with it until it's used up. I read the reviews and decided to try this for my dry itchy skin.  I live in a hot humid sub-tropical environment and have been itching like crazy for a month.  I took a shower with this and the itch has stopped.  The redness is gone also.I perspire a lot here since the humidity stays over 60% year round, and that leads to itching sometimes for most people here.  I don't know what it is but it might be skin yeast.  This totally relieves it.I had my doubts this would work but it does.  It also lathers, which surprises me considering the listed ingredients:saponified oils of coconut and olive, jojoba oil, vegetable gum/glycerin extract, Aloe vera, tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil.  I see nothing here that would cause this to lather.  I am guessing a few ingredients are not listed.  This should smell heavenly but it has a faint stink to it.It smells like a stinky version of eucalyptus oil.  I use eucalyptus oil in everything and use it also in my bath water and in my oil burners to fragrance the house.  This reeks compared to real eucalyptus, unless it is terribly rancid, but I'm not sure that's it since I've never smelled rancid eucalyptus.  It reminds me a little of gasoline smell.I tried this on the back of  my scalp and it is very sticky and makes my hair feel like it has gunk in it. But it did help my itchy scalp. Not good for the hair though at all.Anyway, if you have itchy skin that nothing helps, give this a try.  I recommend it highly for that."
311,B000IOFQWK,"The reason I did not give it 5 stars, is because it does have a bit of a smell and I have to reapply a lot more to keep my tan on... Nothing horrible, however when I see a 5 star rating, I think ""perfect"", without any defects. I have used more expensive tanning products that are not as great as this. As a matter of fact, I haven't found one that is better than this, (yet). I'm sure there is a better product though. But as long as this stuff is being sold at this price, I will continue to use faithfully without shopping around. I'm very pale, (if I red hair I would be a ginger) lol. I have freckles, blue eyes, the whole pale girl package! The only thing I do not have is light colored hair. I have dark hair, so I really need some color on me! I have pretty much made a career out of trying tanning products. Very few can I actually use without being turned orange. This does not turn me orange. It is a subtle, yet darkish, nice brown color. Also another product I like is a cheapy sold at Walmart. It's a hemp glow lotion. (Takes a week for the full color). I like to mix the two together and use them. I actually mix them with even amounts and apply. I have used the sun labs alone, its just because im so pale, if I use it alone in one step, I'm like 20x darker in a few minutes, vs mixing it with other moisturizers and taking a few days to a week to get full color. I just don't like stepping out and people immediately knowing im fake LOL. Not to mention, I make less mistakes if I do just a tad of color at a time. Gives you room to play with, and every day you can correct small mistakes from the day before, as you slowly get darker.  Just my 2 cents on this product anyway :)Tips : Mix this with moisturizer (equal parts), or another glow lotion.Make a habit of shaving daily, exfoliating, and moisturizing. I know this sounds like a lot of work, and it is! But, when you use self tanners, you have to take the extra time to take care of and prep your skin so that it looks great. 9 times out of ten, errors from self tanners are made just from not having properly hydrated and smooth skin. When you have dry patches, it causes the lotion to absorb at different rates and such which therefore causes uneven color.  Not much you can do about streaks, unless you tan slowly (by mixing, or using a daily glow lotion which takes several days). With those, you can easily correct small mistakes the day after and its very unlikely that you'll miss the same areas several days in a row. I have never had a streak after a few days of tanning slower, vs using a full strength tanner in one sitting.  The worst thing that has happened to me in trying tanning products, is that I have ended up orange, but at least my tan was even and smooth! LOL! Nothings worse than orange, AND streaky.I suggest trying this anyway. I used the medium shade. It is dark enough for me because im so pale. Another mistake people make is using one that is too dark for them. Anytime I go even a tad to dark for my skin tone, I end up a rusty color :( Just another thing to keep in mind.  Enjoy! I like to use this on my legs when I'm going out for a big night and I'm wearing shorts or a skirt. It gives me extra confidence, like wearing make up on my face. I shave my legs first, then exfoliate, then apply. I think it goes on really quickly and dries quickly as well. It dries well I'm doing the rest of my getting ready. It doesn't have a scent. I won’t bother repeating what most of the positive reviews already say-  great color, easy to apply, natural not orange color etc. What I will say is that yes, the bronzer does rinse off -  I tan in the evenings, and in the morning the bronze color guide rinses away…it’s supposed to. That’s not your tan you see going down the drain…it’s the color guide. The tan color/stain will be left behind.  And mostly-  use two mitts (or gloves), and IF YOU USE MITTS, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE ONES WITH THUMBS!  Seriously. It makes a HUGE difference in application because you have more control than the ones withOUT the thumbs.  I’ve been using sunless tanners for nearly 30 years (YES, they’ve been around that long!) and they have come a really long way over the years.  This is one of the better ones in my opinion- as someone with fair skin…skin that is ultra sensitive and breakout prone. I’ve never had an issue with this brand.Side note*. Since I tan at night, there is usually some pinkish tan color on my light colored sheets, but it’s never stained my sheets… it washes right out, even in cold water.  👍🏻👍🏻 I've used quite a few self tanners in the past few years because it's really the only way I can tan with my weird skin (super pale yet also Mediterranean, so I have to basically lay in direct sunlight for hours before I even start to tan) - this is my new go-to.I decided to order this because I found a list of the best sunless tanners for 2014, and this one was the only reasonably priced and widely available option near the top. I got this as an add-on item, so I was really happy with the price.The pump is totally useless. I don't know if my bottle became pressurized during shipping or what. It comes with the pump locked down - I gave it a slight half-twist to unlock it, and the pump head shot off like a rocket, ricocheted off the ceiling, and landed in my toilet. I washed it off and tried to snap it back down, but it wasn't happening. On top of that, I noticed that the lotion was being pulled out onto the sides of the pump stem when I moved it up and down (very messy), so I gave up, locked the pump back down, and just unscrewed the top and poured.I was pretty skeptical at first because this stuff is VERY dark right out of the bottle - it looks like chocolate syrup. But it rubs in really evenly, absorbs quickly, and actually smells really pleasant (kind of fruity). That was all a major relief because I've definitely used a few self tanners that just kind of sit on top of your skin for hours, smelling like death the whole time.It does start to stain your hands very quickly - I did one leg, scrubbed my hands with soap and water, then did the other leg, scrubbed my hands with soap and water, and so on. I'd definitely recommend either wearing gloves or doing one area at a time and scrubbing off in between. I didn't end up with any hand stains the next day.The color went through a few stages for me. (Again, might just be my weird skin.) When I first rubbed it in, it was invisible. After about 15 minutes it started to turn a pinky-orange color, and I was like, ""Oh-god-what-have-I-done?"" I *almost* washed it off, but instead I just decided to see what would happen and went to bed. I slept for about seven hours, and when I woke up in the morning, it was back to looking invisible. I showered but didn't exfoliate, and went to work. When I got home nine hours later, I inspected again, and it had turned into a pretty natural-looking, even tan.It's a little more orange than a natural tan would be on me, but only a little. I was surprised at how even and noticeable-yet-subtle it ended up being since it was so dark right out of the bottle. I'm sure you can build it up to be darker with a few more days of application, but one was enough for me. Overall I'm really happy with it (though I will probably transfer it to a bottle with a better pump), and I'll buy this again when I run out. I had trepidations that a self tanner would look unnatural, but I was happy to see that a dab of this product provides a natural-looking glow that's not too dark. I have purchased this product multiple times now.  This is the best self tanning lotion that I have ever used. I have olive skin, and this did not create much of a ""tan"". I was disappointed."
312,B000W0HA7Y,"I mixed this mango butter into my homemade leave-in hair conditioner and used it after my co-wash. I also use other essential oils plus shea butter. I was concerned my final recipe would be little heavy, but my hair loves it and it turned out soft and very moisturized. The final result whipped into a light soufflé. I like variety in my homemade recipes and this mango butter will definitely be a staple in my natural hair care routine and maintenance.The ingredients for my homemade recipe: Shea butter, mango butter, olive oil, jojoba oil, grapeseed oil, castor oil, vitamin E oil, jasmine oil for fragrance. (I melt the butters first by putting them in a small bowl and sitting the smaller bowl in a larger shallow bowl of hot water). I whip all the ingredients together with a hand blender. I place the final whip into a clean plastic BPA free bowl with a lid and will place it in the freezer for 15 minutes to set. Thereafter, I place the leave-in conditioner back in the frig until I'm ready to use it.The amounts of butter and oils can be tweaked depending on your hair needs and amount of conditioner you want to make at one time. I tend to make enough to last no more than 2 weeks and I keep all my finished homemade products stored either in the refrigerator or a cool place like my linen closet. I've never had a batch go bad, but I tend to make only enough to last for 1-2 weeks. I also use this as a general skin balm conditioner as well. It smells really nice! That's the only reason why I chose mango over shea butter. It smells better! The only thing I dislike about it was the packaging. Although gorgeous, the packaging is not the best way to storage the butter. The sealing broke after a few days and because the mango butter melted a little bit, it is too ""slippery"" for the sealimg to hold in place. Also, digging in there to get a hold on to the butter was really messy. I love the product but absolutely hate the packaging. I will reorder if I can find it in a jar or container only. Comes in a bag with it's pieces chunky. It is a hard butter that can be used in bar form or melted down for use in other products. Packaging isn't worth bragging about as mine came in a ziplock style bag with a small tag labeling what the product is. Had I not already bought mango butter in the past I wouldn't know what to expect in terms of scent and texture of the butter. This seller doesn't have any information about their product regarding use, shelf life, or storage.For those who don't know mango butter is a cosmetic product, do not try to use it as a foods item as it isn't made for such uses. This butter can take a bit of time to melt down using the double broiler method. It also takes some time to solidify if left to cool at room temperature. I use mango butter to whip into body/hair butters. I noted that by adding heat to the product and waiting on it to set before whipping takes a while so I just toss everything into a bowl and just whip from there. It does take some time to whip mango butter using a hand blender but it can be done with patience. Time span to whip with other butters and oils is much shorter with out the melting and stepping process. Overall it's a decent buy but packaging really prevents me from wanting to repurchase from this seller again. really good I couldn't wait to try this mango butter when I got it. I used this and Shea butter along with other oils and made some lotion bars. This product is fantastic and can't say enough about the texture of this butter. If the price stays around where it is, I will be buying more soon. This is the best mango that I have ever purchased. Great stuff. Oh and by the way. I didn't get a discount or anything free. I paid full price!After reading some reviews, I'm editing to add that that mine came in a thick container with a screw down lid to seal in freshness. Mine also has a professional label with specification data of the butter along with a fatty acids chart. It also states what the advantages of using this butter and the benifits it provides. Ask before you buy what it's shipped in. I don't think I can tell anyone who I bought from. I love this product. It does come in different packaging from time to time. Sometimes it is in a tub and sometimes a plastic bag. I have purchased this a few times. I will say that I use it for a recipe that calls for 8 ounces... so each package gives me 2 batches of what I make. This last time, the 2nd batch was 13 grams under the 16 ounces for the container. This might not seem like a big deal, but when I need it to measure exactly 8 ounces' worth for each batch, I need it to be exact. I hope this was an error one time. I will still buy it again. No scent but great add for homemade soa ps. Also price wasn't too bad since you get so much and use so little in the soap making mixture. I did not eat nor did I use this product for cooking so I can't give an opinion about it. I’m writing because I’ve been ordering this same product for a year and the last 2, I received refined mango butter but needed to use it due to a deadline, then ordered again, and that order was fine same color, consistency and all as every other I had before. But now this one, I received today 4/27 and it’s jn the raw mango butter packaging Tupperware, but it looks oddly familiar to the refined mango butter, in color and all. I do not want to open it again like the last time I had to, money is very tight right now. Has the recipe changed? Did I receive the wrong item? And again I’m in a time bind deadline for Wednesday 😮 please let me know asap"
313,B000WUCJNY,"This castile soap by Dr. Woods is excellent. I have been using castile soap for over ten years, and Dr Woods is always the brand that I use. If you like Dr Bonner's castile soap, then you will definitely love the Dr Woods brand soap. I have tried nearly every version of the castile soap that Dr Woods produces, and they are all equally great.Furthermore, the price difference between Dr Woods soap, and any of their other competitors, is very significant. Every year I purchase at least several gallons worth of the Dr Woods 32 ounce castile soap bottles. Probably around four or five gallons worth, each year.This soap is very gentle, yet very cleansing -- and completely natural. And each of the different versions of their castile soap smell excellent on top of that. I frequently smell them in my hand, before I add water, because I love how they smell -- it's like aromatherapy. And I use their shea butter castile soap as my shampoo. I recommend all of their different versions, including their black soap, which I frequently use as shampoo for my hair.One thing to keep in mind, is that the shea butter versions of their soap, does not smell quite as strong as their non-shea buttter versions do. That's probably due to the extra shea butter ingredient included in the shea butter soap. If you want the strongest smelling version of their soaps, stick with the non-shea butter versions. But either way, ALL of their castile soaps smell great.Furthermore, this soap is produced right here in the USA, and Dr Woods is a family owned company that produces it, so I enjoy giving my business to great hardworking American family owned companies.If you're looking for great castile soap that smells great, and leaves your skin feeling moisturized, and you want to obtain it at the best and fairest possible price, then you definitely would do well to begin using the Dr. Woods brand castile soap. It was hard to find hand soap in stores, so I decided to try Dr. Woods soap. I was hoping for a good soap I could use to refill all my hand soap pumps with that would also smell nice and help keep the Corona-induced anxiety at bay, and this stuff WORKS! Not only does it work very well as a hand soap (doesn't dry out my skin or leave a weird film), its scent is glorious. If you have to wash your hands more often than you're used to, get a soap that you adore the smell of! I smile every time I use it! Highly recommended! First let me start with my ""I'm not a paid reviewer by any manufacturer or Amazon.. anything I review it's because I've paid for it myself & it's my own personally experience. I do A LOT of amazon shopping, & my reason for picking certain things are always due to helpful reviews so even though this is time consuming, I want to do the same for others.I can't say that I love this stuff but I also can't say a whole lot bad either my biggest complaint is that this does not lather at all or eight require so much just to form a foam on your shower puff Did you know... Soap and Detergent are not the same thing??Both reduce surface tensions of water, but soaps are softer and less harsh on the skin than detergents. Soaps are also biodegradable and do not emit pollutants into rivers, streams and the air. Detergents, in contrast, contain synthetic materials that take much longer to dissolve and degrade. One advantage of detergents is that they are much more powerful than soaps, and it takes a small quantity to wash large volumes of clothing. (reference.com)Purchased this as an 'emulsifier' to use with Neem oil (trying to go 'green' in spraying for insects). Since such a small amount is used for this purpose, decided to use it for personal cleansing and just love it! No residue on skin and smells wonderful! Yes!  Very nicely scented. Helps with eczema and keeps it at bay. Scent is nice but light. Skin feels moisturized after showering. Also great as hand wash liquid. I love their stuff! Especially gonna to tell them this when I go to their restaurant SYLVIA’S in New York again! Soul food here I come! Scent is gorgeous, not too foamy, feel very clean after, but does leave skin feeling a bit tight While I don't like the smell so much the actual soap is amazing on my skin.Before I was using mainstream brands  before I decided to go more natural in health and beauty  and the soaps were stripping the moisture in my skin and hair even the ones that claim to have deep moisture,but not this one I use it one my body and hair and I put some in a old bottle I washed out from my other face wash and used the soap to wash my face every night it removes my makeup without stripping moisture then I finish up by rubbing on jojoba oil.I don't think the soap is watery at all for a natural soap I got good lather from it.I think I will try a different smell next time but other than that I love it. I got this castile soap to make DIY body wash with. The texture of the soap is great and it seems very effective. It also lathers more than the other brand I used to buy, which both my husband and I appreciate. We did not have any breakouts or other skin issues. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the overpowering almond scent - the soap sort of smells like marzipan. It's a very sweet smell, and I would have preferred something more ""natural"""
314,B0001TSJPI,"Again a wonderful product well done beautifully packaged glass wonderful thank you very much I first tried this soap at a vacation rental we had and couldn't find the soap or figure out how to. Then I thought of Amazon and there it was.....I love the scent. The delivery is FAST......This is my every day soap from now on.....Thanks.... Aroma is too strong Arrived very quick but that's the only good thing I can say about the soap. It doesn't smell like sandalwood, doesn't lather,and the bars are small and very hard. Very irritating soap, dries skin ,very little fragrance. Would not buy again. Probably toss what I bought.Avoid is best move Always a good bargain. Not found everywhere"
315,B000NWF1Q8,"Love it! As a health care professional quite often i. Would much rather bathe with an antibacterial soap. Although this soap isn't antibacterial i would still highly recommend it. It smells great and is ultra moisturizing! My dermatologist suggested I use oatmeal soap to improve dry skin. I picked Yardley and it really works. Within a couple of weeks you could see and feel the difference. The scent is nice, clean. I’ve already reordered, don’t want to be without this product. Yes I I like very much The smell is fantastic, not cloying..gently exfoliating.  It’s the only soap my husband (and I) will use! Shower This soap leaves your body feeling very clean!"
316,B000Z61SKU,"Maybe not the best ingredients, but the smell is addictive. Raspberry scent, it lifts up the mood. I’ve been using Ancona Cranberry Toner for  several months now, and I assure you it’s worth the price.  My skin looks hydrated, softer, cleaner and does not dry out my skin.  🌟 I started using this product about a month ago to test and I ma completely in love with it. First of all, this product have only natural components without any alcohol, which is really rare for tonics and I extremely appreciate it in skincare products. Secondly, it has a wonderful lightly sweet and fresh at the same time sent without using alcohol based fragrances. Finally, I love it tones the skin and can be used as a make up remover, which is an amazing alternative. Also, I read some reviews that skin breaks out when you start using this product, and I am not surprised. You need to give some time to your skin in order to adapt to the product. Since I use the Arcona moisturizer for my face, it was not a long process, maybe couple of days.In the end, I want to recommend this product as a great  cleaning product for morning and evening before moisturizer. If you think that your skin is too sensitive, ask someone who already has this product to test for a week or so, and I am sure you will fall in love with it. I'm ADDICTED to this toner. Not only is it refreshing, you really feel as if you've cleansed your skin--and it feels that way for at least an hour afterward. The scent is more pronounced in the pads than in the bottle of toner. The scent has never bothered me, as it has others--it is light, and fruity, and perhaps not for everyone, but I like it . And the toner itself? Well, it feels good--good consistency. It is pricey, but worth it. I've used a number of toners over the years, and this is one of the few that goes above and beyond. You can even use it to remove makeup!If you are thinking about trying this toner, do. I coveted it for over a year (didn't want to spend that much on an unknown product), and received a sample through a different source. Haven't used anything else since. It is one of those products that daily lifts your spirits and becomes part of your permanent rotation. Just as a note--I prefer the toner on its own to the pads--yes the container which includes pads is convenient, but I feel that the pads are oversaturated (I believe another reviewer mentioned this as well) and messier (despite being of good quality) than my regular cotton squares :( Originally got this as a ""larger"" sample.  It was worth the company's expenditure.  I've been purchasing it for several years now - and it's not  inexpensive.  But it is wonderful.  I clean my face religiously, but in the last year have gotten a bit slack on how vigorously I do it at night.  some nights (the ones where I've been inside on the computer all day and have no make-up on), a swipe of this over my whole face is all I do.  And EVERY day that is all I do in the morning.  It is a complete and perfect multi-tasker - REALLY & FINALLY!  It's worth the money.  To save time and surprisingly some of the toner as well, I use one of those bottles with a pump action lid like they use to use with alcohol and cotton balls and two bottles of this - used twice a day, lasted me over half a year!  It is wonderful! The ONLY reason I won't give this product five stars is because of the following: BOTH times I have ordered this, I have had the bottle break on me. Now, I'm not totally reckless with my things - I'm talking just knocking it over on accident (it's a tall bottle!) and BOOM - completely shatters on my bathroom counter. The plastic is thin and frail, and sadly, both times I have lost at least half the bottle to these accidents. It's never happened with another product, so I partly blame the thin plastic they use.That said, this is the best toner I have ever used and I will continue to buy it (I'm seriously considering transferring it to another container, though!)! It not only smells incredibly wonderful, but it feels so nice, cleans my skin beautifully and doesn't ever dry it out.BOTTOM LINE: Lovely product, but needs better bottling considering how expensive it is - yikes!! Completely cleans skin, best toner, gentle, and cruelty free! This product is a game changer for me. Other toners dry my skin. This one is perfect and smells soooo good"
317,B00021C49W,"Smells so good, bubbles easy Has an amazing smell if u want to indulge yourself make u feel beautiful,,, but for the price it should last even after stepping out the shower… kinda disappointed 🙁 I love this spray. I'm going to look for another amazing grace fragrance . Highly recommend I was introduced to this scent years ago from  a good friend, and loved it.  I have been buying all the product ever since, it is the only scent I use, and I get compliment all the time. My wife uses it After reading other reviews, I realized this is a spritz. That’s exactly what I was looking for with work and every day use. Scent is beautiful once it settles into your skin. No heavy parfum smell. Slight rubbing alcohol smell if you spray it in the air. But it’s meant to be sprayed directly on you skin, not sprayed and walked through like parfume! I love everything about it!  Dry off after a shower/bath and spray all over. Lovely. Great deals love this scent My wife had puchased it before and currently could not find it anywhere and she loved it so much. I searched on Amazon and found it much cheaper so I got it for her for Christmas, I scored a lot of brownie points."
318,B0000AN9L9,"I've tried so many different soaps and cleansers but I always come back to this. I like Neutrogena soap:  very little scent and ideal for “sensitive” skin.  In fact, I like it enough that I ordered six bars…unfortunately, only one arrived. The seller said this isn’t their fault because Amazon packaged it.  So far, Amazon isn’t responding.  I’m tempted to walk over to South Lake Union and bang on a door, although that probably won’t work either (too many doors).  Any suggestions? I have used this product on my face for over 50 years. I think that speaks for my opinion of the product. Service and delivery were perfect. I bought this for my mom who has used Neutrogena products for decades. She is sensitive to fragrances but this soap works well with her skin. She likes how cleanly it rinses off and is pleased with how well it cleanses her face. The soap arrived at her house within the time frame indicated. No problems with the seller or the delivery. My mom thanks you! I read the reviews before I bought this “original” scent Neutrogena soap.I had recently used some of this and enjoyed the scent and the clean feeling of my skin. I thought the scent was interesting and somewhat manly. My problem was that original box was gone.Upon reading the reviews, I learned that there was an unscented and an original scent. Viola! What I was enjoying must be the “original” scent, so I ordered it.To my dismay, the soap that I received did not have the same scent as the bar I was first using. Not even close.So, either Neutrogena has more than 2 scent options or they have changed their “original” scent.Either way, I now have a six-pack of soap that I am not crazy about. It still gives a good clean feel, but .... I have been using this soap for years.  I love the scent and the way it makes my skin feel.  Not oily, but moisturized.  I personally think that this is the best soap ever. x I love the fragrance and doesn't dry my skin."
319,B0011DHA3A,"I decided to do some research in order to find a more budget-friendly alternative to the really expensive Bliss eye cream that I had been using. After reading many great reviews on this firming cream, and the wonderful price, I decided it was worth a try. I also purchased I'm only giving 3 stars because while I believe the eye cream is the best I've found (I've been using it for years and always come back after trying other brands), my order contained BARELY HALF FULL CONTAINERS!!  Typically the container is filled to the top and the product is thick & fluffy light...but not the 2 that I ordered.  The containers HAD to have been opened before and either used or ?? because there was product dried up around the edges of the containers under the little clear plastic cover that protects the product.  The product itself was very thick as if it were drying up.  I tried to use it but am grossed out thinking it was used.  I'm very upset that someone would try to fool the buyer.  I've bought so many of these containers that I know what it looks like, the consistency, and the amount in the container...THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I RECEIVED WITH MY PURCHASE.  HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!! This eye cream is soothing and actually lasts a while. I like to apply this in the evening paired with the Reviva DMAE face night cream. It does have a tightening effect when it dries. It also has a silky texture that becomes somewhat tacky when applied, then quickly dries. I am pleased with the results, especially at this price point this is a great value. I like that it is not full of chemicals, I have sensitive skin and I always have to read labels and choose natural products. For more severe under eye wrinkling or very dark circles you may need something more powerful to correct. I have been using this inexpensive eye cream for about three years now and I love it.  It is very moisturizing yet not greasy, and it provides delicate eye skin with the nourishment it needs to prevent fine lines and wrinkles.  I have tried more expensive department store creams too and have not achieved such great results. I am 40 and even though my skin is in good shape, I am at the age now where one starts to notice fine lines, especially around the eyes. The skin around my eyes feels soft and voluminous and is not dry or wrinkly. I attribute it to using this cream and other Reviva products.  I intend to use this product as long as they keep making it! I bought this as an eye cream, but after my other brand face products keep giving me those little fat bumps(i guess my face is just sensitive to the chemicals), I tried this on. I was pleasantly surprised that it gave my face a much smoother feel and no irritation at all. The ""all natural"" label does work! Now it has become my night cream,day primer, and of course eye cream!Updates: it seems they changed the formula, the one with Red Vine was much better than the current one, the color was translucent for the old one but the current one is like a white cream. The old one is more protective and you can feel that it moisturises your skin and make it more supple, but the current one burns a bit and doesn't have the effects of the previous. I think they cheaped out in ingredients. I am pretty impressed by this eye cream especially given the budget-friendly price point!1. It is absorbed more quickly than any other eye cream I've used. Just a few taps and it soaks right in!2. I love how comfortable it feels on my skin. Not greasy at all, but light, soothing, refreshing and hydrating.3. What's not to love about the natural botanical ingredients? I also like that the scent is light.4. I just started using this and so far, definitely notice the skin around my eyes staying hydrated longer. I can't wait to see if it'll lighten my dark undereye circles and fine lines. This is a good product that has left a great impression on me. I am now at the age and in the profession where those stress lines begin to show. This is a nice, non-greasy cream that goes on easily and doesn’t feel too heavy after applied. It doesn’t really have a scent, which is good for users who suffer with sinusitis like myself and it moisturizes the skin as well. It has just been a few days and I have begun to see a noticeable difference in the lines. Looking less stressed and younger is always welcome. I will definitely continue using as this is an extremely good bargain at this price level. Was very pleased to find that I could use this eye cream and have no resulting redness or itching.  I seem to be allergic to many eye creams, even those for sensitive skin; so this was a gamble that paid off.  It is a soft, non-greasy eye cream, and I hope it provides the moisture I need around my aging eye area.  So far I am quite happy with it and will hope for good results as I continue to use it."
320,B0001EKTZQ,"I like the toner a lot. I purchased the cleanser & cream too. Great Product use it every morning along with Jack Black Face Moisturizer. Really wakens the skins and helps hydrate. Smells nice and light and the spray bottle method is much better. I’ve been using dermalogica for years. This product was new to me. It works well. I’ve noticed a difference if the effectiveness of my moisturizer since starting to use this product I like this Hydrating facial toner that help condition my skin with break-out free . This product has been an absolute blessing for my skin. I not only use this but I also use the moisturizer as well. I have seen a significant change in my skin tone, being an African American woman, as well as with the moisturizer just making my face to feel smooth, well balanced, and not rough in any kind of way. Just really love the changes to my skin!! The strength and effectiveness of this toner is not the same. Something has changed. It’s a hassle to use cotton balls for toner, this is an excellent toner quick and refreshing to use. I tried many different products and I keep coming back to dermatologica"
321,B001CL6QG8,"At first, I thought, ""wow... spendy stuff!"" But a little goes a long ways and I am sold on this line of skin care. It's organic; no issues with breakouts or skin reactions and it smells nice :-) We love this product!!The results are amazing !! A little lighter in texture than some night cremes but still very effective in making the skin feel refreshed in the morning! I know there are some poor reviews on here but this product is the legit product.  I’ve been using it now for a couple of weeks.  My skin feels soft, smoothe, moisturized and the smell is completely heavenly.  I don’t know what experiences other people have had with this seller but my experience was very good.  I’ve been using eminence for a long time so I am very familiar with their products.  The white writing on this label on this product is the true product.  See for yourself on the main eminence website.  I know what eminence is supposed to feel like as I’ve played around with a dozen of their products.  This one is bar far my favorite except for maybe the facial recovery oil which is a miracle oil.  Anyways, buy it, you won’t be disappointed!  My skin is on the dry side.  I’m 36 years old, fair skin and sensitive. great product. Mine arrived opened, the seal clearly opened and some product in the lid . It did not look full either and had no eminence box. I had to return, i hope my replacement is new. Great moisturizing night cream. This night cream is ""off-the-charts-amazing""!!! It is concentrated, so a tiny bit goes a very long way and I fully expect it to last a few months. I've only been using it for a week so far, but I swear my skin is softer, yet firmer in only that amount of time! And the smell!!! It is absolutely DIVINE! I love the smell so much, that I'd probably buy it even if it didn't work so well, just for the glorious smell!  ;-) I also appreciate that it is organic and isn't loaded with chemicals and preservatives. Though I have 57 year old mature skin and live in a very dry climate and therefore use this full strength and like it's thick consistency, it would be easy to slightly dilute it with water to thin it down for someone with younger skin who doesn't want it quite so thick. I can't say enough good things about this product! I will continue to buy it in the future!"
322,B000VDYXT0,"This was my first time using a self tanning spray and I really liked it! I’m typically a tanning bed girly but I’m opting for skin friendly solutions these days. This solution gave me a beautiful glow and didn’t make me look orange. Smell was nice at first but then next day it did start to smell like tanning spray solution just a little bit - but not terrible! It did get lighter after showering the next day but I did like the instant tan it gave me. Will definitely be purchasing more! I usually use bondi sands and wanted something more “easier”. With this you only need 1 coat, I put it on at night and waited until the next morning to wash off and it turned out so good. It doesn’t transfer onto your sheets either but I’d definitely recommend using it outside or putting a towel down when you do use it inside because it will be all over your floor. 10/10 recommend. i like the color a lot! The spray is easy, the color is fantastic, no streaking, and best of all there is no bad odor! I’ve used a lot of self tan lotions and sprays and this one is my all time favorite. Super easy to use. Totally covers my rosacea. Great color and well worth the very reasonable price I paid. I highly recommend buying and trying this awesome sunless tanning product! This is perfect in my opinion.  Easy to use, even coat, mild scent and easy to maintain.  Buy two! AlsoFor any dark areas or to clean cuticles or knuckles and ankles use Garnier micelualar water! It's like a tide pen for false tan! I LOVE using this when i’m in between tans, or when my face tan wears off! I love that it makes me more sunkissed rather than orange. It smells so good also! it’s instant but ofc no self tans are going to be perfect. i love how dark it makes you though and it’s quick you just have to rinse off and it stains your clothes"
323,B0011NR3EQ,"This exfoliating wash is mild and gentle as an everyday facial wash. After using it for two weeks, I am finding that the older skin texture is beginning to improve. Got as a sample, tried it…loved it! One of the few things in my skin repetoire that I go to again and again. I have been buying this for years and have never had any issues. I have tried other similar products, but always return to it! The scrub is subtle and gentle enough for everyday use but it's very effective. Will continue to buy for years to come! I love the smell and feel of the this product.  The only issue is actually dispensing the product into your hands.  It requires a death grip to squeeze some through the cap.  I end up just removing the cap to access and squeeze what I can.  There has to be a better way… This facial cleanser is awesome and really does a great job for me.  BUT, the bottle is too freaking fat and hard to handle in the shower.  I wish they would make the bottle more slender but with the same amount of product.  Also maybe add a pump on the top, just like that Hawaiian Facial Cleanser, so easy to use. I happen to receive a free bottle of this from a friend. Made my skin nice and smooth. My son was having some bad teenage acne, not cystic, so I had him use it, it’s worked wonders for his skin, that is when he’s consistent with it... teenagers. Definitely use it for acne! I ended up buying this big bottle for him. I have always suffered from acne since I was a pre-teen. Although it is not severe, it is enough to make me feel self conscious, especially as an adult. My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil for my sensitive skin and I had been using that for several years but I always noticed that no matter how much I washed my face, my acne would never go away completely. I remember my roommate using the simple one step face wash in college (years ago) and since she is someone who always took care of her skin, I thought I'd try this brand too and I am SO glad I did! My face has cleared up and looks so much better. My skin is not only softer, but it is brighter, clearer, and just looks much more improved. My husband has even started using this face wash in the shower and he has mentioned how much cleaner his face feels and how much softer his skin is (this is coming from someone who has never used face wash).  I have sensitive skin and I pair this with the simple one step cleanser in the morning and use the exfoliating cleanser at night. I always love this facial scrub very good for sensitive skin"
324,B000Z4SIBY,"Had clarifying #2 & #3 so tried this one and it does smell different. Don’t know if that’s the only one or not….. what makes it gender neutral? Idk. Good price though. Good My Holy Grail toner!! Been using this since my teenaged acne days (like >15 years ago??) and I'll go on and off and try other products just to see what they're like, and this one REALLY IS the secret to smoothing out my bumpy skin and clearing up all the oil and junk deep within my skin- I just wake up with super smooth looking, PORELESS SKIN!! It really helps clear up acne, but it's super gentle at the same time. I use it morning and night, three inversions on a cotton round, and wipe my face all over, really exfoliating the top surface of my skin. I looooove the refreshing and cooling feeling of the toner evaporating off my skin (yes there's probably a bit of alcohol in it but it's NOT DRYING AT ALL). Love love love; don't think I'll ever stray again~ I’m a 44 yr old female who’s had problem skin my entire adult life. I’m very oily and acne prone. Until I learned what was breaking out my face so much, I had horrible outbreaks. Finally got the acne under control by using PanOxyl per my dermatologists directions. It did the job of clearing up my skin, but I needed help with the damage that’s been done. I’m only in to using this Clarifying lotion 3 and the face wash for a week. I had been using the Moisturizing Gel and loved it so much that I ordered the complete set. I absolutely love what this whole set is doing for my skin! I’m already noticing a big difference in the overall tone, texture and luminance of my complexion. If you have combo to oily skin, and/or past damage from acne, I highly recommend this entire Clinique set! Strong alcohol smell from nose to bottle but on your face it is unnoticeable. After using the facial soap which is nice, this clarifying lotion/toner (TO MY SURPRISE) finished off clearing out raised clogged pores or imperfections. I think this is a necessity in the 3 step Clinique routine. If you finish with a suitable moisturizer it doesn't dry you out. I use the clinique ID and needed a little extra moisture to my nose that i corrected with jojoba oil. Overall smooth skin I have always loved Clinique products but I find it so easy to order from here and it’s the same product with quick delivery.  I have semi oily skin but dry sometimes as I’m getting older and this product is perfect ... doesn’t dry me out but cleans my skin! Nothing has ever worked this well in my combination skin, I am a clean and clear user for over 8 years. This lotion has been great addition to my skin routine, I follow my cleanse with this lotion and then add moisturizer above! It has been working well. Now that my skin is maturing I have noticed the blue formula being a bit drying. Therefore I began switching to pink 4 out of the 7 times per week. It may sound excessive but by switching between them I lengthen the time before I need to buy more. Amazon has a great price which is a game changer!"
325,B0009JQFF6,"I bought this Shea Butter on March 11, 2010.  I ordered two 16 ounce containers, accidently.  I recieved them by the 17th.  Today, August 9th, we have several tablespoons of the frist container left.  Five months, of intensive use isn't bad.  I'm thinking that we should be done with that in the next week or two and I'm getting impatient to whip up the next batch.  I gave away several heaping tablespoons to friends, also.After reading the other reviews, I decided to try beating the Shea Butter in my my Kitchen Aid Stand mixer, with the flat beater.  I added some lavender essential oil at the end, which didn't affect the scent much but didn't hurt it either.  The Shea Butter came out light and fluffy.  I filled one 16 ounce container full and filled another one about 3/4 of the way full after whipping it.  I don't have a problem with the scent.  It's slightly nutty and fades after putting it on your skin. If the scent truly bothers you, maybe you should check out Candida Overgrowth as being over sensitive to scents can be a symptom.My 8yo daughter suffers from both food (wheat, gluten, dairy, nightshades, grains, etc) and environmental sensitivities.  She seems to have the Scratch to Rash symptoms of Eczema when she comes in contact with items that bother her.  Because of these sensitivities, she gets horrible, bumpy, itchy rashes that she scratches until she's bloody.  If you've ever had a bad, itchy rash, you know that no amount of discipline can keep you from scratching something that itches that badly.  Since March, we've discovered that when she comes in contact with something that she shouldn't have (food or in the environment) and starts to get a rash, we have her take a cool shower and then put a generous layer of Shea Butter over the rashy areas.  This seems to reduce the itchiness and inflamation.  These rashes used to take about 3 weeks to recover from, start to finish.  By using the shower and shea butter, it cuts the time down to less than a week.  More often than not, her rash looks much better by the following morning and with continued use of the Shea Butter she is almost back normal in 2-3 days.  By the end of the week, she's healed and you can't tell she ever had a rash!  Compared to the weeks of itching, scratching, crying and in general being miserable, while getting this stuff out of her system, this is a miracle.  Never the less, my daughter doesn't like putting Shea Butter on her rash.  Because it's so itchy, and we have to touch the rash to put the Shea Butter on, it's not comfortable to apply it, even though after beating it in the mixer, it's light and fluffy.  She also says that it feels like she's putting shortening on her skin and doesn't like the way it feels.  However, within about 30 minutes after applying it, the itchiness is reduced to being bearable and the Shea Butter is absorbing into the skin.I use shea butter on my feet elbows and hands after I shower.  The soles of my feet used to be dry and scratchy.  They're smooth and soft now.Shea butter also works great on chapped lips.  I recommend putting a bit of water on your chapped lips so they are very slightly moist and then putting a generous layer of Shea Butter over that, right before bed.  When you wake up, your lips will feel and look much better.  If you have cracked or severely chapped lips, you might need to do this more than one night but the results are amazing!  During the end of our dry Colorado winter, I snuck into my kid's rooms, at night and smeared Shea Butter on their lips (without the water routine.)  Doing that kept them from getting dry, chapped and cracked when they normally would have been a mess!I haven't tried it on our hair as a pre-conditioner, yet but I plan to do so with the next batch.I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry or rashy skin. when I opened the package i was really excited then i looked down and saw two containers filled with yellow stuff...I had to go home and check amazon right away because i thought i clicked the wrong product to buy....nope...seller just advertised different item.I was expecting to get whats shown in the picture which is a big raw piece of shea butter, they instead sent two food grade plastic containers filled with yellow stuff with no protective plastic sealing or anything anyone could open it and use it then close it again, send it back then they send it to you...honestly will never buy this again Im affraid to use it on my body....I did some more research and found Fair Trade...I've never heard of them I found them on google but they have a nice site that explains EVERYTHING about shea butter and as another review said this seller sends you Kpangana butter, I know I spelled that wrong...but you will know what I mean if you read the FAQ's on Fair Trade...I found out that REAL raw shea butter is much more expensive and it was my own ignorance of shea butter that lead me to believe I could buy it so cheap....I doubt i will even use this butter that was sent on my feet even though i bought it for my face. I will probably just take the loss and throw it away....for someone who doesn't care what they rub on their skin then I would recommend this fake shea butter.... I did contact the seller and they said this :Dear Customer:Thank you so much for the message.Please be kind enough to allow me to explain as follows:1.I purchased this item from an African importer. He delivered the big shells (like coconut) to me. Each shell (egg) contains about 50 pounds. I digged it out from the shell and put into the food-grade containers and then I weighed it by digital scale. This is the way I sell shea butter cream;2. The quality of the shea butter is excellent and this is the fresh shipment.I suggest that you try it. You'll like it. If you don;t like it, please let me know. I'll make the refund to you.I'm customer-oriented. My phone number is xxxxxxxxxx.Have a nice day.which is nice enough but of course they will recommend I try it.. Their selling it lol.....but why would i try something that I didn't even buy?  anyway I replied back and asked why they don't just put a picture of what they actually send you on ther website.....We'll see what they say....I already know the answer though...very few people would waste the money if they saw what was actually sent . hope this was helpful.Heres an updateAnother thing they keep telling me it's weighed with digital scales.... and I have yet to see how much it weighs you can't find that info anywhere! plus who cares how much it weighs....I just wanted Pure shea butter and BTW I ended up rubbing a very little on the bottom of my feet and my feet were stained yellow lol it's gross I cant beleive i tried it.-------------------------------------This is the email i received after leaving the above negative feedback....Dear Mrs. Rebecce:Good afternoon.Re: Kindly & Urgently Request for the Removal of the Negative Feedback for Amazon Order ID#xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI'm a 1oo% customer-oriented seller.

326,B000VCN6KI,"This facial wash is wonderful.  Leaves your skin very soft.  Have bought several bottles so far and would  highly recommend this product. Works well I love this product. I have  been using this product for a few years. I use it twice a day after washing my face and before putting on facial cream. It has a wonderful gentle smell and your skins feels so nice. No dryness or irritation. I wanted to try on several skin issues. I purchased it as a vehicle to apply the CoQ10.  Instantly improve a blemished skin appearance. Its the best cleanser i have used so far . The best thing i liked about this cleanser is that it doesn't leave any residue on your face hence doesn’t clog your pores. Just make sure you use a washcloth afterwards to remove it.Really good for mature and wrinkly skin. This toner is the best I have ever used! This cleansing milk is amazing! I have adult acne, and I have been trying to keep my breakouts at bay. I take prescription pills and cream to try to help. I have been using I am 61 years old and have been using this product for about 10 years.  When I was a teenager and into my late 30's, I used a product called 10 0 6 lotion by Bonne Bell because I had frequent breakouts.  As I got older, it was far too harsh and drying.  I began using various other products at that point, but not until I found Avalon's Perfecting Toner did my skin begin to really look good.  My work involved long hours and often I was too tired to do a full facial cleansing routine late at night.  Still, I didn't want to go to bed with a dirty face.  So, I began moistening cotton pads with this product to cleanse my face as well.  Took off all the makeup and dirt easily, no breakouts and I noticed my pores began to appear smaller.  Today, I begin and end my day with Avalon Toner, and although I no longer fall into bed too exhausted at night to complete my cleansing routine, I can tell you that my skin has never looked better!  Few wrinkles, tight pores, clear skin, minimal sagging.  I won't stop using it unless  they stop making it.....and you truly cannot beat Amazon's price.  In order to get the free shipping, I place my order for 3-5 bottle at a time.  My last order was for 3 and they lasted me from Nov. '13 until now, Sept.'15.  I am a VERY pleased customer!"
327,B0016J22EQ,"Nice sunless tanner without extra chemicals. Smell isn’t as bad as the high chemical brands. Product works great If I was using it on my body, I might have been disappointed with the subtlety, but, it’s the perfect tone for my face. It is, however, thick for a moisturizer. It smells like it once was orange cream scented, but has began to turn. It’s not bad, though. I’ll probably buy it again because it’s a really good tone on my face. And, the cost is reasonable. I love the brand. As far as color goes, the color develops quickly and is not orange. The avtive ingredient  in these kinds of sunless tanners is DHA (dihydroxyacetone) which stimulates skin production of melatonin. The color is natural looking (except on drier, thicker skin areas  like the palms, sides/bottoms of feet, elbows etc.) If you put more than just a teensy bit there - they'll  be orangey. Or, at least they were for me. I also streaked on the insides of my wrists and forearms despite rubbing in completely.  I am naturally very fair skinned (for you cosmetologists my veins appear blue.)I used to work in a tanning salon, but I've started having weird skin reactions to certain lotions. So far, this lotion has not caused me to break out. I used to use  Jergens Gradual Glow on my face and body until the face lotion broke me out into bad hives and swelled. (Used it for years with no problem - still looking into whether they changed their formula. )The smell is okay, not my favorite personally, but I didn't buy it for scent.  I bought it for color.I gave 4 stars because it does smooth on nicely and it does give good natural color. I took away a star because it streaks pretty badly. I've  used  indoor and outdoor tanning lotions and this one streaks like the tanning foams do. I like Alba's tanning lotion. The scent could be a little nicer, but the best improvement would be a better price 😉 I have histamine intolerance so finding a product that doesn't cause rashes, break outs, wheezing due to cloying scents, is tricky. My previous product by nature's gate was discontinued and I was so sad. I gave this a try, hoping the scent wouldn't be perfumey and sicken me or cause skin irritation. It is amazing. I am buying my third container right now. Please don't ever discontinue this product! I am pale with freckles but this goes on and leaves a natural looking tan without being orange. I want something that feels light, with a refreshing scent, no streaking, no fake n bake. The scent is citrusy to me because of the orange and grapefruit oils in it but the sweet almond adds a touch of sweetness, to me it smells tropical and I love that. I apply to my face after every shower, just a thin amount and my arms and legs. It lasts me months. Sometimes I stack color if I'm gardening 2 or 3 days in a row because I moisturize beforehand. If you're looking for dramatic color then you will probably be disappointed. If you are fair skinned and just want to look less like a ghost it will fit you perfectly and NATURALLY. Off to buy another! *the wife* Good for toning up the winter pallor. I use it all over and on my face. I really liked this product, except it was a little yellowing to the skin. Other than that, it was easy to apply and it did look like I had a tan!"
328,B000REIM1S,"I love how silky smooth it feels on my skin and the thick foam. You can use it after chemical peels or other facial treatments. It also helped a lot with my acne. I use it with the elta md am moisturizer and sunscreen Clean your face but dries it out quickly; after the wash, your face feels stripped.  It's not gentle Great product. Cleanses my skin without harsh chemicals. I have been using the EltaMD tinted sunscreen for a while and thought I would try this cleanser. I am happy I did! It works really well at getting my mascara off, it isn't instant, but it worked better than the previous cleanser I was using. I have noticed if I have a full face of makeup on, and it has been 14+ hours, the cleanser doesn't foam up, but still does an amazing job at removing my makeup. I really like that I can open my eyes, with the soap on my face, and my eyes don't burn. I have repurchased this 3 times and will continue to.I did buy some 'Flip It' lids, because I had a problem getting all the cleanser to come out with the pump, though. Cleaning my skin. If your skin is oily, this is a good choice I just want to say that I absolutely love this facial cleanser. I have been using EltaMD products for about ten years and it came highly recommended by my dermatologist who is excellent and highly knowledgeable. I have very sensitive skin and what I love about this product is that it really does leave your face feeling nice and clean. I can honestly say I have never felt my skin feel oily or my pores feeling clogged like most over the counter products do that you would find at CVS. Also, it's really great for washing off make-up before bedtime. Although, I have discovered that if you use Aveeno Facial Cleansing wipes first to remove the make-up and then use the EltaMD Facial Cleanser next that it gives your face a really good deep cleaning afterwards before applying any kind of anti-aging cream. I am so grateful for Amazon and for this seller because my dermatologist is about 25 miles northeast from where I live and honestly I am saving so much gas, time, and money. Plus my dermatologist sells EltaMD in her office and literally charges you and arm and a leg for just one bottle of facial cleanser, which to me is not worth it especially now that I have Amazon at my fingertips. I can tell a difference in my pores and it leaves my skin soft and clean.  I'll order more products from this brand after trying this cleanser.  Have been using it now for about a month and will reorder from now on."
329,B00157RZ14,"I didn't pay attention to size for $$$ amount I feel like this serum literally tightens the skin around my eyes instantly. A friend bought some while we were at the Dead Sea & let me use it. I was on a mission to find some of this serum as soon as I get home! It is a little bit pricey but well worth it! Update : Customer service contacted me and gave me an option to get a refund or expedited new one.  I got my refund.  I gave more stars as their customer service was good but still only 4 stars as I didn't get to try out their product.Original  : My in laws swear this stuff is amazing so I ordered for the first time.  I thought I was supposed to get a new version (white bottle) but the old version of green came.  What's the point of advertising that they got a brand new face lift but then sells the older stuff.  It feels deceiving.  However, I didn't even get to use it as the bottle was ejected from the original package and broke among the other stuff in the box.  My other items in the package got to wear the serum. Condition of product when delivered was poor. This is exactly what the description states. Great Product 👍 Doesn't irritate my eyes . Leaves area nice and smooth. I have been using the premier eye serum for 9 months and I like the consistency.  I do think it has prevented eye wrinkles.  I paid a lot more money for it at the kiosk in the mall where the women are very persuasive and act like ""you are killing them"" when you don't pay the asking price.  I think they wanted $140.00 for the eye serum.  I paid $88. I think.  I am in Florida for the winter and needed more.  I figured I would check on-line and found the same product for under $35.00.  It was actually sent from Israel in the identical bottle so I know it is the real thing.  It took a while to get here, but there was no tax and no shipping fee.  It doesn't get any better than that.  My only negative comment would be that I only need a little bead of the serum, and it is difficult to press the blue top down enough to get something, but not too much that you get more product than you need.  I will order the eye serum again through Amazon. The last three bottles of Premier Dead Sea products I've received have had defective bottles. I've not been able to set them up for push-button dispensing, and have had to transfer the lotion (undoubtedly losing some in the process) to a small plastic bottle. I can't believe I'm the only one having this issue, but I urge you to get it fixed. I like the product, but I'm really getting frustrated with the shoddy dispenser. To repeat my review: Unless you can verify that you'll be fixing the bottles, I will no longer be buying the product. My three star is to average out the product, which I would give a 5 star to, and the bottle, which I would give a zero star for."
330,B0012C7POY,"I have tried hundreds of dollars worth out of desperation for my acne. After about three days of using this I noticed improvement and it got better from then on. I experienced no irritation or burning. A bonus from the active ingredient is that it exfoliates (removes dead cells that - combined with other acne issues- clogs pores. Yes, it is relatively pricey, but the confidence and quality pays for itself. Highly recommended. Quick delivery and great product! My daughter had problem skin but this product works so well for her!! Helped with my skin.I used it for mixed Typ of skin and it really helped keeping my skin nice Wonderful facial cleanser and soft scrub..  Have used it for years and has done wonders for my skin. I used this product for years and then decided to try a cheaper product.  Nope, I'm back using Proactiv and I will keep using it.  It is the best in my opinion. My daughter has been using proactive for years, ever since her early teens and it’s the only treatment that helps with cystic acne for her. I like that they do not make you buy a whole kit again when one or two run out faster than the others and you can buy them separately like this. Honestly it is worth the money even though it is on the more pricey side of acne treatments, but it works well and actually lasts for like 3 months before you need to buy more. The cleanser showed up in new condition. It works as advertised, we notice a difference when we run out."
331,B000L1AY3G,"This product was suggested to me by Amazon because of my purchase of the Maxboost Waist Trimmer, which I love and purchased to enhance my workout. My review for that is on here too. Based on the reviews for this Albolene cleaner, it is supposed to be able to be used as a make up remover, a sweat enhancer, and even a sex lubricant. Well I have used it for 2 out of the 3 suggested uses and I  can personally say that it is the best make up remover that I  have ever used. It was weird though because it is like a vaseline texture. If you look at the ingredients, they are petroleum, mineral oil,  beta carotene,  ceresin and paraffin. So of course it feels like vaseline. I was very skeptical that it would work but a I slapped the gloopy concoction on my face and began to gently rub in small circles. To my amazement, the makeup came of easily, even my waterproof eyeliner and mascara easily came of. No raccoon eye or residual line or mascara,  which are the hardest for me to remove. This product did the job. ...kinda makes me wonder if vaseline would also work but that's an experiment for another day. Now I don't know if this is actually cleaning my face or just removing the makeup but either way,  so far so good. You also don't have that drying feeling that comes from constantly washing your face to remove makeup. So I guess it is moisturizing also. The product also says that no soap or water are needed, just a cloth to wipe off the greasy mixture but I use a cloth that is wet with warm water to remove it. It probably isn't necessary but makes me feel better. I was so impressed by its ability to remove makeup that I decided to try it as a sweat enhancer under my Max boost waist trimmer. However I was disappointed with the results. To me it didn't really make me sweat more than the waist trimmer did on its own. If it did, it wasn't a significant difference.  Yeah there was a good amount of sweat when I removed it but again it would have been like that without using the product. I also wear a shape enhancer under my clothing all day and I tried to use the product under that as well to enhance sweat but again the results were disappointing. So as a sweat enhancer I give it two stars, as a makeup remover I give it 5 stars and as a sex lubricant, well... you'll have to try that one yourself but there is a review on here from some guy saying that it works great for that also. However,  the stated use on the bottle is as a makeup remover/facial cleanser. The other uses are just for fun. I have been looking for a makeup remover that didn't require me to scrub like hell to get eye makeup off. I found this, read all the reviews, and though sweeeet - lets try it. I'm gonna be negative nancy and hit the cons first. Cause that's how I rollCons:Its on the greasy side. Its maybe a hair thinner then vasoline but that's pretty much what it feels like on your face. I have semi oily skin and break out like Freddy Kruger around shark week (feel me ladies?) So you can imagine the trepidation I had when applying this on my face. Last thing I need is my niece wanting to play connect the dots on my face. All that said, I've used it twice on my full face and haven't broken out. I still stopped using it because, even with 500 million cotton balls, I still had a greasy feel that I wasn't the biggest fan of. And the zits could come. Anyone else hearing the soundtrack from Jaws. Its a real terror.That's it - that's my one con. And its a personal preference con so take it or leave it.Pros:It does what I wanted it to do which was remove eyeliner and waterproof mascara without making me look like a frickin raccoon when I'm done. Before this, I'd start gently wiping at my eye with Clinique eye remover water crap. All that did was smear everything everwhere turning me into a very sloppy cat burglar. To get it off, I had to go to war and lost. Too many times did I lose (tear).Though this stuff doesn't get it all off in one swipe, It does in a few very gentle passes. And, the greasy feel isn't so bad around the eyes plus I think its good for delicate skin. But what the hell do I know really. I'm just happy I found an eye makeup remover that works and works well. My fiance no longer screams in horror when I'm done. That's a win.So to sum this all up - as of right now, I still wash my face with a mild facial soap cleaner. But this stuff is my go to for stubborn eye makeup. With the size of the tub and how little you need, its gonna last forever. Double win. I have rosacea along with terribly sensitive skin. If I didn't go to a dermatologist, my skin would be one giant itchy, flaky, blotch. Oh joy! My dermatologist suggested I use this, because it has only 4 or 6 ingredients and won't irritate your skin. Be prepared: this stuff is petrolatum based and is very, very greasy. There is no WAY you can simply rinse it off with water, because it will cleave to your skin like whale blubber. I have found the best way to use it is to lightly dampen the face, rub a SMALL amount of it in a circular motion and then use a soft, warm and wet cloth to remove it. You can tissue it off, but that will leave more residue - great if you have extremely dry skin. It will definitely remove the most stubborn makeup and leave your skin super soft and smooth (I had rough skin before, now my skin is nice and soft and smooth). I use it only at night, and if it is very humid out, I wash a second time with a liquid skin cleanser like cetaphil, to get yet more of the excess off (my skin type is combination). Be careful about getting it in your eyes - it won't hurt you, but it will leave a film that is hard to get rid of. I would recommend using a separate eye makeup remover if you wear eye make up. Clinique's Take The Day Off is a good one. I haven't used it in the summer yet, so I am curious to see how it performs in Houston's heat and humidity. Will it make me too greasy? We shall see! All in all, a very good product.. Nothing special.  Sure there’s a cheaper substitute."
332,B00028OSI0,"It works takes the itch out bug bites and poison ivy. good for minor wounds. awesome I use this daily on my face and a little dab goes along way.  It's also great for any skin irritations. The herbs can cause a slight burning sensation if you have any broken skin. The Aloe Life Skin Gel product was received promptly, so thanks for that. The gel is thick but absorbs quickly. It has a ""natural"" smell to it; it seems that no fragrance was added as far as I can tell (and that's a good thing for anyone whose skin is sensitive to skin products with fragrance in the formula). I purchased the Aloe Skin Gel for eczema along with Sweet Almond Oil and a couple other items in the hopes that at least one of them would help clear up my skin. The almond oil (made by Now Solutions) seems to be working the best for me - it's sold on Amazon and comes in a 16-ounce bottle. I use the almond oil on my hands, arms, shoulders, thighs, legs and feet twice a day. It absorbs quickly because it's a light oil and not greasy. I also purchased ""Babytime by Episencial Soothing Cream - Organic Eczema and Itchy Skin"" (also sold on Amazon) but this product, designed for sensitive baby's skin, seems to have fallen into 3rd place for daily use application - and it costs $11 for a small tube, which won't last long when using it for nearly full body coverage. The Now Solutions sweet almond oil is also reviewed on Amazon and a couple people said a 16-ounce bottle is a large amount of product, but if you have widespread skin issues, you'll be glad you purchased the sweet almond oil in a 16-ounce size. The Aloe life Skin Gel (in an 8 ounce bottle) should last about a month if used liberally twice a day as I've described my use of it above. If you have Eczema, you can save yourself a lot of time by checking out the items I've mentioned, which I purchased to use instead of cortisone cream (expediently prescribed by a dermatologist - what a racket). I also tried Eucerin Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme (14 Ounce Tube) and used this religiously for more than two years, every day. Also Cerave (the body cream and the body lotion). Although both Eucerin and Cerave are dermatologist recommended products, I found that these two products (Cerave and Eucerin) work better after my skin is clear, rather than to clear it up after or during an outbreak. My skin gets really dry in the winter, so I've done a lot of research (really a lot) on how to deal with it. Some additional suggestions include: shower every two days, instead of daily. Wear cotton instead of synthetic fabrics or wool. Don't wash your hands with Dial soap or with any soap with fragrance added. Use Basis soap instead (available on amazon in a six pack). Buy a shampoo that's formulated for sensitive skin (I purchased Sweet Baby Shampoo, 16 oz., Sulfate Free, No Parabens, Phthalates, Dyes, etc.). It smells like coconut which I like. Use a vaporizer in every room in your house, especially in your bedroom. (And good luck finding one you like - none of the vaporizers on amazon are rated as high as I would like). Whatever you do, don't fall into the trap of relying upon cortisone cream. That won't solve the problem and you can't use it daily for full body coverage. Actually Cortisone creams (I've heard) can make your skin thinner. My current favorite solution is the sweet almond oil. ""Babytime by Episencial Soothing Cream - Organic Eczema and Itchy Skin"" is worth trying too, but it may or may not work on your skin. Or, if it does work, it might only work on certain parts of your body but not others. Some people an amazon have also tried sea salt baths, but I would only dip into a salt bath with caution - as it could potentially make your skin problems worse if you're sensitive to salt water (as I am). If you read the Dead Sea Salts reviews on amazon, just keep in mind that a high percentage of the people who posted reviews were given free samples of the produce in exchange for ""an honest review"" but I've rarely seen products on amazon reviewed in such large numbers in exchange for free samples. I hope all of this helps; even if it helps one person, it will be worth the time I took to write this review! I like using this on my body after sugar waxing, or on burns and cuts. But NOT for face. I tried it a couple times and it turned BRIGHT RED! Even my eyelids, which has never happened to me before. So patch test (on face) beforehand. I have been using fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice for many many years.  I love that it is organic and as close as you can get to using the natural aloe plant, but in a convenient bottle that you can travel with or keep in the bathroom.  It is truly a hydrating and moisturizing gel and always makes my skin look fresh and youthful.  I wash my face with raw organic honey and jojoba oil and then mix a small dab of the aloe gel with jojoba oil or another of my favorite facial oils and smooth on my face.  The combination is lovely and flattering for my more mature fair skin and it is my daily moisturizer.  I don't wear foundation of face powder because I feel that they age me, but the aloe gel combined with the facial oil gives my skin a more youthful and dewy appearance. It also gives me a some slight sun protection too from what I understand (I have read that aloe and the facial oils that I use have a natural SPF).  Some people commented about the Aloe gel peeling a bit and that can happen if you use too much of it.  I use a lot more of it at night time and slather it on my face  for maximum benefits but use less during the daytime.A recently discovered other great use for this aloe very is for anti-itch, cooling off and healing mosquito bites.  I was just in West Africa where it was 90 degrees heat and 90 degrees humidity.  I was getting seriously bitten by mosquitos on my legs and ankles and cortizone seemed to make the bites more hot and itchy - I think because it was so hot during the day.  The one thing that I found that truly gave me relief was this aloe vera gel.  I used fresh aloe vera plants when i could find them and fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice gel in addition. Local people were amazed at how quickly my bites healed, that I wasn't scratching them and that I had no scarring.  I would say that the bites disappeared within 3 days.I would recommend fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice to anyone who wants more hydrated youthful looking skin, who wants to heal blemishes quickly and help prevent scarring, who wants natural beauty care for their skin, and who wants a great anti-itch, cooling and healing topical for mosquito bites.  There are many other uses that I have also heard of e.g to cool and heal sunburn.The price of a bottle is very reasonable and a large bottle lasts a long time.  I use the smaller size bottles for traveling and refill them from my bigger bottle."
333,B00094O6D4,"This is the best sugar scrub I have ever used. It is so incredibly moisturizing. I won’t use anything else. I love these body scrubs! I hoped this would be a nice winter smell but the teak overpowers the other scents. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SCRUB! It does soften up when warm and if it’s hard, just warm up the container with warm water. Smells amazing! Actual sugar and leaves my skin as soft as a baby’s bottom. My hubby loves this smell too. Like freshly baked cake or the smell when you walk into a bakery sweet shop. I buy this every couple months and it’s worth every cent! Love this body scrub...it smells so good...a must buy! This product makes your skin feel soft and supple. This is not the real product! I chose to order here in spa treatments to avoid having to buy 2 when I go to the spa and I started breaking out. I was confused because I have been using this scrub for years but never broke out. I used to only buy it at my spa until I found it on Amazon. I also noticed that the sugar crystals are much smaller when ordering on Amazon compared to getting it from my spa. I had my boyfriend take it to his job to test each one and boom this Amazon product is NOT THE REAL THING! This is NOT A REAL LALICIOUS RETAILER. They use small amounts of the real product for the scent and mix it with substitutes. They use sealers and printers to duplicate the lalicious packaging. My skin has broken out so bad and I will be returning this order and canceling my subscription. I’ll just get it from my spa and just pay the larger amount. If you’re gonna sale fake stuff here at least lower the price jeez I have used LaLicious sugar scrub for several years.  Hands down the gold standard when it comes to sugar scrubs.  My skin is so exfoliated and hydrated when I get out of the shower.  I have extremely dry skin and the winter months are worse.  This is my remedy!  The reason for 4 star overall, was only because the box was all dented up and torn in shipping.  This is for my personal use, but if it were a gift, the packaging was hammered and would be embarrassing to give as gift. Truly wonderful product, one which is now a must have for me."
334,B00120U5D4,"You're supposed to use this every night and see a noticeable difference in about two weeks. I'm terrible with skin regiments and I've been using it off and on since I bought it a few months ago and doubt that I've used it every night for at least two weeks, so I can't speak to how well it works in that regard. What I can tell you is that my skin is noticeably softer and smoother when I wake up in the morning. I'm very lucky in that I don't get acne very often, but I think this cream helps keep it at bay as well.One thing I did learn is that there is DEFINITELY a difference between a lotion and a cream and that a little cream goes a long way! If you're not a garbage person like me and actually take care of your skin, you probably already knew this. But I've mostly used lotions my entire life, so this was my first time using a cream and while it definitely feels different on my face (a little heavier), I don't dislike it. The smell is pretty strong, but it's not unpleasant to me. I'm not sure how to describe it. It just smells...clean, I guess.I'm about halfway through the jar and was on the fence about getting another one once this runs out, but I think I will. Before I was using too much and it felt like I was rubbing my face for hours before all the white went away, but now I've figured out how much I should *actually* be using and the experience is much better as a result. Plus I like the smell. I give this product 4.5 stars, but rounded up to 5. I'm in my 30s with sensitive skin and have been using this product in the winters since 2014. Oily t-zone with dry (flaky!) cheeks so it's difficult to keep my whole face happy with just one potion. It's winter here in the Midwest and that means my face is dry and itchy to boot. I've tried many of Alba's lotions (including both Hawaiian creams which are my staples in the summer), but really need some extra oomph to combat winter dryness. I had originally tried this lotion in the summer and it was totally overkill - my face felt like it had on a hydration blanket (not bad, really, just too much). This product is a DREAM in cold weather. It is the only product I've found that keeps my face from getting flaky. I use it every night and sometimes in the morning if I know I'm going to be out in the cold/wind for more than just a jaunt into/out of a store. Beyond the feel, my face looks healthier and breaks out less when it's properly moisturized - and I'm super pale, so I need all the help I can get! I'd give it 5 stars but I wish it didn't have a smell. The other reviewer who said it smells a bit like aftershave is pretty close, though it don't find it to be that strong or as masculine. I don't really mind it, but it's definitely not my favorite. It is certainly not a deal breaker for me.I can't fully speak to the ""evening"" of skin tone when using this stuff, but can say that I've noticed some scar fading with this product. I think it's likely that overall healthier skin can better repair itself.I'm in the process of ordering another jar (my 7th, I think) in enough time that I know I won't run out between. According to Amazon, it's been almost 3 months since my previous order. Given that I sometimes use this more than once a day, I'm pretty impressed with how long a jar lasts and at under $15 per jar, I think this cream is a total steal. The product formulation, as well as the packaging has changed. I loved the original formula. The consistency, the smell, the way it felt on my skin. This is nothing like it and I won’t be buying it again. This is very disappointing as I had been using this for years. I had been using Proactiv green tea moisturizer for years out of fear that I would break out horribly if I switched to anything else. It had really gotten to the point where it wasn't even doing anything anymore for me though.I had flaky, beyond dry skin across my brow bone and under my eyes at times, to the point where it was painful. I tried coconut oil, mango butter, Burt's Bees eye cream, and nothing seemed to work without making it burn like crazy or make it worse.In comes this lovely product. It is super thick, and you only need a tiny bit of it. I just touch the top of it and get enough for above my eyes, then do one more pat for my forehead and each cheek. I use it day and night and it is a miracle product.It is extremely moisturizing, but not to the point of making this skin feel like it is suffocating or greasy. It really just feels balanced and soft and happy. I also use this on my neck where I have some stubborn eczema, and even with the strong fragrance in it, it doesn't bother it and is actually the only thing that has worked on it, even beyond Cortizone-10 for eczema and my Eucerin cream.Yes, the smell is something else. It smells kind of like men's deodorant. I actually almost pitched it/gave it away after using it the first time... I had to wash it off my face because I couldn't stand it. But then, one night, I had it sitting on my counter, and was desperate for some moisture, so I slathered it on around my eyes and woke up with normal skin for the first time since probably October. I have to admit I had some weird dreams that night that my face was inside a guy's armpit. But now, I'm used to it. Just like any perfume you wear, you'll get used to it and not even notice it after a day or two.Oh, and not a single breakout! For this price, you have to give it a try!"
335,B000XFFW64,"I only apply once or twice a day, but I don't use most of my other products anymore as a result of the effectiveness of this one cream. Instructions say to apply six times per day, but I find that to be excessive in my case.Gave my wife a rash, though. It was for her, so this is obviously a no-go. After a full year of use, I felt it was time to add my review! This is literally the only skincare product I use. I wash my face with water and remove eye makeup with a magic mitt in the AM. Then I warm up a pea size amount of this beauty cream in my hands and press it into my damp skin.I have sensitive skin, and used to suffer with breakouts in years past when I used cleansers, toners, etc. This cream has never once caused me to break out. My skin is clear and I don’t feel the need to wear anything beyond eye makeup.A little goes a long way, which makes this jar last a long time. It absorbs quickly and moisturizes perfectly. I’m in my 30’s, and I feel that this cream is rich enough, yet light enough, to address my moisturizing needs.I have never refrigerated mine, and it has never gone bad.I have no desire to try any other product, and I will continue buying this as long as it’s out there.I bought my first jar of this based on the numerous glowing reviews here on Amazon, and I was not disappointed!! If you’re on the fence, try it! And remember, only a small amount is needed! Thick, moisturizing, and makes my skin happy, instantly. A little goes a long way. Great for use at bedtime, but can be used in the morning as well. I'm not as fond of the fragrance, but can deal with it knowing that nothing in it is artificial.Due to the thickness, the cream will spread easier if it is slightly warmed up on the back of the hand or palm for a moment before blending onto the face. I recommend dabbing it over several spots, then blending in, rather than putting it in one spot and trying to spread it all over.How I came to purchasing this item:I have long ago given up typical commercial products, especially in terms of personal care and hygiene. The list of chemicals is often a paragraph or two long, with ingredients that are considered highly toxic. I'm keen on looking for and using ingredients that are organic, natural, and rate low on toxins. In this pursuit, I have come to make my own all natural, non toxic face creams and other personal care products. My formulations use healthy oils, herbs, essential and oils. Most turn out great, some won't be replicated, but at least I know what is going into the formulation. I'm healthier and happier for this. However, I came across this product when searching for tooth powders (I wanted to try making another type of toothpaste). This company came up in search results. While I didn't purchase Christophers tooth powder, I was intrigued by the other products, especially the face cream. It has very few ingredients, and what it does have I know what they are and what they do. I didn't see anything that was too concerning, and was curious how the product worked in comparison to some of mine. It would be nice to have the option to easily buy something than to always make my own and hope it turns out the same way each time. I ordered the product and began using it right away. I am glad I did, as my skin reacts well with it. Fresh, healthy, hydrated skin! I will buy again. This stuff is amazing! Now make a body lotion So this might have been my fault—I think I probably reached into the jar with slightly wet hands after washing my face. I opened it a week later and it had black mold growing in it. Prior to that, it did seem very good for the skin, though it’s not the best (but not the worst) smell due to the ingredients. Since it has natural ingredients maybe that’s why the water made it mold. Maybe use a little spoon to scoop it out. Don’t be like me lol. Either way, I liked it for my chin which has dry skin and acne. It seemed to help heal. I didn’t love it as my overall face and cheek cream. Just personal preference I guess. I have Discoid Lupus and have sores over my nose, cheeks and side of my face. This cream has been so helpful to ease dryness, itchiness, irritation and heal scarring. Thank you for making a great product! So I’m a huge fan of Dr. Christopher products so I had to try this. I bought it and used the entire jar. I thought it was ok but it wasn’t making a drastic difference to my face so when it was almost gone I didn’t reorder and thought I’d try something new. Well, the second it was gone I regretted not reordering. My face was so dry without it and I started breaking out and I missed it so much I quickly bought another jar and will definitely not go without it again! It’s the only thing I use morning and night and it leaves a nice glow on your face all day. Love it!"
336,B001GIOW3G,"SO, I typically like the Cetaphil brands and recently purchased the Oil-Free with SPF35 face moisturizing lotion. The one thing I cannot stand with moisturizers that contain the added layer of SPF protection is if you can smell the SPF protectant. It has a unique and offensive smell to me. I was SO happy to discover that this does NOT have an offensive smell at all. I can't even tell it has SPF in it, so this is EXCELLENT news for my face which by my Dermatologist is required for me to have sun protection more than 30 at all times on my face. The texture is thick and covers well. The only drawback to this is the dispenser. I found it very difficult to prime the first squirt. Actually nearly impossible which I ended up giving up and just taking the top off and applying on my face by dipping the straw tube into the bottle. I had my husband prime it later. It is now primed and the only other drawback is it does not consistently pump, so not sure how long the lotion will be coming out of the tube properly. When it does it is in very small doses. However, does seem to cover well enough even with the minute doses of the small pump action. I did contact Cetaphil to let them know they  need to improve on the dispenser. Other than the functionality issue, I'm VERY pleased with it. Not sure about how long and how well the SPF works, but I'm not using it as a suntan lotion. Not sure how well it works against the sun but I burn easily. So hopefully this will help. I also got it to help moisturize my skin so hopefully that will work as well. I will update if it doesn’t work.  Does have a slight smell to it smells like sunscreen I don’t hate it it’s not overpowering, but there is a scent to it. This order comes in a package of two packagesI got only one and payed for two Me gustó mucho la hidratación que deja a la piel y el plus del protector solar lo hace un producto muy bueno.y práctico. I switched from Olay to this brand when I needed something for more sensitive skin.  I love it! Great product! No white colour of the product seen on the skin Un poco grasosa. Pará mí piel Clumpy!"
337,B0002Z81O0,"These helped clear my daughters skin so much.  Whiteheads have been reduced and a smoother overall appearance.  I do have to remind m daughter regularly to use her skincare routine/products - but this has made more impact than any other product she is currently using.  Everyone tolerates products differently, so some people may want to use every other day.  We found every night before bed works best for my daughter.  Once dry she applies a light weight moisturizer.  So happy with the results. Helped relieve self consciousness and anxiety over skin/acne. Works great and almost immediately. Does have a scent but not over powering. Smells like grapefruit. Extreme. Not for everyday use I got the pads along with the face wash and WOW. I’ve been struggling with hormonal acne around my chin and nose these past few months as I approach 30 years in age. I tried various different products and even that blue light wand but nothing worked. Within a week of using this product I saw results. It’s been only 2 weeks now but my skin feels good and no new breakouts The toner I had been using was discontinued so was searching for a replacement.  On top of that, over a year ago  I had a flareup of adult acne so also needed to treat that. I tried Peter Thomas Roth's Max Complexion Correction Pads (after using several other brands) and they are now my go to toner!  The scent is nice and pads make application very easy.  I use daily as part of my nighttime routine.  It has not only helped clear up my skin, but I continue to use nightly (I have not had any skin sensitivity to the product). I absolutely love these exfoliating pads. They are holy grail for me and the absolute only product I have found that keeps my skin clear (believe me, I've tried them all). Before using these I had terrible breakouts and even when those cleared up I could never get rid of all the little clogged pores/whiteheads on my cheeks. These have not only helped prevent breakouts, but finally rid me of all the clogged pores I had! I still get the occasional hormonal breakout but these clear that up really quick. For the first time in my life I have clear skin. I'm also 27 so my skin is starting to show some signs of aging and I feel like these are helping with that as well.They are pretty strong so I recommend starting slow, using them a couple times a week and then working up. The acids in them can make you sensitive to the sun and they do contain alcohol so they can be a bit drying - definitely better to use them at night then follow up with a good moisturizer (I use the CeraVe moisturizing cream). My skin, although sensitive, tolerates acids really well so I use these every other night (or sometimes every night if I'm trying to clear up a breakout). Never had any issues with them causing irritation, although everyone is different.My only big complaint is the price. These used to retail for around $30 (and I could sometimes find them for $25  here on amazon!). They are now $46 no matter where you buy them....thats a 50% increase in price!!! That's overpriced in my opinion but I continue to buy them because I can't find a cheaper alternative that works as well. I cut them in half, which makes the jar stretch a little longer, but I wish they were more affordable. Its starting to clear up my acne, still present after about using consistently for a month.How many more will I need to use? 🥲 I'm 28 and have struggled with moderate persistent acne since I was a teenager. I've tried many, many different brands and types of treatment, from Proactiv to Neutrogena Skin ID and Active Naturals to Mary Kay and Biore and Clean&Clear, to home remedies, epsom salt, regular old soap, salycilic acid peels, masks, toners, just leaving my skin alone...  Basically I had nothing to lose by trying these too.  And I've been so surprised.I've been using these pads for about 4 months now and the improvement in my skin is amazing.  Is it perfect? No, but I would say it's like 90% better than it used to be.  I still get a zit here and there but they just don't last like they used to and they don't multiply.  This is just one of the 3 cleansing/treatment products I use in my routine that finally seems to be working, but I think it's the most vital.I use them once a day at night after showering and washing/exfoliating my skin with African Black Soap.  They can REALLY sting if you have inflamed/irritated areas on your face, but it passes after a few seconds and it's so worth the discomfort.  The smell is very strong but it's pleasant enough.  And for me, they seem to rebalance my skin after the slightly drying effect of the black soap.  There's no flaking afterwards, and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels smooth and hydrated.I'm able to wear less and less foundation (which finding the right foundation that wouldn't break me out was half the battle I think. I had read that mineral makeup is healthier for the skin but powder foundations just don't work for me so I've been using a liquid mineral foundation"
338,B000NSTX20,"I really like this product, I have bought in store. The bottle I got however was dried out. This used to be an excellent product, with real results. Now the cap get stuck and breaks off, the product is sticky, and cakes up. I was the best Now it just doesn't work. I have ordered 3 separate times. I gave up. Why if you have a good product won't you just leave it alone? Or stop skimping on the ingredients. Take a look at the old established products.  They keep the same quality. SHAME ON YOU. Love this stuff. A lot stickier than I remember but mix a little water and it turns fines lines smooth. Too much can cause wrinkling and flaking. Use just a small drop in a small area and it will work This ""under-eye firming serum"" does tighten up the skin under the eyes.However, it's not practical to use with make-up, though the directions do say that you can mix it with foundation before you put it on. The problem is, I usually first use a cover-up, and then foundation, and whatever I use, it needs to be blended.  Once the firming serum is on, you can't move until it's dry and once it's dry, you can't put anything over it.If you don't wear make-up and you want some under-eye tightening, you might like this.Oh, one other thing.  The bottle I received was only half full. I have used this product for years and love it!  The way I do it, to avoid the extreme pulling effect and the white residue that often results:  I slightly wet my finger and place a drop of the serum on that finger and then pat it below my eye.  Repeat process for the other eye and then let dry for 2 or 3 minutes.  Then I take a damp wash cloth and pat over each application.  That reduces the tightness and removes any residue.  Since I don't ever use foundation I have never used it as directed on the box.  Last year I so very accidentally impaled myself right under my left eye with a tomato stake and had to rush to the emergency room where instead of stitches they used surgical skin glue and when the wound healed it left a little puffy scar under my eye..........I use Sudden Change Under Eye Firming Serum everyday before leaving the house and it smooths out that puff and makes my eye look normal.  Of course, the puff comes back whenever I was my face, but this serum is a game changer for me!  As I said, I have used this for years to tone down the normal puffiness I have under each eye (I am 76 years old, by the way.,....) but now with my ""Tomato scar"" it is an absolute necessity!  (I was honestly thinking of plastic surgery to try to remove the scar but since it's in that delicate tissue right below my eye the surgeon said it could result in a scar much more noticeable then the puffy one that is currently there........so, rather than surgery, I use Sudden Change every day as a part of my morning routine. the product does what it says it is going to do but the after effect is where it is a no,no dark and chaff The product really works however, there is a major design flaw. After a few days the product hardens around the inside of the plunger thingy and then when you twist it off it breaks and jams the opening, and it's glass so not good. Then it's hard to get the product out and I had to use a tool which made it break off and cause more of a mess.  But other than that I love the product!"
339,B000F7UUHQ,"*drinks shotglass of Miracle II* Amen!Ok, I haven't really drank this soap, although I have heard that some people drink the neutralizer which this is based on.It is sort of unclear what exactly is in this soap. The green color is very strange and it's claimed to be from seaweed although this is not an ingredient.I can confirm from personal experience that this does have antimicrobial effects, most likely due to some form oxygenation, which is what the maker implies, along with a bunch of other esoteric stuff. However how exactly this works and the exact ingredients are not revealed as I guess it's a trade secret. Despite this it seems to have very basic and natural ingredients. It does not sting on delicate areas and I have used it to bathe my pets with no ill effects, to the contrary they had better skin and fur after.Even if you're not strictly looking for a soap if you need the antimicrobial effects this offers other great benefits. It is incredibly moisturizing. In the past I had used in shower moisturizers after applying soap but I couldn't find any natural versions of that which were cost effective. It also works unbeilvably well as a cleaner. In this case you will probably want to buy the normal non foaming version but the foam is minimal anyway.You can buy this soap by the gallon to replace everything. Yeah, people say that about Dr. Bronners, but that stuff is harsh! It stings if you get it your eyes and it strips the moisture from your skin! Plus, go ahead and test to see if Dr Bronners or your dish soap can do this.Eat some pasta with marinara and leave the red sauce and bits of the pasta on the plate to dry up. With normal dish soap you would have to scrub to get this off and soak it. I found out that just by putting pure Miracle II on a paper towel allowed me to wipe the plate clean. With Dish Soap or Dr Bronners you would just have some of the dried up stuff broken off and moving around but this actually breaks it down enough that it can all be wiped off without any extra scrubbing or elbow grease.I have been able to clean off surfaces in gross areas like near my litter box or trash can in ways that other soaps, de greasers, and products could not. I don't know if it is just the antimicrobial action but it seems to break oily things down as well and act as a degreaser. I used this once as a laundry soap and now I'm hooked - it removed grease and odors from things that I had pretty much given up on.I got this as a gift for my friend and told her to try cleaning the bathroom with it. She thought it was a joke but was actually really surprised.Would love to see someone with more equipment do comprehensive testing on the scope of this stuff as to its antimicrobial action and breaking down oils. It works so well you get kind of scared that it may have some secret toxic ingredient in it but I really don't think so. This is truly a MIRACLE SOAP, you can utilize this for just about anything that needs to be cleaned, it is amazing, been using this soap for over 30 yrs, thank you! Tried due to all the reviews.It worked as intended but not really my first choice. If you don't believe in miracles just know that this soap has a little magic in it. I enhance mine with colloidal silver or copper water and a few drops of Lugol's iodine. Great and wholesome cleanser for the entire body. For acute problems, Leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing. I'm not a big fan of the moisturizing soap compared to the original formula. It separates in the bottle, must shake before using. 15 years ago my Mother had bought me a gallon of miracle soap, there was a pamphlet that came with it describing its many uses.  One suggestion was to add a wee bit to your gas tank (I do not recommend this today on our newer automobile's without the permission from said distributer.)  However at the time I was driving from Wyoming back to Arizona in a 1973 dodge power wagon.  The whole trip was exhausting and I had to pull over five different times on this trip to have a mechanic adjust my holly carburetor.  It would work for awhile and then the elevation would change and we would have to find another mechanic that would not take advantage of a single mother and her teenage daughter.  Driving through Utah and only 8 hours away from home we kept stalling out at every stop light I looked over at my Daughter and told her of the pamphlet I read and that we should give it a try.  I pulled over and added the required amount to a full tank of gas and we both said a prayer.  I kid you not it was a true miracle we witnessed and not once did we stall out again.  My mechanic was over the next day and rebuilt my old holly carburetor for me.  That being said of this product I was so excited to see it on amazon and use it today in my hot tub and lather myself in it.  It has removed splotches of dry skin and leaves me feeling blessed to have found this miracle again.  Thank you and prayers to all.  Oh and I did buy a new vehicle without the holly carb. I have used this product for around 20 years, and love it!  It's the only thing I use to wash my face, and it takes all makeup and mascara off perfectly.  Also great as a body wash in the shower.  I've used it for my delicate hand wash items, and it cleans great, removing any and all stains.  It's also great for cleaning your whole household.  What's not to love? I had the opportunity to try this soap at a friend's house. They buy the gallon size and dilute it with water. Not only do she and her husband bathe and wash their hair with it, they wash their dishes with it too.  They swear by this soap in terms of its simple, natural ingredients (which works well for me because I have sensitive skin so I stopped using commercial soaps 15 years ago), how well it cleans, and how good it feels on the skin (doesn't dry your skin out like the popular organic Castile soaps--which is what I was using at the time and natural shampoos).My first use was washing a sink full of dishes with it (at their home)  and I immediately noticed that not only were the dishes quite clean but my hands didn't feel dry afterwards.So I bought a bottle. The soap was everything they said it was - it was clean-feeling, very minimally scented (I don't like synthetically-perfumed products), and my skin did not feel dried out, but soft.  I also used it on my hair and it worked very well, saving me money in buying both soap and shampoo.  My friends dilute their soap with water because it's concentrated, but I don't. I just use a little which goes a long way.I also tried the moisturizing soap, which was great but you MUST shake it up before each use to integrate the oils with the soap. It's great for very dry skin or during the winter months when the air is dry.So I definitely would recommend this soap!"
340,B000BRSHXE,"Used after cleansing the face for a magnificent feeling! I have tried various face cream, and always come back  to Seba med !!!! I love it a lot Love this moisturizer. Been using it for years already. Doesn’t feel greasy at all. Does the job. Had to return because of the extremely strong scent. All the products including this one have worked great. I like it so well I have bought the face cream, body cream and shampoo as gifts for my daughter and sister. I meet company representatives, she said if you get the product elsewhere most likely aren’t the real thing Sebamed products have become a regular part of her skin care regimen. She swears by these products, their efficacy and value."
341,B000GDA06A,"My favorite face wash - in a great pump top bottle. I use this primarily in the morning - the citrus scent is zippy and helps me feel more awake. Leaves my skin so soft! Love the vitamin C protection too. Excelente producto, lo recomiendo Clean product new Makes my face feel clean and fresh! I am very happy with this product, have been using it for years. I do switch to Juice Beauty products once in awhile.But like murad face scrub for its scent isn’t overwhelming and leaves my skin not dried out but clean. I like this product.Leaves my skin smooth and fresh looking I love how it lightened and brightened my skin, making me smooth, I love the entire Murand Line, I bought the small brightener trial kit and I live it. A little goes a long way, and I have a small face so the kit ladt.me 2.to 3 months..I love it...I look 18...but actually...im older .by a landslide It is a wonderful product for your skin  won’t use anything else"
342,B000OIHHYK,"I have been using this product for almost 30 years and I know it works because no one ever knows just how old I am. I do not wear 'make-up"" because i doon't need to do so. I use this twice a day after shower in the morning and before bed at night. I also use her neck cream. I put it on the face, Works great. It is hard to believe how just a little (I mean little) amount of this serum covers and works so beautifully.  I know by feeling my face if I have used mine.  Not greasy or oily and visually disappears quickly after application.  The serum I received is exactly like the one I had purchased elswhere for a MUCH higher price.  While the size of 2 fluid ounces may not seem that it would last very long, it really does if you don't over apply.  You will find out very early how little you have to use for great results.  I felt fully compensated buying at the higher price since it lasted so long and now I am super happy to have found it at a better price.Using this gives my skin a much softer feel that is really hard to explain.  It is just softer with no dry feeling or pulling.  Depending on what is going on, I may or may not use another moisturizer before applying any make-up.  On days that I'm not going to be wearing make-up, I just use this and some mascara and a brush on sunscreen and I'm good to go.  Might help you to know that I turned 62 this year so I have aging skin and it still works and no one believes I am as old as I am.  Had I started using this on my younger face maybe my skin could have looked as great as Dr. Denese's.  She is the best advertizement for her products. This is a fantastic product that truly hydrates the skin. It is advertised to moisturize and it does just that - I follow the directions to let it penetrate the skin for 5 to 7 minutes, then apply my eye cream and facial moisturizer. I can really notice a difference in the overall hydration of my skin, especially in my eye area, thus less visible wrinkles.  I like that it is recommended for the eye area, unlike many other products that say to avoid the eye area.  It is super rich, and I had a few break outs in the beginning when I got it too close to the sides of my nose and mouth/chin area.  I solved this by focusing on eye, cheek and chin (just as the directions say!) I purchased this on May 5 and today is August 6 and I just used the very last drop after using it morning and night every day for three months - so it lasts pretty well This is in part, I think, because it is very liquid and not thick like some other products, like Olay Regenerating Serum, which is also highly rated but to me, not nearly as effective.  I am still experimenting with other, lower-priced serums - Olay Regenerating and Burt's Bees - neither of which come close to Dr. Denese, so I do plan to reorder in the near future. I would absolutely recommend this product and do not hesitate to rate it with 5 stars! I have very dry skin, using this serum my face has not been dry since I have been using this product for over 5 years. It’s the best and works wonders on your face. I am 68 yrs old with barely any wrinkles due to this serum Love this serum as it moisturizers and firms very nice.  Love Dr. Denese products.  Prices are really good on Amazon..  I use to buy from QVC but never again as the prices are so much better here.  Just try this product and if not satisfied, I am sure they will let you return.  But once you try you will be hooked...  Sinks right into the skin and becomes a matte form after a few minutes..  I use the firming pads first and then the serum and what a nice combo.  The orange peel is awesome to, which you can use once a week or when needed.. She has nice products that work.. I have tried so so so many products and this line so far is the best I have used.  I am 62 years young and have tried a lot.... Even Better than the most expensive products like Lancôme, este Lauder, etc. I just ordered the microdermabrasion cream and will review later on after I use it a bit.  Great product line... I reviewed this product after the first purchase, and as I am about to finish the second bottle, I can reconfirm that this is one of the best skin care products I have ever used.  It really soaks in after a few minutes, and enhances the effectiveness of other moisturizers.  I like that it is safe and recommended around the delicate eye area, where I really need moisture but have to be careful not to irritate.  I use it on my forehead, eye area, cheeks and under my chin, and I avoid getting it too near my nose and mouth area, where I had minor breakouts (the directions say just that, so please read them.)  Highly recommended for dry skin. I have finally found my product line.  Dr. Denese products have really helped me.  I have dry skin and my face is much drier in the fall and winter.  If you exfoliate, this is amazing!  it soaks right in, does not clog your pores, and you will see a difference.  I feel like I can easily go without makeup with this.  Combine with a few other products from Dr. Denese, you won't be sorry.  I'm so glad that I gave this brand a try.  And getting it on Amazon gives you amazing pricing.  This product really does moisturize your skin and keeps it that way all day long."
343,B00117CH5M,"Scent Light fresh scent and very moisturizing! I love Naked Bee lotions. They go on feeling smooth and silky but not greasy and are easily absorbed by the skin.Their moisture is long lasting. If applied fresh out of the shower it can last the day. (Mix it with olive oil or another carrier oil and its benefits can last up to two days in my experience! )Most scents, including Orange Blossom, are perfectly balanced and pleasant without being too overpowering. (Note that some fragrances such as Jasmine, as one would expect, are MUCH stronger.)I am allergic to a preservative found in 90-95% of commercially made lotions & soap products. Naked Bee is one of the few lotions that doesn't have it.  Yet Naked Bee holds its consistency and has a great feel.I've paid a lot of money & given or thrown away a lot of products trying to find one that kept my skin moist, had a nice scent, and that I didn't break out in a painful rash from. Naked Bee lotions are very high quality and are the perfect match for me!  They were literally the answer to my prayers. I LOVE THIS HAND LOTION.  I DON'T LIKE THE SCENT OF HONEY WITH ORANGE BLOSSOM.  I WOULD PREFER THE ORANGE BLOSSOM BY IT ITSELF. I use it on my elbows when they seem rough and they clear up ina couple of days. I bought this to give my husband and I a ""Spa Day"".  This decision came after checking with the spa at the hotel we were planning to visit in Vegas and finding out a ""Couple's 1/2 day"" service was going to cost us upwards of $600.  So, I said to h€LL with that!  I'm gonna buy some spa quality products that had an aromatherapy benefit and we'd just give each other the Spa Day!  And it would only cost 1/6th the price for all the products I purchased, including FHF Chocolate Sundae Best Facial (we both loved it), 80 Acres Blood Orange Salt Scrub, 80 Acres Blood Orange Oil and last but not least FHF Honey Heel Glaze.I tried to get products I could get past my Manly Man.This lotion reminded us of the many times we drove by orange groves when they were in blossom.  It's very hard to replicate that heady scent but this lotion does without being overwhelming.You may think that a couple that's 55 years young would have benefitted more from a spa tech doing our Spa Day, BUT we put a date on the calendar to have the same type of 1/2 day together in exactly 4 weeks.  On top of that we have ALL the product we'll need for at least 6-7 ""Home Spa Days""!We had SOOO much fun together.  I was very pleased with having found the right combination of products. I got a Sample of this in with a gift and just had to buy it. I have no idea about if it’s good for sensitive skin but it is rich and creamy and I absolutely love the scent. I will be buying it again. I've written many reviews on different lotions because it is difficult for me to find something I actually like. I'm a guy, and I really only need cream for my face on a really dry winter day, and several times a day on my hands. I can't stand lotions that are too oily... nothing is worse than getting back to your computer, putting lotion on, and then having to wait forever for it to absorb because you don't want to get your keyboard and mouse greasy. This cream is perfect. I can put it on, and within 60 seconds it has absorbed so I can get back to work, leaving my hands nice and soft.The biggest benefit, however, are the ingredients. The more natural the better, and this is great! The orange blossom honey scent is very nice too... only problem is that it reminds me of orange soda, so I get thirsty :)"
344,B000GDDKJ4,"This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee who also used Murad products (this particular toner, she told me, was best for sensitive, oily/acne prone skin). They are much, much gentler than Proactiv, which I had never realized I needed. My acne was so bad and Proactiv never seemed to help - turned out it was just to harsh and my skin reacted badly to it, only making my acne worse. With the help of Murad products my skin is almost completely clear now! I've been using it for years and I couldn't be happier. Now I only need to use this toner twice a day to keep my skin clear. It has a very bracing feel that makes my face feel super clean, and reduces shininess. It may make your face red but as soon as it dries it should calm down! Happens to me, but it is just working its magic and my skin always dries looking healthy and bright. Took a few days for my skin to get used to it but it works like a charm. And, as a bonus - even using it twice a day, a bottle of this lasts for months! It takes very little on a cotton ball. I love this product so much, couldn't recommend it more. quality I love this toner! Keeps my skin clear and feels refreshing. My only complaint is it really dries my skin so I have to use sparingly in winter. A couple months ago I was introduced to using a toner in my daily skin care routine. I first tried the neutrogena one and at the time I thought i liked it. However, it left my skin very tight, as well as a burning sensation, but it did leave my skin nice and clean. I have super sensitive acne-prone skin, and one thing i noticed about the neutrogena toner as well as others i tried, was that it did absolutely nothing for the acne. However, this toner is AMAZING. I just ordered/received my second bottle of it and I could not be more in love with a skin care product. When I use it, it makes my skin feel fresh, clean and amazing. It has a slight cooling effect, not a burning sensation, which feels amazing. Also, I have seen a dramatic decrease in breakout and size of pimples. Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this. Since i love this product so much I decided to order the moisturizer from this brand as well and I am excited to see how it works! I previously used this toner for many years but frankly it’s not worth the money anymore. Sure it’s a decent product, but other equivalent products can be had for half what this costs. This may be partly due to Brandon, but still, it’s too expensive for a pretty basic toner. I have been using murals for years. I use when I start to see my face getting dull, breaking out, and it makes a huge huge difference.When I first got it I used it every day - twice was too much and dried me out, once is ok for me. You have to learn your skin and what works best for you. The toner is my favorite.I recommend this product to anyone I know that has problems with their skin. It really works amazing. I love this toner! I've bought from them 4 times now and never received a counterfeit. The toner is tingly, clean, and perfect! It makes your skin feel a bit tighter, oil free and for a few hours!Some reviewers have commented on it stinging - and it does a little bit. But mostly where you have bad acne or other troublesome spots, which means that it's working to clean out those areas and tighten the pores so dirt doesn't go in!I have sensitive skin and this toner has only ever helped. I've never received extra acne or dry spots from it, and I literally cannot wash my face without using this after. Since implementing this into my skin care regimen, my face has become softer, more even and less acne prone.My system that has kept deep acne away for two years now it: Murad Time Release Acne Cleanser with a Clarisonic Mia 2, Murad Clarifying Toner, and Obagi Therapeutic Lotion for spot treatment. I swear by this routine and love all 4 of those products!I highly recommend this! Already bought my second bottle & im not even done with the first one! I love it so much I don’t wanna risk running out of it! Does have a stronger scent to it & can make your face tingle but that means it’s working! My face feels squeaky clean after using this product."
345,B00080DK86,"I like the added benefit of the glycolic pads prior to using the cream. I wish they were thicker. The pads fold over themselves and kind of squish between my fingers because they are so thin. I want to start off by saying if you have never used glycolic acid before please do not buy this. You need to get your skin used to it before you use this 20%. You will have some pretty severe breakouts and sensitivity otherwise. If you have used glycolic acid before then I think this will work well for you. This is not the usual brand I buy but the one I prefer was unavailable at the time I needed it. To start with the pads, unlike what I usually use, are not textured in anyway. I liked having the texture because I feel like it adds a little bit of exfoliation. Even though these pads are untextured I do feel like they covered my full face using just one. One con is that these pads and the container in general are not very wet. These are damp and there is nothing in the bottom of the container for them to continue soaking up the solution. I haven't reached the bottom of these yet but I am concerned they will be too dry when I get to the last few pads. My skin does feel very soft and smooth the next day after I use them so I do not doubt the strength of the acid. I really believe that these are 20%.There is one thing about these pads that other brands do not have that you should be aware of. I usually read all the ingredients before I buy a skin care product. Somehow I missed it on Amazon that these pads contain menthol in the ingredient list. When you put a pad on your face you can instantly feel the cold from the menthol. At first I didn't mind because it makes the stinging from the acid less. After a few uses the mint was overpowering and my face felt like it was burning for about 10 minutes after putting the acid on. If you are someone that loves menthol in your products, like I used to be, then I think you will love these. I on the other hand have moved away from products containing menthol.Overall these aren't terrible but they were just not a good enough substitute for my preferred acid peel. I use these every three days and use retin-A the other days. Follow up with either a gel moisturizer or some rosehip oil about an hour after using these to prevent any flaking or dryness the next day. I usually wait an hour just to make sure the acid has had time to work but if you have sensitive skin you may want to either wash the solution off after 10-20 minutes or put moisturizer on soon after applying this. Also for any of you wondering, I strongly recommend the Touch brand of 20% glycolic acid pads if you want something without menthol. If you are ok with the cooling after then stick with these.  I knocked off one star for the menthol and one for the fact that the pads are on the drier side. If you do not currently use any acids in your skincare routine then start with the 10% and work your way up slowly. I use a lot of acids in my routine and I know what my skin can take so I went with 20%. Also if you use retinols you will want to discontinue use as they will react with one another. It’s been over a month now and I am seeing visible changes with discoloration, pore size, breakouts (especially hormonal), wrinkles and an overall better product absorption. I use a hydrating serum after, a hydrating mask and a rich cream but you can find what works for you. I will be buying more when I run out and LOVE this product. This product is the BEST!! I have sensitive skin, which has been scarred by acne. While I no longer breakout, I still have the unsightly scars. Well, I did, until I began using these pads once a day. They not only make your skin feel smooth as butter, they've managed to get rid of my dark marks far faster than using the expensive department store products.Some people on here say that it's made their pores smaller. This hasn't been my experience. My pores aren't larger, they just aren't any smaller. Perhaps, I should start using the pads less? I have sensitive skin and over exfoliation can make your pores inflamed, which make them larger.This treatment will burn a bit upon initial application after you've been using it for awhile. It's only temporary. If you don't feel as though you can handle the tingle, don't use the pads everyday.***KEEP AWAY FROM YOUR EYES*** I read someone say that it made their wrinkles/fine lines fade... I rubbed a pad on my under eye area for 2 days and by the third, I had a NEW fold under my eyes! I'm in my twenties and only had 1 barely visible line before. I stopped using it under my eyes  and about 4 days later, my eye area was normal again. Glycolix Elite makes products for your eyes and if you're actually having wrinkle issues, I'd suggest those as this product is too strong to be used on your sensitive eye area... especially if you already have sensitive skin like moi.Using these pads have given me so much confidence that I don't have to fret about slathering on concealer and foundation before being seen in public! They've also saving me the expense of going to the dermatologist to have laser treatments on my face and neck to remove those spots.When I first started using the pads, I used them twice a day (mornings and nights) for about 5 days. Then, 2x a day was unbearable and I changed to only applying at night, before bed.I deducted a star because this is my 3rd jar of these pads and I cannot seem to figure out a way to keep them from getting mold/mildew on the inner cap. They remain upright in a dry cabinet, yet the cardboard liner in the jar's lid soaks up the product on the pads. I tried to resolve this issue by cutting a piece of foil and inserting it in the cap, but that's when the mildew came. I had all of the ""treatment"" still in my pads, but a cap with mildew. Eww."
346,B00174GJC6,"I ordered this soap, not to get white but to exfoliate the dead skin, and even my skin tone. I use it over my entire body, skipping my private area. DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR VAGINA. Someone who isn't me learned this lesson the hard way, once. Lol.This soap is great. I order it often. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. It does the job. I am a light brown black woman, and I did notice I got a couple of shades lighter, which I hadn't intended but can't complain since the soap evened my tone and I looked fresh and maybe a couple of years younger. It's a nice soap to use a couple of times a week.This probably is to be expected and a moot point, but if you leave the soap on your skin too long it will burn, boy leaving any scarring but you'll feel it begin to irritate. Also, I've noticed when using the soap more frequently my skin seems thinner. The scent is not too harsh. It's excellent for removing dark spots on elbows and knees and I imagine any other place. It is yet gentle enough for the face, where the spots are removed as well. You have to leave the foam on the affected area for a minute or two and voila! My holy grail for years. I just wish it wasn't so pricey but I guess if you want the results you gotta pay the price....and I would. Time and time again.  Haven't seen much of difference but it cleans well and smells really nice . The price could be a Lil cheaper. But overall I love this product. So I first tried this soap in Ireland but it felt stingy and rough combined with the cold and stingy weather there. But now living in New York with so much grime in the air and subways and humid trash, you get the point. I found never really feel clean after a shower,then I remembered this soap.. I'm so glad I did. It is hard to find an all natural soap that also deeply exfoliates like this one. I feel much deeper clean after a shower now but I always have to follow up with some castor oil or lotion after because it is drying for my skin. I'm mixed race if that helps,caramel tone, attached photo hope helps bc everyone will have different reaction. I don't get a huge noticeable difference in skin lightening with this. But that wasn't my purpose. I also don't use it on my face bc it is too sensitive for how harsh the apricot pieces can be against the tender eye and cheek area. I have put some of the suds on my clarisonic with the cashmere brush top and used it on my face that way when I need to cut through oil and it's much more gentler. Thank you for a quality product that is sometimes hard to find. (The orange colored soap from the same brand is usually stocked in stores near me, it is gentler on the skin but I don't feel that my skin is breathing like I do after this one).  The only con is the price tag but in this instance, (i can't get to the spa like I used to  for the steam rooms ect to flush my skin, ) so I think it isn't too bad considering how you don't need to use alot because it suds well and feeling a deep clean,naturally, is priceless. This soap works great on dark spots, oily  and rough skin. After washing with the soap, it makes the skin feel super dry. You will definitely need a good moisturizer after each use.This is not for people with sensitive skin. The exfoliating beads are very rough on the skin but I love for my oily tough skin. I am not being paid to leave this review!& I LOVE THIS SOAP! I had a really bad reaction to something and it left horrible scars on my shoulders and face! This soap cleared it up in a few weeks! I will buy this soap for the rest of my life! I was using Kojic and switched to this it works way better!"
347,B000NW4I7G,"Im so happy to find these on Amazon. I 1st purchased this and another scent at a local shop where i live and my 22 year old daughter and I absolutely loved the scent. Try it, you wont be disappointed... I have ordered this twice.  Beautiful scentvand by far my favorite. Definitely recommend and I will continue to purchase.  I honestly have nothing negative to say about this product. Nice aroma.  I like, but not love it. I don't love this scent and find it doesn't last long at all. My husband said ""it smells like an old lady"" :-( Most ppl are buying this because they seen the ads on one media platform or another.Will it attract men the way the add depicted, imo no. But the smell of some of these is absolutely amazing and last long. So if you're looking for a good sent. Yes, but if you're trying to attract the opposite gender (men/women) I'm not super confident in that.The key is, love yourself. Walk head up and take care of you! Because when you love you, you'll attract what's for you! Love this scent! On me its got sort of a powdery scent with hints of musk! Lots of compliments Great smell!! I was skeptical, but kept going back to Love!Here to say, I’m so glad I did! I love the LOVE!"
348,B001GIOV8C,"This is a great night cream. In the morning I wake up with almost a glow. It is a great product for my skin (olive toned, combination type). I have also noticed a subtle change in the freckles on the top of my cheek bones from sun exposure- they have become lighter and more faint. I will continue to use this product because I see results. The only downside is that the cream can be very greasy if you use too much. So you have to use only a little and spread it over your face, neck, and hands.I think the thing I am most impressed with is when I used this cream to treat a fresh burn mark. I work at a restaurant and burned myself pretty well. I knew it would scar because I have burn marks on my arms and hand that all happened the same way and they all left nice dark brown scars. I put this cream on the night of the burn because I figured it was more or less a natural product and since it was an ""ageless night creme"" that it would help renew the cells that were burnt so that it would heal faster. Well it instantly helped relieve some of the stinging from the burn and after using it for a couple days (once or twice a day) I noticed that the burn was healing great compared to other burns I previously had. Well to make this short, after using this product continuously until the burn was healed, the burn DID NOT EVEN leave a scar!!! This was such a welcomed surprise that this night creme prevented the scarring, I can not even express how pleased I am with this product.(Side note: I would be careful using this as a burn treater if you have sensitive skin).Anyway I love the results, including the unexpected one, from using this Burts Bees product. I will definitely be repurchasing!! I have been using this night cream for 2 years and it is thick, creamy and soaks in without any oily residue.  I REALLY love this stuff.In my 20's I used to use Clinique. You know that yellow hydrating cream - which I didn't need, because I had youth on my side and my face was a bit oily.  In the winter though, it worked nicely, but it clogged my pores and I broke out a lot.  So I went a lot of my teens and 20's sans moisturizer.In my 30's I was going through all those good hormone changes yet again and my face became much more oily, and along with that oil, came breakouts too so once again, I relied on the natural oils in my face to moisturize.  Sans moisturizer.Now that I have turned 40, I have noticed a change in my skin.  I am developing a couple of small age spots, and dry patches.  I wash with a soap with salicylic acid that keeps those great hormone breakouts down a bit, but this cream and the day cream has actually changed the texture of my skin.This one in particular I use at night.  After washing my face feels a bit tight and dry.  I slather on a finger-full of this cream and my face feels soft, supple and dewy.  Never oily.  It actually soaks in to my skin - it doesn't just sit on top like many slimy thick creams.  It smells fresh and herbal which is nice.  No fake fragrance in this stuff.  In the morning, my face feels smooth, not oily, not dry.  My wrinkles have diminished a bit, and the freshness has returned.I LOVE this cream.  Highly recommend. I have been using Burt's Bees Ageless Night Creme for about 3 years, and it WAS the best night creme I had used.However, this is no longer true, because it is not the same product anymore.Recently, I purchased a new jar through Amazon, and was very disappointed to discover that the product has changed. The feel of it, the smell-- everything is different from the product that I know and love. It is greasy, it smells bad-- it feels cheap. I no longer wake up with my skin feeling improved. The new formula is not a product I would recommend.Most of all, I am saddened to discover that a product I have grown to love no longer seems to exist, without warning. But I also feel I was tricked into buying a product that is nothing like the product it was packaged to look like.I am curious why this product has changed, but I have a feeling that if I knew the reasons, it would be upsetting--since I doubt the goal of Burts Bee's was to make the customer happier with this change. I have become a skeptic of this brand ever since it was bought out by Clorox, and now I see that this was with good reason.I have contacted Customer Service in hopes for a replacement product (I'd like them to send me the old formula I thought I purchased), or if that is not possible, a refund. If I experience satisfactory customer service, I will update my review.I am also curious to see if this review will be posted on their company website, since I noticed there are no reviews of the Ageless Night Cream currently listed that are recent. I believe the newest one is from 2012, which would have been a review of the original formula.Very sneaky, Burt's Bees. Not cool at all.----2/10/14 Update-- After emailing Burt's Bees, they did issue me a refund.----3/24/14 Update-- I just want to point out that my review submitted to the Burt's Bees website was never made public. It seems they screen reviews and only publish positive ones. So sneaky, so dishonest. Look for yourself. [...]"
349,B000052YJM,"At the time of purchase I was breaking out and decided to try this. I would say it did work, but would use only during a break out as it has meds in it for acne. Once the break out was gone it left my skin dry and flaky. I am going to keep it in case of another break out, but that will be the only time I use it. This cream is great for sensitive skinned people and it has no scent. I’ve been using this for years and love it. Tried some higher end face lotions recently and they made my face break out and burn/itch. This is by far the best and my skin stays soft and clear. Also, it has a very light, clean scent. I’m highly sensitive to too much sent and this is perfect. 👍 I'm onto my second bottle of this. I LOVE this stuff. I LOVE IT. I have very sensitive oily skin, but then the apples of my cheeks are really dry. I have tried for years to find any kind of moisturizer that didn't clog my pours and cause breakouts. This is it. It hasn't caused a single breakout on my skin. I wash my face and after drying, use a couple dots of this afterward. Controls the oil all day, and keeps my cheeks happy. Used before I don't usually suffer from severe acne but I occasionally get a spot or two one my face but recently, I got a cluster of bumps on my forehead and decided to try out this cream to see if it would help reduce them (since it does contain salicylic acid). Overall, I do notice that there are getting less and less bumps on my forehead.The only disadvantage I feel this cream has, is that it is slightly drying. This is because after using it on a regular basis on my forehead, I've noticed that now when I raise my eyebrows, I have several creases on my forehead that never use to exist there before I started using this cream. When I switch back to using a different moisturizer on my forehead, the lines/creases aren't there when I raise my eyebrows so I believe it is this cream is causing my skin to dry out and crease. Also salicylic acid is known to dry out skin.Overall, I would recommend this product because it does help, but I would suggest using another moisturizer after applying this cream to help keep your skin in a good condition. This is great for combo skin - dry in some areas and acne-prone in others. Feels a bit tingly which I like. I use this before applying makeup and it works well for that."
350,B000052YMT,"My search for non-soap face wash led me to this product a few months ago. My initial search results got me to try a few (expensive) products from L'Occitane, the Shea Butter face scrub and another exfoliator wash.  Both are great products and worked well for me in terms of less drying skin.  However I don't think I need to scrub/exfoliate everyday.  Cetaphil came up in the following research.  I figure for less than $10 (I got one at a local drug store first), I can afford to experiment.  It turned out to be the best dollar I've spent on personal care product.  It works so great in cleaning and smoothing the skin, restoring natural softness and controlling breakout.  I am not even using the L'occitane products that much any more and definitely not going back to those soapy face washes.If you are interested in this product - get a smaller bottle at your local story, try it and you can see whether this works for you or not.  It's very worthwhile trying it! I love this cleanser. My dermatologist recommended it because it is safe even for sensitive or problem skin. After it arrived and I read the directions, I realized that it can be used even without water...just tissue it off. It is so gentle in fact that the directions recommend that when using water, you do not rinse completely, but instead leave some of it, which then acts as a moisturizer. Gentle, effective facial cleaner.  I keep it in the shower for daily morning use.  Not harsh, so great for my sensitive skin.  At night, I use a difference cleanser for makeup. Finally, I found something that words nicely on my skin, keeps it soft aftercleansing and works on those stubborn blackheads. This works great, and althoughit is more expensive than some facial cleansers, I would recommend it to anyone who is wantingto hone in on those problem areas. This cleanser is gentle on sensitive skin, economical, and a little goes a long way. A four-ounce bottle can last you for a week if you use it once a day. I have very sensitive dry skin, and this GENTLE face cleanser works great on my skin. It makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. I would recommend this item! I've been battling acne for years now and this is the best face wash that i've ever used so far. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find.  I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This 4 oz side is perfect to throw in your gym bag or overnight suitcase."
351,B000HGIQRG,"I had used another unscented sensitive soap for probably 10 years. I panicked when they stopped making it and tried all kinds of other brands. Everything seemed to make my skin dry and itchy. I am so glad that I found this one. If I have any complaint, it is that the bars do not last as long as they should, but they do come in a pack of six, so I have them on a scheduled delivery. This is my second order of 6 bars.  It is non irritating, non drying and no perfumes.  I have ultra sensitive skin.  I find that it calms my facial skin.  It lathers nicely, which I think helps clean the pores.  I travel with a bar.  I gift this soap.  Forget all the special scents - put a bow on it!  For men too! I love Basis soap but it's very difficult for me to find in stores so I usually end up ordering from Amazon.  This is the only soap I use because I have very sensitive skin and have struggled with the perfumes in other soaps causing issues with my body.  A dermatologist recommended that I try out Basis and I've never looked back at any other soap on the market! It's just as the name states....Basic! No added perfumes or other junk that most soaps have mixed in to them.  It doesn't have a very strong scent, which if you're using this soap you probably aren't looking for anything that has a strong odor anyway. I think it's pretty good for dry skin as well, I've actually used this on my 2 year old since he has eczema and his skin tends to break out with bumps sometimes....well it's even helped clear up his skin and I think that speaks volumes! Basis sensitive skin bar soap was recommended by my dermatologist.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I could no longer find this product in the stores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon. I like that the soap is lightly scent, good for sensitive skin, has a nice lather. Purchased for my brother who has sensitive skin.  Very glad I did. Bought this to replace Dial Basics which I can no longer find. It's about the same overall but the bar is much bigger. Good alternative. I have extremely dry skin, so I am very careful with soap. Most soaps dry the skin, but Basis does not. I’ve used this soap for decades, after my dermatologist recommended it. I no longer feel like I have to scratch my skin off. It isn’t perfect, but a huge improvement."
352,B000P9B3O8,"I use this after showering to sooth and moisturize my aged and dried skin. The nicest part about this product is the shea butter which makes it just glide onto your skin. Someone had bought me very expensive Loctaine lotion with shea butter which worked great except it was extremely expensive. So I decided to try the Jergans and wow it’s just as good if not better because the Jergens doesn’t have much scent. If you have dry itchy skin you need to buy this product - you won’t be disappointed. My skin feels better and the smell is great I love this lotion and use it daily, however, I was supposed to get 3 bottles and only received one. I try to save money where I can and paying $10 for one bottle is not it. I am very disappointed with this seller and will not buy from them again. The only moisturizer I use anymore. Easy to use, takes less time. And moisturizes skin without feeling heavy or greasy! This is a heavy but not greasy lotion, lightly naturally scented. Shea is the superior moisturizer in the first place, and this is the best shea I've found. We use it with my elderly mother who gets itchy without fairly frequent use, and gets skin tears. I use it at home also, and have had troubles with my fingernails breaking and splitting--much less now with frequent use on my hands. It's thick and nice. I also buy scented shea and sometimes we use that for mom to enjoy the scent, but I do the rest of her with this because it's just so much thicker and better. I recently tried Jergens Wet Skin Body Moisturizer with Shea Butter Oil and I am extremely impressed with the results. I have always struggled to find a body moisturizer that is both effective and convenient to use, but this product ticks all the boxes. The wet skin formula is so easy to apply - I just step out of the shower, pat my skin dry and apply the moisturizer directly onto my wet skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and nourished. The shea butter oil adds an extra layer of hydration and the scent is light and refreshing. Overall, I am very happy with this product and will definitely be repurchasing it in the future. This is an easy product to use after a shower or bath. Smooth it on wet skin, wipe the excess off. Leaves your skin extra soft , even for winter dry skin. Smells nice, not too strong. Okay so as someone who uses the tanning bed - this stuff is awesome!!! Obviously I dry my skin out while tanning but since I got this stuff, my skin is as soft as ever. It hardly smells like anything from the bottle but when applying it has a nice soft scent. Absolutely recommend!"
353,B001F51TTA,"As I transition into menopause (fun fun!), my skin has become drier and more sensitive. Anything will irritate it.  After two bouts of perioral dermatitis (it is horrendous; treatment is even worse!), I had to become extremely careful about what I put on my face. Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin checks all the boxes! My sensitive skin is well hydrated and ""quiet"". I have not had any redness, itching, etc. from harsh chemicals or scents that usually comes with skin creams. The expensive ones are the worst. I am very happy with my purchase. My skin is too! Olay products never disappoint. Hope this helps someone :-) I am with the others here who love this sensitive skin product. I am not sure what P&G is about in taking this out of stores, but I cannot find it anywhere and even called the company to discover where it went. The woman I spoke to told me to check the dollar stores, which I am too lazy to do -- since Amazon gets me the stuff with a few clicks! Only the SPF 15 sensitive skin lotion is available in the stores I frequent and I don't like the feel of this stuff on my face for everyday use (though it is great  as a light/non-waterproof sunscreen in the summer months and on those vacays that we New Englanders take to sunny places in winter). The regular Oil of Olay is much too perfume-y for my liking. I have been using this stuff since I was a youngster (and that's a long time ago) and it has never engendered a greasy sensation or a rash or a breakout, as other creams seem to do (especially ones containing dimethicone) over time.My one complaint about getting this via Amazon is it seems to be consistently more expensive to buy on Amazon (sometimes $5 to $7 more per bottle) than it was in the stores where I formerly was able to find it. So, that's a drag...But it is also a testament to how important this product is to me that, if I am remembering correctly, I paid (gasp, cough, cough) up to $30 a couple times for a two-pack of it. This the same product I used to buy at my local pharmacy (but they stopped carrying it). I have used this for years at night because it's a light moisturizer that works for my mixed oily/dry skin, and the Sensitive in the name means it's unscented. Works well. I have been using Oil of Olay Beauty Fluid for Sensitive Skin for well over 15 years.  I have dry skin and must moisturize immediately after I shower.  It is non-greasy, absorbs quickly, light, and instantly moisturizes my face.  I never have break-outs or clogged pores (at least not due to this moisturizer.)  I have found other moisturizers to not absorb well, leaving a greasy sheen on my face, or to be too perfumy, or to discolor in the bottle over time.  Additionally I live in a very humid climate and I need moisturizer to absorb instantly, not linger on my skin and soon mix with sweat and have to be wiped off.For some reason you can buy regular Oil of Olay Beauty Fluid in the stores but not the type for Sensitive Skin, so I have to buy this product online.  I prefer the Sensitive Skin version because it has no scent - for some reason my husband doesn't like the scent of regular Oil of Olay. This is a product my sister uses for her sensitive skin.  She has used this beauty fluid for years because it is gentle and fragrance free.  She couldn't find it locally, so we checked Amazon and they had the best deal set up under their subscribe and save program with free shipping (no $25 minimum purchase required).  Since we could cancel the next order any time before it ships, we figured it was worth signing up for the program.My sister found out that this product had been discontinued so she contacted the company to complain and was told by their customer service rep that it is still available.  She thinks the company may have reversed their decision to discontinue the product after receiving numerous complaints.  But we will see if it is available here again in a few months.She can't use the new formulation because the sunscreen additive irritates her skin. For several years, I've had horrible completely dry skin under my eyes.  So, bad that some days it looked like I had been punched in both eyes.  That bad.  I went to the dermatologist and, over the last several years, he prescribed two prescription medications.  The first one was a steroid.  It kind of worked, but the fact that it was a steroid prompted me to ask for something else.  The second medication worked alot better but it came along with bad potential side effects of its own.  And, it looked like I had vaseline under my eyes all the time.  So, just for the heck of it, I tried this product.  Wow.  If I use it every day, and several times a day when my skin is very dry, the symptoms completely go away!  I've had it for a couple months, so I know it works.  So, I'm writing this review... Let me start by saying that I'm 43 years old and haven't really moisturized a day in my life because every moisturizer I've ever tried (and I've tried most of them) breaks out my skin.  I have very sensitive skin that is also very acne prone.  I read all the positive reviews and decided to give the Olay Moisturizing Lotion, Sensitive Skin a try.  My skin isn't overly dry.  I would consider it normal with moderate dryness occuring in the winter months.  This stuff works great!  It moisturized my skin, is not heavy or greasy, and best of all - is the ONLY moisturizer that did not break out my face whatsoever!  I love this stuff!  I highly recommend this for anyone, especially those with super sensitive, acne prone skin. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!  My skin looks and feels so much better!"
354,B000S01TBG,"I love this lotion!  It is a thick lotion but not greasy.  I have been using this lotion for at least 10 yrs. The smell is great as well! The Nag Champ Sandalwood scent is strong and nasty smelling.  I could smell it before I opened the box.  It was not the scent I ordered.  I already have the Orange Blossom scent and was re-ordering because it works great and smells good.  They sent me the Nag Champ scent in error and I had to return it in a hurry because it was smelling up my house!  The hand cream works great and it is not greasy at all. The orange blossom scent is light and delightful smelling. Best scent and lotion combination! My fav!! great for dry winter skin love the product and was happy to order in this size, but the pump did not work.  Fortunately I had a pump from another product that fit this bottle -- else I've had been VERY unhappy. Love the product.Ordered this based on a friend's recommendation.Love it. This is my favorite hand and body lotion. My wife loves this lotion. We bought it at a local shop in St. Agustine about 8 months ago. She went thru the first bottle and then I found them on Amazon. Smell phenomenal and lead your skin soft  but not greasy. Great product and good value. Recommended!"
355,B0012J138G,".. This works well for small lines in your face, especially around the mouth area ... I have a couple of lines , one on each side of my mouth and chin area .. The pointed applicator makes it easy to add a small amount to each line in the skin, let it dry and add a little more until you actually see it disappear ... You may see some small crumbs of dried material after it dries, just brush it away ... The area will look a little lighten in color ... But the lines actually appear faded away .. for myself , I don't add makeup over it , because any foundation would wipe it away .. . A little product goes a long way ... Definitely worth the money to spend on this product for a temporary daily fix to hide small wrinkles .. Highly recommend this product ... I like this product but the price has gone up alot. It’s a great product for the elderly but being on a fixed income it is very expensive to use. Very pricey I read, with enthusiasm, the mostly rave reviews of this Regenerist Instant Fix Wrinkle and Pore Vanisher. I am 50 years old and, although I take good care of my skin and it has held up well, I have fine lines around my mouth and some on my forehead that I would like to see vanish. I tried a pricey product called Wrinkle Relax or something similar and it was flaky and awful. I was hoping that this product would at least blur the lines so they weren't so visible.Unfortunately, I am one of the few that didn't get great results from this product. It is thick and off white. You are supposed to apply your usual moisturizer first and let it absorb, then apply a small amount of this product directly onto the lines or pores that you want to fill. The consistency is like spackle which seems like it would be a great filler. I used it on the lines around my mouth and really didn't see much difference. Then, it started to flake and crust and looked like I was peeling.I washed my face and started over. Maybe I was using too much of the product. I again applied it to the lines, very sparingly with a slight tapping motion. I didn't rub it around or use a heavy hand. But I still got white residue showing up. I found that the best way for me to apply this product was after my primer which is silicone based. While my face is still a bit damp from the primer, I apply a tiny amount to the lines. It does nothing at all for my deeper forehead lines but slightly fills in the lines around my mouth. If I apply after my primer, I get much less flaking and residue although I still get some.I don't know if I am doing something wrong or if I am just too far gone to be able to use a product like this and get the good results others have had. It does fill in very fine lines a little bit and, once I found the best way to apply it, the flaking was minimal but I won't repurchase this product. I wish I could add my review to the many glowing ones here but, for me, this just didn't work out well. I will continue experimenting with different ways of using it to see if I find a more effective way to apply the product. If I do, I will update and rerate. For me, this is average at best. You may have terrific results like many others so I can't recommend that you don't at least try it. This cream is almost identical to the primer from the benefit Poreless. Same consistency. I'm a fan of the primer from the benefit, but unfortunately the Poreless is more orangy and does not fit my cold pale skin well. I dreamed of finding a primer with the same texture, but in lighter shade and I couldn't do it. Almost all primers on the market are creamy or too sleeky and finding a replacement for Poreless is difficult. Olay has exactly the same texture and almost identical ingredients , but a lighter color (two three tones). Apply the primer to your fingertips and you will see how the pattern on the fingers will smooth out significantly. I definitely recommend it. Makes your skin very silky. Just apply sheer fondation/bb cream on top and you are good to go. The delivery was early, the driver was cheerful, positive, Dressed nicely looking festive.The product was new. Perfect timing.Thank you for your service. I use it every morning and night, haven’t noticed any difference in pores or lines. I think it’s a good product, I’ll keep using for awhile"
356,B000X2FPXC,"I've been using these for years, and really want to give it 5 stars, but there are issues. This can really dry out your skin sometimes when used in excess, and can cause grease/oil build ups, especially in your hair. I combat the buildups by using it with baking soda when it becomes an issue, but before that, I'd have to rely on other products. This castile soap by Dr. Woods is excellent. I have been using castile soap for over ten years, and Dr Woods is always the brand that I use. If you like Dr Bonner's castile soap, then you will definitely love the Dr Woods brand soap. I have tried nearly every version of the castile soap that Dr Woods produces, and they are all equally great.Furthermore, the price difference between Dr Woods soap, and any of their other competitors, is very significant. Every year I purchase at least several gallons worth of the Dr Woods 32 ounce castile soap bottles. Probably around four or five gallons worth, each year.This soap is very gentle, yet very cleansing -- and completely natural. And each of the different versions of their castile soap smell excellent on top of that. I frequently smell them in my hand, before I add water, because I love how they smell -- it's like aromatherapy. And I use their shea butter castile soap as my shampoo. I recommend all of their different versions, including their black soap, which I frequently use as shampoo for my hair.One thing to keep in mind, is that the shea butter versions of their soap, does not smell quite as strong as their non-shea buttter versions do. That's probably due to the extra shea butter ingredient included in the shea butter soap. If you want the strongest smelling version of their soaps, stick with the non-shea butter versions. But either way, ALL of their castile soaps smell great.Furthermore, this soap is produced right here in the USA, and Dr Woods is a family owned company that produces it, so I enjoy giving my business to great hardworking American family owned companies.If you're looking for great castile soap that smells great, and leaves your skin feeling moisturized, and you want to obtain it at the best and fairest possible price, then you definitely would do well to begin using the Dr. Woods brand castile soap. I have not had any problems with this drying out my hands (as other have complained about with Castile soap). I purchased foaming dispensers to get the suds I wanted (not that that particularly matters).My only complaint, actually, is that the smell is SO STRONG and SO sickly sweet. I was hoping for a mildly sweet almond smell, but this is more like the smell of almond candy.I'll put up with the smell for now, but next time I'll be ordering a different sent.Update 12/19/2016: I'm not sure if I've just gotten used to the smell or if pregnancy has given me an affinity to sickly sweat smells... but the smell of this soap has grown on me (of course my fiance has always and continues to love the smell). I still have not had any problems with it drying out my hands (even with having eczema - and with this pregnancy, a new proneness for dry, irritated skin) and have switched out the hand soap in the kitchen for this soap as well. I still think I'll probably try a different sent in the future, but I intend on continuing to use castile soap, and I felt the need to edit this review For me this product is an ''alternative'' to Dr. Bronner's.  I actually love Dr. Bronner's but wanted to try something different out of the blue, so I gave this one a shot....especially at the price point you can't beat it.  I do dilute mine with water using the same formulated calculations as I do with Dr. Bronner's, and in comparison to that, I find that the scent is not as overwhelming as Dr. Bronner's, HOWEVER, I do consume more of this to build up a good lather like I do when I use Dr. Bronner's.  Just for the record I use my Castile Soap for bathing AND shampooing because I do have dreadlocks and it's probably the most effective thing on the market for deep cleansing (for my purposes).  Fortunately, I will still give them 4 stars, because I will use this ONLY as maybe an alternative (especially since I bought 2 bottles-2 different scents.  Unfortunately, I will probably NOT reorder this item from them again, because I am so in love with my Dr. Bronner's and I think it's more effective and I don't consume as much.  I'm sticking to what I KNOW! Great for my sensitive skin I bought this as an alternative to Dr Bronners which I have loved and use for many things. I was looking for a quality alternative.I use mine for cleaning, body wash, hand soap, and hair.First off let me tell you the smell is AMAZING! I am a very big fan of Almond and the sent is perfect here. The it is equal in quality to the other stuff, I found it to be cheaper as well. Mind you the price is continually changing on Amazon.I have thick, coarse, curly mixed hair. My daughter is more white and has ringlets. We both have trouble washing our hair because it dries it out and tangles it. Mine has the added trouble of removing all the oils that I put in my hair. This stuff broke down the oils, suds up beautifuly, and didn't destroy the moisture balance in my hair. A BIG plus.If you would like to try the shampoo recipe check it out.1/4 C of Coconut Milk1/3 C of Dr. Woods Castile Soap1 tsp. of Vitamin EMix and enjoy. Remember that most homemade soaps are thinner than store bought. I just apply mine straight from the bottle to my hair."
357,B001CL88QO,"I used this mask (gooy like baby food but thinner) on my face for almost 10 minutes after I cleansed it w/ the stone crop gel wash (the green one) & the strawberry rhubarb exfoliant. I have dry areas & milia, so I used a facial scrub for a stronger effect around my nose, chin, sides, & forehead & results were a lot better. The directions say to use the chamomile tonique to neutralize the mask after you wash the mask off w/ circular motions, so that's what I did afterwards w/ a cotton ball. I did all if this right before bed & my face felt so light that I didn't feel the need to put on any moisturizer (the probiotic one). The next morning, I only used the gel wash to cleanse my skin followed by the probiotic moisturizer & a sunscreen awhile later (by skin med 30spf). I'm going to keep up this routine w/ the mask at least once a week & see how it goes. I also have a mandelic acid serum by vivant which helps keep my face clear & eminence retinol alternative (bamboo fluid) which I'm not sure how to use...it is not a moisturizer. I also used an eye cream to hydrate this area (by Evan Healy). This routine is new to me except for the mandelic which I have used before & regular microdermabrasions, a must  if you're trying to exfoliate your skin w/ all these products. There's nothing like micro. Hope this helps w/ ideas... The texture of this product was rather watery and thin. I've purchased this enzyme mask from the Eminence site several times and this mask is, in its authentic form a thick puree. This doesn't seem like an authentic Eminence product unfortunately. In addition, the jar is only half full.I would not purchase this again from this seller. I'll continue to go straight to the official site. Bought this item based on a recommendation from a skincare specialist after a facial. Product smells great (like pumpkin sugar cookies), and has a fantastic effect on my skin. I have very acne prone skin, especially on my face, and was instructed to use this twice a week (along with more products from EO). When I use this peel, it doesn't burn, hurt, or leave my skin feeling overly dry or sensitive. My skin feels soft, clean and new. It helps any bumps that are under the skin come up quicker, or disappear without surfacing. If I have a pimple about ready to surface, it usually comes out with the removal of the peel without any pain, or spreading the nasty around. After application, there is a sensation described as ""activating"", I think its more of a cooling sensation, like when you first put on like icy hot, but not that intense, and I found it pleasent. Label also suggests another product to use after to ""deactivate"" it. I don't use it, but apply the second mask (Garlic and Tomato, also by EO) and finish off with tonic and moisturizer. With this mask, and other EO products in my recommended regimen, my skin has improved tremendously, even my husband and our friends have noticed, and that's a great feeling!!! Bought this so I'd be able start to build my exfoliation tolerance before moving on to higher peels. I love it because its fairly gentle but you can really feel it working. I get an active sensation through the whole process, though the second time was better than the first. Tried it both with and without the Chamomile Tonique afterwards and I think the tonique helps calm down redness and takes the residual active sensation away. Part of my lingering effects are most likely due to the fact that I have thinner, dry, and sensitized skin. I greatly prefer the tonique afterwards because it helps to soothe and since it is a deactivator you should probably use it anyway because it stops the peel from continuing to exfoliate your skin (which can cause redness and irritation, among other things). I'm also doing the peel once every other week, aka twice a month. This works out fine for me, but I recommend you make adjustments depending on your skin type and the condition of your skin. It’s ok , pero no me sorprendió Skin care specialist recommended. Was on the fence about ordering after reading some experienced redness after use.  I'm glad I ordered.  Initially left on for only a few minutes then worked up to recommended time.  I love the scent and my skin actually glows and looks lighter.  I did experience some redness however it diminished quickly and calmed without needing to apply any additional products.  Good value because a very small amount goes a long way. I used to use this 1x a week. I usually wait for 10 minutes before washing it off. I never notice any redness afterward but I did feel the light sting when it was on my face. However, you can see your skin looking more bright, like a glow, the day after. Excited, I then began using it 3x a week because I wanted some old acne scars to fade faster. It helps with the scars for sure but the skin around my nose became more dry & flaky despite me using a facial moisturizer. So now I'm back to using it only 1x a week. It's still good for exfoliation..makes my skin feel smooth. I'd recommend this if you're looking for a light peel at home. I ordered this peel after a Pumpkin masque was recommended to me.  I really like Eminence, so i went with them.  It smells so yummy and feels like my face is getting a nutritious snack.  I did not experience any of the tingling/burning I read in the reviews.  This product doesn't actually peel off.  I would definitely consider it a masque.  It leaves my skin very soft and feels very fresh afterward.  I like it, but I am not super excited about it."
358,B000Y18UKM,"My issue with this company is that their products are not CONSISTENT! That is why i don't buy them all the time. This batch however is good.This product is a bit watery in consistency but, do not be fooled. It works well on a washcloth and on a Goshi /mesh like product! Winters here are brutal and are as dry as the desert.  i want clean skin but i also want moisturized skin. This does the trick. I like this go round. It was an off-the-cuff trial, I’ve liked Shea butter before. At first I was unhappy with the thickness and the “residue.”However, I found the residue soaked in within 5 minutes, and left no trace except my over-washed-hands felt healed  — & protected.Even putting it on my back left no itchy residue I am always looking for products with raw shea butter for my skin, I have psoriasis and have several prescription lotions to manage my condition.  Unfortunately for the prescription lotion, the remedy is short lived.  After months of use, the medicine becomes ineffective.  So another prescription is added to my regime and this keeps going on and on until you come to the conclusion that there is simply no cure.  I have also used shea butter but oftentimes what I find are heavily perfumed and / or simply raw.  The Nubian product - both body wash and lotion are very creamy and smooth.  It has helped me tremendously in keeping my skin moist and outbreak free.  I have lessened my prescription use to simply the Nubian Heritage products - body wash & lotion.  I have shared my experience with my dermatologist who I see regularly in managing my condition and she has added both products to recommend for her other patients. I can never have enough of this product and keep my shelves well stocked.  The list of prescription lotions and my dependency on them have slowly diminished.  YAY!!!!! I love the smell and in conjecture with the lotion it’s great. Oddly enough now I’ve had it now 2months, every time I open the bottle it’s full of gas. Not sure if it’s BPA?? Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter body wash is everything I could want in a bath product. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I only like to use natural/organic products. The problem is that it's hard to find natural products that are actually natural and don't have hormone-altering ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate or some form of petroleum. Additionally, many natural products don't smell good, don't lather hardly at all, or just don't leave my skin with a ""clean"" feeling.NH shea butter body wash smells so nice and clean. It leaves my skin feeling fresh, but not perfumed. It doesn't irritate my skin, and it makes a light lather that is perfect for washing or shaving. I have even used it in my hair a couple of times when I ran out of shampoo, and it didn't dry it out at all!I have used SO many different natural/organic body washes, but I've never been as satisfied as I am with NH shea butter. As an added bonus, this company has an ethical supply chain that works toward alleviating poverty in the communities where their ingredients are sourced. Two thumbs up! I don't want to leave a 2 star rating, because I initially LOVED this body wash. It smelled fine, cleaned great, and really left my skin feeling soft. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin, and when I washed with this, I noticed I did not have to use lotion as often as I have with other body washes or soap. I also loved knowing that I was washing my body with safer ingredients than typical brands. The price was reasonable as well.So, why the 2 stars if it was so great? Because after two months or so, this stuff starts to stink. I mean really stink. I don't know why this is happening, but this stuff goes bad quickly. I did not get any water in the bottle or anything like that. Just one day I noticed it smelled a little different, and over the next two weeks it progressed from ""different"" to ""horrible"". I cannot get rid of the smell with perfume either, I have to actually take another shower and wash it off.While I understand that ""natural"" soap can be less stable than other soaps, there is no reason a soap should go bad after two months! I have bought all kinds of ""natural"" soaps/body washes, from both established brands like this one as well as small indie companies, and I have never had a soap go bad before. It is a waste of my money to buy soap that I can't even finish using, and it also makes me question how this product is formulated if it has such a small shelf life.I use a body lotion from this same company and love it, but this soap is so not for me. Maybe I just got a bad batch? I'm hesitant to try again and find out. I usually use Dr. Bronners Castle soap (which I still use) but was looking for something a little less drying. I first saw this soap in a store in Harlem some years earlier but while browsing Amazon came across it again and was really excited because I remember liking the soap. Although the formula is mainly Coconut oil like the castle soap I think the Shea butter in this soap helps achieve more of a moisturizing capablility. Not to mention it is SUPER concentrated, a little goes a looong way and that is why I say its worth the $9, $10 although I will say the shipping is expensive. I will estimate that it lasts AT LEAST 2x as long as a regular size bodywash from the local grocery/walmart and that is with two people using it everyday once a day. My boyfriend thinks I spend too much money on frivilous items but he attests and raves about the value of this soap, he loves it too! And did I mention it smells good and i can smell it on myself throughout the entire day. So far the pros have me buying it a third time now from Amazon although the shipping charges may get to be too much... I use this product as a daily body wash and I love it! I had a procedure done and the doctor said to use silicone gel to help smooth and reduce scarring but instead I just used this daily body wash. The results are the same as if I used silicone gel. It’s natural and the ingredients work."
359,B000KOLXKM,"You have to understand I have been using Loreal products since I was a teenager. I am now 68! So now I am using 55+ creams and potions. I can't afford the pricey stuff, and my Dermatologist says we don't have to spend a fortune on skin care as long as we use something! My beautiful mom used to use LA Prairie,  well, she had gorgeous skin, and people told us we looked like sisters. I tend to think Goog ol Gene's had something to do with it! My grandmother did as well! But if you have ever priced LA Prairie,  then you would understand what I am talking about.  You are lucky if you can afford that! I have tried Roc and hated how dry it made my face feel! Just thought I would give it a try. Nope thanks! Mistake! Went right back to my Loreal! I should have known! The only thing I HAD to change because they stopped making my facial cleanser, and DON'T like what they have now, I went back to Estee Lauder facial Cleanser, which I have used for YEARS! It's wonderful. (In the pink tube) And you can get it on Amazon as well! I have used this for year and I love it. I don’t use this for the conventional reason. I have a rare disease called blephoraspasm, which causes my eyes to spasm. Long story short, I was looking at the possibility of needing to do shots around my eyes to get it to calm down and I was not about ready to do that because I really hate needles. Someone online recommended using eye cream to see if it would help and after doing a lot of research, I came across this product, and decided to try it. Much to my happy surprise, it works extremely well. And is somebody who has very sensitive skin, this does not cause me any problems. I do generally have dark circles under my eyes and find that this product has helped with that too! This cream does everything it says it will. After 2-4 weeks, you'll see a big difference as it fades dark circles and keeps wrinkles from forming. Best product I've found and worth the money. Esta crema es buena, porque mantienes mis ojos hidratados, no se acumulada debajo, es súper ligera y muy fácil de aplicar, el envase viene medio vacío. La uso en las mañanas y las noches antes de dormir, la zona se ve muy bien, pero no he notado que mis ligeras ojeras hayan reducido. Under eyes Keeps skin young looking. Beats searching a store with a lot of other products. I have a problem with bags under my eyes and this product really delivers. I love all of the Loreal skin care products. Way better than Olay."
360,B000EGMHKQ,"There are many reasons why you get brown spots on your skin (pregnancy hormones, pigmentation problems due to a pimple, exposure to sun, and just plain age). I did some research and found that there are three HUGE solutions that, combined together can stop the spot from getting darker, and start to heal it. There are three major factors that work together  to help treat, eliminate and hide the brown spot. Here's what I found:1)ALWAYS WEAR SUNSCREEN! This is definitely crucial, otherwise no matter the cause of the age spot, it WILL get bigger if your skin does not have adequate protection from the sun. I wear Oil of Olay Daily Moisture Lotion w/SPF on top of this product.2)Citric Acid is a key all natural bleaching ingredient. This coming from fruits such as oranges and lemons, lemons having the highest amount of citric acid.2)Olive Oil! Yes the same thing that works on hands to soften them also works good for brown spots. The Vitamin E in the Olive Oil moisturizes your skin, and stimulates the cells in your skin to regenerate. This is especially good in its most raw form because in order to remove the dark spot, you have to treat through 21 layers of skin!3) Athough this product does not include buttermilk, I still apply buttermilk twice a week to the spot (and my face) twice a week in addition to this product. Get ready to plug your nose because it works best if it's spoiled! I put mine in a pump bottle that dispenses nail polish remover. I use a cotton swab, dab a couple times then wipe off.I have one brown spot (and there's no way I'm posting a pic of it). I noticed it after a pimple healed. But I was also in my first trimester of pregnancy. So hormonal or because of the pimple or both? Not sure. But, from the first week I started using this product it worked immediately!! The bottle is extremely slow but a little goes a SUPER long way! I only use a tiny bit each night and under makeup. Make sure to massage it in well. After all, it is an oil!!!This is truly an INCREDIBLE product!!! A+++! Here's the major ingredients that make it work (that actually back up the research I did: Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Squalene, Citris Aurantium, Dulcis (Orange), Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lavadula Angustifiola (Lavender) Oil, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil. **THIS IS THE INGREDIENT LIST IN IT'S EXACT ORDER.**Before expensive and sometimes dangerous medical routines to remove brown spots, try this! I love it and I will continue using it every single day.....You WON'T regret it! I am a person with sensitive skin, that gets super oily during the day and uncomfortably dry when cleaned. When I use regular cream moisturizer, it irritates my skin making it itchy sometimes. However, when I use Olivella, my skin feels a lot better, I want to say it soothes my skin, but not to that extent. I just know that when my skin is dry, the dryness disappears right after I use this.I use this every night, after a shower, but I use veerrry little. Like half of the droplet goes on my slightly dampened skin. And what makes this product convenient is, because it's oil-based, it naturally becomes a make-up remover without the chemicals. So I just gently brush the eyeliner under my eyes with my finger (not with a towel cause thats bad for your eyes) and wipe my finger on a napkin (If I need more oil, I just use a bit of the remaining half of the droplet).Next, I can use the remaining on my hair just on the top part where my hair separates so the tiny hairs don't stick up in the air. It adds a bit of shine to my hair as well.Lastly, I rub it in my hands, and i'm all ready for bed :DIn conclusion-its great instant relief for my oily clean that gets really dry when cleaned-don't cause acne for my skin type-can be used as a make-remover while moisturizing my face-relaxing smell-adds shine and smoothens up my hair(but dont use it on strands of hair or it'll make u look like you haven't washed ur hair in days. Use very little)-if used in moderation, doesn't look like you have oily skin-If done after a shower with damp face and wake up in morning, will not look oily at all. Instead, will feel soft and un-oily-Last a long time if used in moderation (I just use one-two drops a day) had it for so long I don't even remember how long its been. (maybe 4-5months?) I first reviewed this item in September 2016, and now over 3 years later, it is still the only moisturizer that I use.  I had been searching for a new moisturizer that wasn't tested on animals and found Olivella.  I try to only use products by companies that don't test on animals and Olivella seems to stand for the causes I support (it's natural, ""green"" and cruelty-free).  It cost more than I would prefer to spend but this little bottle lasts a long time - I only need to order this twice a year!  So the cost isn't really a factor when you take into consideration how long it lasts.This product hasn't caused any issues and I love the way it feels (also, my skin has never felt oily or greasy after putting it on.  It sets in quickly and makes my face feel nice and soft).  It reminds me of the Italian side of my family's skin and complexion (sadly I didn't inherit those genes, haha).  Based on previous reviews before purchasing, I knew not to apply this moisturizer onto dry skin.  At first I was confused by this, but once you do it yourself you will understand.  After I step out of the shower, I lightly pat my face with a towel so it's not dripping wet but still damp/moist.  Then I use just ONE pump of this moisturizer.  That's it, just one pump (you'll think it's not enough, but it is! haha).  I pump it onto my hand and it covers my face perfectly. Having some moisture on your face helps the product cover your whole face without leaving an oily, greasy feeling (and using only one pump means the bottle will last a long time, haha).  I can't recommend this enough, I will continue using it for as long as it's available. My face"
361,B000TBZ8YS,"Just received today, March 21,2022. Bought it on sale of 50-ish% for $4.50. This is 4 oz. so about 1.12/oz.1st pic shows that it will expire in April/2022, I should of seen it coming since it on sale of a sudden. But something to mention is that I haven’t seen the sticker the covers the “actual ingredients” that some of the other comments has mentioned. So, I can’t confirm if it is really a mineral ingredients or are they right about the chemical ingredients.2nd pic shows the consistency and spreadability of the sunscreen. It’s very thick and you have to work it to spread, on the scale of 1-10, I gave it a 5 on spreadability. But even on my hands, it feels kind of heavy, so I don’t really want to test how it would feel on my face. Maybe because the sunscreen I received is about to expired. So, take all of my review with a grain of salt.3rd pic shows the look after it well spread on my hands. It’s kind of shiny, as you can see on the pic, but my hands keep leaving some stains on my phone case and screen, maybe it’s because it’s not absorbing into the skin, but it does make me consider this a bit greasy.For the scent, it’s like clay or play-Doh, it’s semi-strong a first, after like 10 mins, there’s still like a light bad scent lingering. So, if you care a lot about the scent, this might not be for you.I haven’t test if it’s actually effective in terms of sun-protection.So overall, I gave it 3/5 Jason sunscreen, SPF 30 (Minerals), works very well to protect from getting burned. I use it in the ultimate area, besides triathalon swimmers, for testing sunscreen product value: gardening under the intense and perpetual California sun. I generate my own humidity by sweating a lot.Good things about the product:1. It works to protect from UVA/UVB, for long hours, even with a LOT of sweating. I sweat somewhat profusely everywhere when working very hard digging holes, on my hands and knees pulling weeds, moving plants. My work environment is a dry, hot, sunny, windy E/W oriented 4-lane street.2. I am very fair, strawberry blonde, blue eyed, I don't tan, but freckle instead. (w/o sunscreen I either burn, or turn red and then back to normal, but feel irradiated the day after working in the sun)Semi-Challenging things:1. It does burn the eyes if it gets into them. The problem is that only very small amounts, accidentally getting into the eyes will cause burning and tearing. Because it's very difficult to wash off, you must cleanse the face and hands by scrubbing with a good soapy rough washclothe or 3M pad, so that you don't end up re-applying it to your eyes by accidentally touching your face. As long as one is careful and doesn't use it too high on the face, (I wear a ""Sunday Afternoon"" sunhat to protect the face, it is not too much of a problem.Challenging:1. I really need a facial sunscreen that goes on, stays on in sweat and that REALLY does not sting the eyes. I cannot afford ""Clinique"", though may save up for their dry applied sun screen powder, or liquid that acts like a reflective sun powder for my face, particularly for the easly damaged skin around the eyes.Recommendations?1. I DO RECOMMEND this Jason product. It does the job on the arms, even hands (very hard to wash off and does not rub off w/o soap and scrubbing). You will need a separate product for lips and eye area that does not burn. First let me say I love this product! I am allergic to the ingredients in traditional sunscreen and if I even come in contact with it, I develop hives. I have searched and searched for a sunscreen that won't cause this reaction, as I spend a lot of time outside and in the sun. It finally occurred to me that the mineral makeup I wear contains sunscreen and after looking at the package, I realized it only contained Zinc and Titanium. So I began Googling sunscreens with just these ingredients, assuming that sine my makeup didn't cause any reaction, a sunscreen with just these ingredients wouldn't either and I was right!I chose this brand because I have used several other products from Jason in the past and loved them. This sunscreen is a mineral sunscreen and from what I read, it doesn't absorb into your skin as much, but acts as a physical barrier on top of the skin against UVA/UVB rays. Mineral sunscreen is the now what is recommended instead of traditional sunscreen because of the effects of the chemicals in it. This lotion is pretty thick and you have to spend a few minutes rubbing it in well. It is very thick and white, but once you rub it in, you can't see it. And it worked perfectly. I also think the price is pretty good for a product that also doesn't contain any other chemicals and some of the ingredients are organic. You don't need to use as much of this lotion as you would think because of how it spreads and sinks in. I highly recommend this to anyone who has had previous problems with reactions to sunscreens.  I love Jason sunscreen but would not buy from this seller again. I had to purchase different sunscreen for my vacation because this product hasn’t arrived yet. This particular one wasn’t prime so I guess it’s snail mail all the way. 2-3 weeks. 🙄"
362,B000W3VABS,"I used to put on lotion all over my body after taking a shower because my skin would get dry until I used this soap. Now, I don't have to put lotion all over my body anymore because this soap cleans and moisturizes my skin at the same time somehow. If you suffer from dry skin, I highly recommend you use this soap! This soap is good in terms of natural ingredients, but it loses its structural integrity after only a few days of being in a shower or in a soap dish. The small amount of water at the bottom of the soap dish “melts” the bottom of the bar of soap, and this process continues until there is just thick green soap sludge at the bottom of the dish. This is a common problem with olive oil soap, but this brand has not not found a good way around it. I’d recommend “Anatolia Daphne” olive oil soap to help with this problem - it’s not perfect, but it does a better job that this brand does. It's matter of taste, but I like total absence of fragrance in this soap. It just lightly smells with cleanliness. I'd say the soap is oil-neutral, will work with various types of skin. Besides, it lasts for ever and cost next to nothing. Pure soap. Great for sensitive skin, good scent but unfortunately I need more moisturizing. I had acquired skin rashes from mainstream soaps and detergents. I switched to no fragrance or dye washing soaps. This olive oil soap is perfect for sensitive skin because it cleans well, helps to prevent dry skin and doesn’t leave an oily residue in the shower. This soap is exactly what I was looking for.  It's the original Greek green soap that our grandmothers used to use.  It's gentle, no fragrance, and can be used for sensitive skin.  I find it works better on my face than most face washing products. I love the way my skin feels after washing with this soap.  I thought it was kinda pricey, but the bars are huge. This is an amazing gentle soap!  Advertised as non scented.  It does have the scent of olive oil and maybe a little smoke but that's the worst I can say about it.  It makes a great lather and does NOT dry my skin.  I look forward to using it every day.  Some days I even wash my hair with it.  I suppose it would be nice to have a flowery fragrance but not at the expense of  drying out my skin!  (Besides, I find some fragrances offensive.)"
363,B000NVMM1G,"I use several Oil of Olay products and am always very satisfied with them. A lot of reviewers have complained that this formulation is really inferior to the first one, but I still find it more effective than other brands of intense moisturizer I've tried, and will continue to buy it. I preferred the original fragrance, which was longer-lasting, but the new one is still pleasant. The lotion acts quickly to provide the deep, lasting moisturization that my winter-dry skin craves, and it's a great after-sun lotion for summer, too. It absorbs quickly, with no greasy, sticky feel afterwards, and really makes a big difference in the condition of my hands.So convenient to buy it at Amazon for a good price! I love the size of this Olay lotion bottle - it is PERFECT for traveling.  With increased hand washing, you need a handy travel lotion whether you're on a plane or in your work office. I’ve been using Olay products for many years, basically grew up with their products, my mom used their products since I can remember!!!!  So I got hooked when I was young!!!! Leaves a shimmer on the skin This is really really great lotion, especially for the price. It smells really pretty but is not at all overpowering, and it leaves my skin really super smooth. It absorbs very quickly even 1st thing after a shower and it is light enough so that I have even put it on my face a few times when I was out of moisturizer. It didn't break me out (I have normal to moderately oily skin and I am 45 years old)  but it isn't the most perfect thing for facial moisturizer either. It IS perfect as an everyday body lotion and I will absolutely be buying more. Gave this item to my daughter as an early Christmas present.  It arrived promptly an in good condition. The fact that it came in a tube instead of one of those pump bottles was a very positive sight.  My daughter says she likes it a lot.  She is 36 years old now and has suffered with extremely dry skin since she was a teen.  I would recommend trying this product. I have tried so many times for super dry skin, and this one works when I need it the most.I recommend this for anyone looking for a lotion that helps when you have super dry skin and need the moisture that badly."
364,B000NB3VMA,"I am 39 years old, I have been getting facials for 20 years, used every product to mankind from AHAs, retinol, vit c, etc.  I begad glycolic acid peels in my late 20s, being a nurse, I am very well informed about different great products. I began botoxing my forehead in my late 20s and have done doctor chemical peels for 10 years...  I got tired of spending soooo much money of glycolic creams that were a fortune with far less glycolic content than this cream.  I LOVE this cream!!! I bought 3 months ago and use daily.  Here is what I love...Glycolic acid to me is still the only formula that rejuvenates skin to look dewey and fresh and YOUNG...People say I look 30, and I think it is because I have been using glycolic acid on my face like a religion, nothing peels and resurfces skin better with removing dead cells than glycolic.  I am not a doctor, but just my EXPERIENCE...REtinol is great for age spots but so is glycolic and retinol is terrible if you even have the littlest bit of sun on your face you look like a tomato.  This product, within days made the surface of my skin look great and QUARTER OF THE COST! After years of facials, I began doing all this stuff at home when I just copied what they were doing at the doctors office and at the spa.  Glycolic acid 10% is sooo hard to find in a product.  I did use a daily 15% but it is much more money and I dont see much of a difference.  If you HAVE NEVER USED glycolic acid on your face, I would recomend using it sparingly until you get used to the tingling, my skin doesnt even budge because I give myself a 3 minute glycolic acid peel weekly at 70% straight glycolic acid (DONT RECOOMEND AT HOME UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND HAVE WORKED UP TO THAT STRENGTH)  But for daily needs for great RESURFACING this is the BEST BANG for your BUCK! Many other creams at stores cost $50 and up for less content.  Truly you are paying for brand and the box.  I have tried Murad, La Prarie, blah blah, every brand..you wont be disappointed if you love glycolic products.  However, you will still need a SPF with this cream, so I get my SPF with my fondation I wear.  I am glad no SPF with this cream bc I think it would lower the aacid content.  Enjoy and buy it, I dont think anyone will be disappointed! Using this every other day has helped my daughter tremendously. The face wash and toner can be pretty drying so this is a great addition.My daughter has been struggling for quite sometime with horrible acne on her back, chest and face. Embarrassed to wear tanks, and anything lower cut, swimsuits in the summer...it was sad. We had tried every treatment the doctors suggested (topicals, creams, anti biotics) nothing helped. We went to a dermatologist and she finally put her on Accutane which is a nightmare to even get if you are a woman, especially one in your teens. She took this for a few months and it was working wonderfully...then her blood tests came back that her liver enzymes were really high (shutting down high). So, they terminated that treatment. She was so upset.As a young girl I had the same issues...never on my chest and back though...but nothing worked. Until my mom purchased me a kit...it was called Aqua glycolic. It had a toner, a face wash and face cream. It helped me. Took a couple of months, but my face cleared up and only had minimal return. I searched everywhere for it...looked on here and found that it is now called Maderma. In fine print on the bottles it said ""formerly aqua glycolic"". I was skeptical, but ordered it all for her to try. It has been a couple of months and her face is clear. She has no more backne, or any breakouts on her chest.I will continue to buy this so long as it is available. Aqua Glycolic is still number 1 for ""naked-eye""  visible & affordable results. This product has proven more effective for me over medically prescribed, otc &  cosmeceutical product treatments I've tried throughout my 50+ years. I love that I don't need a special high-powered magnifying lens to see my facial results of smoother skin, less noticeable lines & wrinkles, increased firmness, fading of scars and overall even skin pigmentation improvement. My melasma/sun-damaged skin along my entire upper jaw line has softened so much, a light coat of foundation actually cover it without break-thru in 1 hour. Use sunscreen when using this product. Use sunscreen all the time & everyday of the year.Customized use has been key to my successful results with this product. For me, using it as part of my night-time treatment skin care regime allows this product to work as it should without redness,  burning, or a reaction to my sensitive skin. There are nights (in all seasons) I switch back & forth with a moisture only night-time cream. Adjust (customize) your use depending what you need or don't that particular night. Dependable, gentle, effective, affordable & I never noticed a fragrance. A value based,  results driven, buy; all for pre sales tax of $20 U.S. dollars or so.In my honest opinion,  there isn't a beauty product, skin care regime, or cosmeceutical that will turn back a lifetime of living with my face & skin to when I was 25. Aqua Glycolic does the best job in slowing it down so much I'm given time to recognize & accept my older (but oh so much ""cooler"" self).No, I didn't get paid in any form by anyone for this review.  I just really love this product, the results & affordability."
365,B001GKEX4M,"I like the scent,and the creamy texture. It helps relax my restless legs. However  it doesn't help much to control my itching. I recommend a product designed specifically for that. The bottle is smaller than what I'm used to getting in the store. It's the same high quality I expect from Suave. It's an authentic lavender scent and great for putting on last thing at night to help you sleep. That said, it's a very STRONG scent. I wouldn't wear it in the same building with someone who is at all allergic. In a small room, it's the only thing that you can smell. I like this lotion a lot except that it doesn't rub in as quickly as others I've tried.  The scent is kind of ""earthy"" to me and I like it a lot.  I also like the fact that it comes in a pump bottle.  I think it would be difficult to get out of a bottle without the pump.  I didn't find it to be almost watery at all.  Maybe the formula has changed? He usado 3 referencias de esta misma marca1. Suave advanced Therapy Lotion y es muy buena. Hidrata y se absorve sin dejar las manos grasosas. Tiene olor suave que no molesta.2. Cocoa shea Nourishing lotion es la que mas me gusta, es la mas hidratante y se absorve muy bien. Huele a cacao.La volveré a comprar3. Lavender calming lotion la compré porque no habia existencia en Amazon las 2 anteriores. Siento que es la menos hidratante pero absorve bien y no queda grasosa. Tampoco me gusta mucho el olor a lavanda.Es probable que esta referencia no la vuelva a comprar. I’m not a fan of the scent. It’s smells too much like medicine. It also doesn’t moisturize for long. I’m always ashy after a few hours :/ I’m going to stick with their advanced therapy lotion. I like the smell and it goes on good after a shower but by morning it is dryed out.I don't mind re applying.Good for summer.I like thicker lactic acid lotion in the winter.I mixed this with some Amlactin .I like it just fine! It's lotion, so there's not much to expand on other than it is effective and smells nice without being too feminine. I've reordered this product a couple of times and am very happy with it. It took too long to get this product. I love the lotion but it took 10 days to get it. And the delivery person stated on the tracking that it was handed directly to me. It wasn't; I discovered it on my doorstep. I guess all that matters is that I got it, but was definitely not happy with how long it took to get here. (I ordered other items at the same time, and they were here in 4 days)."
366,B0012J30KU,"I have been using this for years and I love it it’s not oily not messy and rubs rite in without leaving the line on one’s face like some others do. I will definitely continue to use this. I’m a huge fan of my oil of Olay lol does not break my skin out has just enough faint smell to make you feel fresh after using it. I would highly recommend this product over some of the pricey products I have used. I did tried to get at the store but couldn’t find it, is so. I’ve I can buy it from this seller, I love it so much & is working nicely for my menopause skin , so happy I found this moisturizer is gonna be my moisturizer for ever Great daily moisturizer that is easy to apply and lasts all day. This bottle is a lot smaller than the last time I used it about a year ago. It does work good though. I’ve used this face cream for years and it helps keep the wrinkles away!!! This is the best product ever! I've tried multiple other formulas and brands for mature skin and this one beats them all. It minimizes wrinkles and age marks. It doesn't make my face shiny or puffy. It simply moisturizes perfectly. End of story! I can see the results for a matter of first week. Clears my skin, not greasy, and I woke up with smoother skin. I’ ll continue using it. Nothing special about it"
367,B0012C6PD6,"My daughter and I have been tanning since August. We had the real expensive lotion with the bronzers in it. I figured we had to switch it up a little bit. Although my daughter is half Italian; she is white as a ghost-due to my Irish, English, French!  I was getting a great tan; and she wasn't getting much of one. It was really odd that after tanning for several months; even at level 2; she just wasn't as dark as me! I decided to switch to this lotion; and now she is darker than I am! Although it works for me also!  So I give this a solid 5 stars because it really WORKS!  If there is a downside; it's that this doesn't last very long....this is her second bottle. Comes out a bit fast; you have to be careful!  Not bad enough to take off a star. You just have to purchase it more frequently. For a great tan; we sure don't mind!  Highly recommend! This is my favorite accelerator.  I don't tan that easily...at first, especially.  Then, I can usually tan better later on.  This smells great and does not leave a greasy feeling.  It gets absorbed right into the skin.  There is one version with a bronzer and one without - I prefer it without because it's very difficult to get it on evenly...and I want to see my ""real"" tan - not the chemical bronzer orange tan.  I have somewhat sensitive skin too, and it works fine for me.  This is not fake lotion - I ordered it here and used it from this seller - though I've heard there's a lot of fake lotion online.  I used this for 5+ years from salons, and this was the first I bought online...same exact thing. This is one of my favorite lotions as I like to switch out using lotions with bronzers and ones without bronzers like this one. It is an intensifier. I don't understand all the reviews that said the ""tingle""didn't work or it wasn't ""hot"" or the ""bronzers"" didn't work??? It is an intensifier and says in the name NO HEAT NO BRONZERS so I don't know why People expect it to have either. I lay in the bronzing beds at the salon which are more expensive but give a bronze color and you don't need bronzing lotions in those. This is very moisturizing but the best thing about it besides the natural beautiful color you get is the awesome smell!! I love it! I even use it again at night as a moisturizer and at amazons discounted price, I can! AG HOT! Smells great, and works pretty well. I have used about 1/3 of the bottle so far (about 6 times) and can see a noticeable difference. I had been tanning without any tan accelerator or lotions and wasn't getting much for results. After the first time using HOT! I noticed a difference. I appreciate the many natural ingredients, and lack of harsh alcohols. If I didn't already have a great moisturizer, I'd consider using this as both my tan accelerator and daily moisturizer. I LOVED this product.  It is NOT hot.  I used it everywhere, including my face.  It accelerates your tan an did not smell burnt after I was done in the tanning bed. It absorbed into my skin well and there was no reaction.  This also does not have a bronzer in it, which was an absolute deal breaker if it did.  I don't do bronzing.  Don't like it leaching on my clothes and in between my fingers.  I loved this and used it to the very last drop, which lasted me about 30 days.  Shipping was quick and if I tan again this year, I will reorder! I LOVE this lotion. I used to buy it directly at my tanning salon but I paid probably twice the price as I did here. Exact same thing, same size, same everything! So glad I found it on here and ordered it! This lotion actually smells good (like skittles), and you do tan a lot quicker/darker than using no lotion, or any other lotion I've tried. Also, if there is a bronzer present in it, it's very subtle, not one of those lotions that are going to turn your hands funny colors, or that you're going to get out of the tanning bed looking nice and tan and then watch it wash off 90% of the way in the shower! This stuff really does work. I had been tanning in a stand-up bed for awhile, and I wasn't seeing results. I have fair skin that does not tan easily. I have tried other (very overpriced) intensifiers, and none of them did anything that a moisturizer couldn't. I decided to try this after reading all the positive reviews. I noticed a difference after the first use! It really works, and I'm excited to finally be able to achieve the tan I'm looking for in a much shorter amount of time. The tanning place I go to sells this lotion for over $90.00!!!! I felt like a sucker when I found out I could buy it here for so cheap. It doesn't have a warmer or a tingle, but I am not a big fan of those. Every time I use a warmer or a tingle it makes me red for a few hours. I LOVE that it provides so much moisture for my skin. It is a really good lotion at a an even better price."
368,B000ZZU97O,"Great moisturizer.  Whenever I wear this lotion I get compliments on the fragrance. This formulation moisturizes my hands with one application. Other products require me to continue to reapply because the lotion soaks in and my hands (especially my knuckles) continue to feel dry. This product soaks in quickly, moisturizes completely, and does not remain greasy. I love it!Now, the fragrance is unusual, and just a little unpleasant. But it's not overwhelming, and I can live with it based on the efficacy of the product. No scent, really. Not greasy.  Absorbs fast.  Great for face and body.  Does not clog pores on face. Light on skin. Great for skin This is a miracle product. I have bad dry skin issues in my T area that gets worse based on weather and stress. I used to have to put lotion on 3-6 times a day just to look ok. This product works so well, that I can apply 1 time every 3-5 days! Yes! Absolutely stand by this product 500000000%! Many reviews mention how great the scent is, and it really is great, but many can’t quite figure out what the scent is. I get a chocolate (or cocoa - go figure since it’s cocoa butter lotion) scent right away, then after I’ve worked it into my skin, it takes on a sweeter, cookie-like smell that others have mentioned. It’s really a great lotion. Not greasy at all, goes on very easily and smooth. Absorbs quickly and leaves your skin very soft I love it! first - i am not kidding in the headline. i am extremely picky about hand cream, despite having hands that are dry as the sahara. if it's greasy or leaves a sort of film, i hate it. if it leaves my hands slick, i hate it even more. i had just given up finding anything outside of asian beauty brands - aside from l'occitaine, which, well, love their handcream, but my wallet does not love the price. until i picked up some of this stuff in desperation at the store. IT'S FANTASTIC. it doesn't sink in as instantly as some korean handcreams, but it sinks in pretty darn quick. it isn't greasy, it doesn't leave my hands slick, and it packs some real moisturising power. the scent is really lovely.best of all, since it's also for body, it is great to just put some on your feet at night and anywhere else that needs a bit of care like your elbows.i've absolutely been going through a tube of this about every two months. amazon makes it really easy to repurchase, and the cost is SO much better than having to special order from asian companies or having to fork over a huge amount of cash for very bougie handcream each time. plus i can use it on my feet as well, so it gets to replace not just one but *two* beauty products in my routine and save me even more money! First time I used it, years ago now I noticed how soft my elbows were after the first try. They have only gotten softer to the touch. I use no other body lotion but this period. I like the smell but I choose it because it works on dry skin and daily use year after year even without applying it, the elbows and knees are soft."

370,B000MC5US8,"Absolutely in love with this lotion. I normally use the African Black Soap lotion from this brand, and thought I had ordered the same thing until it arrived. Such a pleasant surprise. I was so mesmerized by the scent of this lotion I couldn’t help but find a reason to sniff myself all through the day. Not greasy at all, spreads on like butter, and again, the scent. The scent!!! I am not just picky, I get daily  headaches and wear very few scents at all, most bother me, give me instant migraines. Also, I am an environmental scientist and am aware many fragrances are bad stuff full of endocrine disruptors, given that the fragrance industry is self-regulated, a very bad thing in a capitalist society. In fact I ordered Nubian's patchouli and buriti - big mistake.  I (and my husband) hated the cloying scent so much I gave it one star and would have given zero if I could. The scent was like an evil entity I could not escape.HOWEVER I really like the scent of this lotion. I cannot guarantee you will, my husband also does not like this one. Too bad, I do! I was also concerned because when you go to order it gives the California Prop 65 warning which is a requirement if a product has a toxic (carcinogenic, neurotoxic) chemical. So I looked up every non-herbal chemical ingredient, could not find any listed on the Prop 65 list. Maybe it is in the bottle itself? But I gave it 4 not 5 stars due to the warning.Yet actually I was impressed with the ingredient list, and that it is cruelty free. So I will keep buying it. This has honestly been a miracle lotion. The best part of all, I mostly use it for my face! I've been looking for a great moisturizer that isn't jam pack with junk, but will also last a long time. With this I'm absolutely getting my moneys worth. Its a very good sized bottle, and little goes a long way! On the bottle, it says the lotion is fast absorbing, and I believe it! I can wear it under makeup and everything. Its been helping to detoxify my skin i've felt. At first it seemed like I was breaking out, but its just been the blemishes underneath my skin pushing on it (blackheads too!). After about a week or two my skin is on its way to the dewy pretty skin I've wanted for ages. I've gone through pretty much every other moisturizer/lotion on the planet, and i'm glad I never gave up or settled. This bottle is going to last at LEAST 3 months for my face. I've also been using it on my chest to kinda help pretty up so acne scars, and the texture of the skin there has been improving as well. This has honestly been a miracle. I have the most sensitive skin, and even baby mild products aren't mild enough. This stuff is great! the smell isn't at all atrocious on the senses either. It has a pretty mellow scent. I feel its kinda hard to have an issue with it. The scent I do smell, I feel is good. Who cares if it doesn't smell like mangos? I just want it to work well! Overall, this product has just been perfect. All those little tiny blemishes (that aren't even red, just tiny tiny bumps) have been going away. I've never seen my face so flat? :D This sucks because I'm not sure if a bad review is necessary.  Here is the deal:I LOVE this lotion!  Shea butter is quite arguably the worlds best moisturizer and coconut oil is right up there with it.  It's very thick, creamy and smooth.  It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave much of a greasy feel.With all of that said, the smell is VERY OVERPOWERING AND UNBEARABLE, at least for me.  I know many of you here like the smell, but I'm assuming those are mainly women.  (I could be wrong...don't jump on me...I'm not trying to be sexest)...it's more because it's a perfume flowery smell.  Well, it's lavender & myrrh...it's just a LOT OF IT.  LOLEverything I use is natural, including a ""Lavender"" scented under-arm deodorant.  It's a very light scent and because of it I thought this lotion would be the same.  I was dead wrong.  As a man (sorry for that...again...it's just my opinion), I can't see walking around smelling this flowery.  It lasted about 30 minutes before I was forced to shower again.  Even my Beagle ""Buddy"" was having a hard time with the smell...being a hunting dog with a sensitive nose. LOLIf you're thinking that I may have put too much on...nope.  I know how to use lotion.  :-)  It was little more than a dime size smoothed over my arms elbows and hands.  That's it.  I now very clearly understand those on here that mention the aroma.It is a very STRONG scent...please be aware.Do they make this lotion unscented?  I can't find an option anywhere.  Even like an 85% reduction in the smell would be tolerable.  :-) I love this lotion & get it at Whole Foods when I'm in town.  I ordered this bottle on-line when I was out-of-town on a trip.  The lotion seems nice & thick like I'm used to.  My only concern is that the expiration date usually found on the bottom of the bottle under the lot# is missing.  I'm not really comfortable with that.  I'll prob. stick to getting this product at my local Whole Foods store. I am always looking for products with raw shea butter for my skin, I have psoriasis and have several prescription lotions to manage my condition.  Unfortunately for the prescription lotion, the remedy is short lived.  After months of use, the medicine becomes ineffective.  So another prescription is added to my regime and this keeps going on and on until you come to the conclusion that there is simply no cure.  I have also used shea butter but oftentimes what I find are heavily perfumed and / or simply raw.  The Nubian product - both body wash and lotion are very creamy and smooth.  It has helped me tremendously in keeping my skin moist and outbreak free.  I have lessened my prescription use to simply the Nubian Heritage products - body wash & lotion.  I have shared my experience with my dermatologist who I see regularly in managing my condition and she has added both products to recommend for her other patients. I can never have enough of this product and keep my shelves well stocked.  The list of prescription lotions and my dependency on them have slowly diminished.  YAY!!!!!"
371,B00008MNZH,"I have faithfully followed my dermatologist's recommendations to use Eucerin daily SPF lotion for over 40 years.  In the past the company sold 50 SPF face lotion that is much better protection, but I've not found it available for quite some time.  So I use the 30  SPF with effective results along with wearing a brimmed hat.It's easy to smoothly apply so to add a day cream along with it helps to further moisturize my sensitive dry skin. I have been using this product for years and love it! I like the 30spf with a daily, light face lotion. In the summer it's not too greasy or heavy and in winter it helps hydrate skin just enough to minimize dry skin. Bought this product twice now. It goes well under makeup and sometimes I use it as my main moisturizer for when I go out. I have used this lotion daily every morning for years and often receive compliments on my skin. Thin, but effective product.  Not greasy, or creamy.  Very light.  I have very sensitive skin and cannot use most facial sunscreens on the market.  This one is a keeper!! This product is hard to find in the stores.  Very nice for traveling when you want a light moisturizer and need som sun screen. I wish it had a higher spf but it good I like itIf you have sensitive skin this is for you. Non-greasy. Absorbs quickly."
372,B0012GVT7O,"So far I like it but I think I’ll purchase directly from the Fresh website or Sephora. My confidence in this purchase is pretty low because the tube didn’t arrive in any form of packaging. Yes it was in a package since it had to be delivered but it wasn’t in any kind of manufacturer packaging. It was just lip balm with the sku sticker stuck to it. Also the outside of the lip balm looks like it spent months in a purse with other items scratching it up. The actual balm had no usage thankfully but I’m a bit upset with the condition it arrived in. As a consumer you expect everything to be packed accordingly and this was just awful. Very ghetto handling if you ask me but I’m just the consumer. Won’t be buying this again from Amazon. Love the product; it will not disappoint!!! I am seriously so happy to have had this stuff recommended to me!  There are times I have to take medication that dries my mouth out very bad, during that time, my lips suffer as well.  Some times to the point of getting deep cracks in them that so many daily things will cause them to crack open again and again making it almost impossible for them to heal while I am on that medication.  This product was recommended to me by a friend who works at one of those high end make up places, she is my go to on all things make up and skin care.  She knew I was not purchasing it from her store, so it's not like she was thinking she was going to get commission or anything like that.  She warned me that is was a bit pricey and said she thought my lips would think it was worth every penny.  She was 100% spot on!  When I am on the problem medication, I use this anywhere from 3 to 5 times a day and even through my lips get a little tight, since using this, they have not cracked a single time! Most luxurious lip balm EVER! It costs a little more, but the best things usually do. Warning: Once you try it, you'll never go back to another lip balm. Perfect treat just before bed. Love it! This is the best lip product around.  I love it so much I keep one on my desk and one in my purse. This is my favorite lip balm. I discovered it many years ago, when it first came out. I would love to have it all the time, but it is a little pricey. So I just treat myself occasionally. I received my tube today and am in heaven. It’s really good. Really. Love it Purchased February 2023. Product as advertised is old formula with SPF 15 (which is specifically why I purchased from Amazon and not a store), but product doesn’t have SPF listed anywhere on packaging and also appears to have been opened. Returning."
373,B00016WXEY,"I don’t know who is in charge of packaging but a box would have most assuredly been the better option here. The product seems fine though and I’ll just put it in a different container but still this is just lazy packaging. This is the best aloe vera gel I've purchased. I have been repurchasing this for several years now. I use this daily as a last step of my skincare routine. It's very soothing and hydrating! Also I love it in this tube, it makes it easy to use up every last bit, less waste. Been using this for years but recently found the 2 places I usually buy it no longer carry it but I was able to find it on Amazon. The gel is thick, not too sticky, and has a pleasant scent. I used this to retwist my locs, and after drying, there were NO flakes. I’ve used this on my feet when they’re dry, and baby, let me tell you…SOFT! I know this isn’t better than organic aloe, but I think it’s a quality product. For many years I have ALWAYS kept a tube of aloe vera in my kitchen for burns! By itself? It is very sticky. Mix it with 100% jojoba and it’s golden ! You can feel your skin thank you and will never try coconut oil or Shea butter for your skin again. I feel that the Shea butter we have access to in the US isn’t the real African Shea butter because it’s not at all moisturizing but this IS. ✊🏾 Moisturizing I tried it on my face and I didn’t like it because it made my face a little tight and made it look like I had wrinkles and I don’t have any yet.  I guess the hold has a film that forms a crunch and film on my face. It smells good. It surprisingly held my tight curls for a wash and go but you can stretch the hair. Also my hair was really dry and I had to redo my hair and put a leave in, in my hair. I ended up having the best twist out though. I immediately got another one because it’s healthier on my scalp, which has been breaking out lately. I would recommend, just put something underneath. Also this product has more slip when you had more water and it smoothes the cuticles of the hair well and defines my hair so well, that my hair shingles it’s self, but I still separate my hair manually."
374,B000OY3WNO,"The suki brand has changed formulas ever since they swapped ownership. It’s not the same. I’m out. These suki products are amazing. This is the first review I have ever written for a product and I have been through many skin care lines: natural, organic, synthetic, cheap, expensive. Suki is the difference between treating your skin and healing your skin. I am 40 and have been battling acne forever. I was using olay prox clear, and it was working alright but my skin felt so congested. I also felt guilty everyday that I washed and rubbed those chemicals into my skin. I decided to take the plunge and try this line and after four days, I have different skin. Honestly. I will probably never LOVE my skin, but somehow using these products makes it feel so much more beautiful and healthy. I use the balancing toner and bio-purifying serum in the am and then the toner and balancing moisture oil at night. I am finishing up an organic cleanser I am using, then will purchase suki cleanser. I really am amazed at how my pores feel tight, the oil is reduced and the blackheads that were started to fill every pore are gone. Four days - and they are gone. I might even add a moisturizer because the oil in my skin is gone. Thanks Suki!!! I have been using the daily moisturizer from Suki and it was working well but with our odd summer in the East Coast this year, my face is getting a little dry. I would use the lotion but then see some flaking hours later around my chin and cheeks. I looked up other products from them on their site and found the balancing facial oil. I used to use a facial oil before and it makes sense so I tried it. I love that I can get these products form Amazon cheaper than the main site! This is exactly what I needed! My face on the humid days, now that summer has kicked in, is a little dewy after using the oil but that's fine, I have no issues putting on makeup after my skin settles from my morning routine. I love the product. I REALLY dislike the new pump dispenser. It forces me to use much more product than I want. Seems like the manufacturer is using this method so I run out faster so I have to buy more. Thankfully I saved one of the eye droppers from an old bottle and can still use the 2 drops I need for each application. I have been using Sukiface for over three years.  I use Pure Facial Moisture-Balancing every day and night.  I also use other Sukiface products and love them all. Because of the cost, I cannot always replace them at the time I run out.  I love and rely on this product so much, I actually add the cost of it into my monthly budget.  I do not have acne, but I am nearing fifty and I have a very red face and uneven skin tone.  I have tried other products occasionally based on recommendations only to find (for me) it was a waste of money.  My children, family members and friends actually give me gift certificates to the store where I purchase my Sukiface from.  It is a must have for me. Feels light on my face, and has a pleasant smell.  Careful to not use too much - a little goes a long way.  Just 1 or 2 drops for the whole face.  Subtracting one star because of the price.  I feel like it could cost a little bit less since it's just a blend of various oils, which are cheap for a 0.5 oz bottle.  I'm sure the markup on this product is astronomical. Great balancing effect!! I had, HAD, super oily skin especially in my T-zone.  This fixed my skin in less than 6 weeks!  WORKS!  It foes not leave my skin oily for more fan a few minutes.  Last thing I use at night.  Now I use it weekly as a treatment  by my nose and on my chin.  When I wake up, no oil is noticeable.  My makeup wears longer too because of less oiliness. I give this product 5 Stars. Have been using it for 3 years. A natural product that has delivered improved skin, a dewy complexion while balancing oil as the name implies. Have been asked by many what product I use on my face....this is it!"
375,B000089SA4,"It's a good soap. I prefer glycerin soap to clean my face. I really like this one I was expecting soap that would be a good facial soap.  This soap is slimy and doesn’t suds at all.  It isn’t like any of the clear glicerin soaps I’ve used.  I won’t purchase again Loved it As others have reviewed, it doesn't lather well or act like a typical glycerine soap.  Additionally, the scent is a smell as if you've been sitting in a hot car for days. This was a mother's day gift, I didn't get it before mother's day though (because I was waiting for my Amazon e-gift card I earned online to come in).My mother has used this soap before, she has cracked dry skin hands (she works hard to keep the house clean!) and likes this soap, but she doesn't usually buy it because it's expensive for her and she'll use alternative bar soaps. I earned an Amazon e-gift card online and used a bit of it on her! She was happy for this gift! It is definitely something she will use. She won't just use it on her cracked dry skin hands, but in the shower so she can moisturize and heal her body too.If you have dry skin, this is a good soap to consider. I haven't tried it myself (or at least I don't remember!) but my mother likes it. :) Skin is not DRY I have been using this soap for years and I love it.  I have sensitive and dry skin and this cleans just right, no flaky skin and nice to use a product without all those additive and deodorants we don't need. My skin is extremely allergic and this vitamin E soap was recommended to me years ago.  I started washing my face with it at least 2x a day.  I have oily on T-Zone (only forehead, nose and chin)and dry on the sides of the face.  Not only did I not have an allergic reaction but this soap cleared my face, left my skin smooth throughout and removes the shiny oily feel.  The bonus was that while women my age are showing wrinkles,  my face appears the same after years of using this product. I have recommended it to many friends and they all have great feedback.  This product is amazing for the price - I only pray it never gets discontinued!"
376,B001E96NKC,"For face and neck. No wrinkles. Really good cream. Sometimes I try something new but I always come back to this moisturizer. I can always rely on it. Love the way it feels going on as it is very smooth, not thick, and does not smell like sunscreen. Make sure to follow the instructions on weening yourself onto this daily moisturizer. With any anti-aging cream, the anti-aging chemical can cause an initial reaction you can avoid if you build up to what you need to use. It can also make your skin more sensitive to the sun even though it has sunscreen, so you wouldn't want to use this alone for a day at the beach. I have combination skin and sometimes have breakouts but I have been pretty clear recently since I got back on this. I have been using this off and on (mostly on) for 10 years and I think my skin looks pretty good with minimal wrinkles except for a laugh line. I am 29.5 so I guess it really isn't fair for me to say yet if it works, but I can update my post at 39.5.  :) From the first use I noticed an improvement in my skin's texture; it seemed finer.  Also it doesn't leave an oily residue on my skin, unlike the Neutrogena Oil-free Moisture SPF15 I had been using.  And still, somehow, even in dry weather this moisturizer keeps my skin hydrated right through the day, without needing to reapply or making it a bit richer with jojoba oil, also like I had to do with my previous moisturizer.  I also noticed that my T-section doesn't get oily by midday like it used to.I didn't buy this product for it's anti-wrinkle properties, and have only been using it for about three weeks now, so I cannot make any comment about that.  Just a general improvement in skin tone and texture.  I'm happy with it. I've always been a Neutrogena user, first their bar soaps back when I was a teen, then on to their line of moisturizers as I've gotten older.  When this Anti-Wrinkle cream came out, I switched to it from the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion.  The price was higher, but still much lower than any other trusted brand with Retinol.Awhile back, I had a chance to test Olay's Professional Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Protocol Kit. Since I still had a full tube of my Neutrogena, I thought it would be fun to do a test.  I used the Neutrogena once a day in the morning on the left side of my face, and the Olay kit (two items in the morning, one at night) on the right side of my face.  Before testing, I took photos, then after a month, I took more photos. No difference in skin tone, condition or wrinkle appearance between the left and right sides of my face after a month!This was proof enough for me that Neutrogena has the same results as the Olay system for much less money and hassle. I would give this face cream five stars, but I just started using it last week so I don't know what the long term results will be.  After years of using L'Oreal Age Perfect, which is now impossible to find in fragrance free, and a short term disaster using Avalon Vitamin C cream, which made my eyes burn all day, I think I have finally hit on a really nice totally fragrance free face cream.  It comes in a tube, so there is no dipping the fingertips into the jar, which I always wondered about contamination-wise.  And the tube is easy to throw into a purse or carry-on, which heavier jars were not.  So far, so good.  Would highly recommend. i can't speak to its ability with wrinkles. i'm 31 years old, and started using it in response to my husband's sudden panicky realization that Someday We Will Be Old. i don't mind humoring him, and i haven't had the best luck with moisturizers anyway, so i figured why not.i've been using it for about a year now, and i love it. it doesn't make my skin break out, no matter the season or weather. this is a big deal for me. honestly, if it does manage to keep wrinkles at bay? that's a nice perk, but i have tried so many moisturizers. this one isn't greasy, isn't heavy, but isn't too light either. and above all: it doesn't piss off my skin.A+. Been using this lotion for years now, and I really love it.My only complaint is that the way the container is designed I never feel like I'm actually getting all of the lotion out. And it's not exactly cheap lotion. I've tried cutting the package open to get to the dregs, but it just feels like I shouldn't have to go to so much effort for something that I pay so much money for. I love it.  It is affordable, moisture, sun prevention and wrinkle cream all in one.  My skin looks great (I use night cream too, drink lots of water, and eat healthy) and in the morning when rushed it is great to use this all in one.  I have sensitive skin but no issues with this one.  When mine ran out I purchased again."
377,B000GLGBQ0,"I have to agree with the reviewer who said the goggles leak at the sides.  They are stiff, even in the hot sun, and they don't fit that well.  If you shorten the strap it feels too tight on the face and it doesn't really fix the side leaks much, so just leave the strap at the maximum length.  The leak at the sides doesn't matter when you are lying on your back and you can shift it slightly towards the sunny side when you are on your stomach so it doesn't bother me.It seems to have a pretty solid strap and strap connection.  I had another brand that broke in less than a year so that is important to me.I kind of like the green peep hole view from these goggles.  It makes you feel like you are deep down in the sea where it's nice and cool.The pair I got was dark blue (almost black) not yellow like the one pictured on Amazon.  Maybe the color you get is randomly selected.  I don't know.  I didn't get any kind of case, either, as another reviewer apparently did.I'll update this review if I have any problems since I've only used it for about two weeks, but so far I'm very satisfied with these goggles. very cheaply made, not to be picky put I order this one cause it was blue in the picture, guess im bad.. they sent me red..not a fan of red Only problem strap comes undone easily even if knotted. Just used these a few days ago-- they were just okay. They are made of hard plastic that doesn't give much flex and I was nervous that they were going to snap at the nose bridge when I was trying to bend them to better fit my face. I ordered these on Amazon because I wasn't sure what the tanning salon would charge, but these were actually more expensive on Amazon compared to the prices at the salon. (Only $3 at the salon vs $4.89 that I paid on Amazon.) These goggles come with the standard elastic strap so that you can size it to fit around your head comfortably. However, the hard plastic was rather uncomfortable resting around my eyes, even after several attempts at adjusting the elastic strap. I rarely tan so just looking for something to do the job of protecting my eyes. Although these are hard plastic and a bit uncomfortable they do fit snugly around my eyes and darken things very well but still leave just enough light that I can see and not bump into the bulbs. Easy to use, worth it! I needed new glasses for a stand up bed. These are comfortable,  fits like a glove, very good protection! Worth the $$ Great product. I have had these for many months now and they still work great. I like how they are not that big so they are perfect for the tanning bed, you won't have much unmanned portions of your face while wearing these. I would buy again. Flexible, comfortable.  I can see out of the little holes.  These are perfect for tanning."
378,B000KFX23M,"We have used Nivea cream for years, and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!! The cream is thick so very soothing, and we absolutely LOVE the initial very delicate subtle clean scent. This is a GREAT product - please don't ever change it! Thank you!! I use Nivea creme to stay moisturized in general and because I have atopic dermatitis.  The dermatologist recommended I use a heavy moisturizer creme.  I sometimes also use Cetaphil, Aquaphor and other quality moisturizer creams.  Nivea is very good quality and adds some perfume and wax to the typical mix.Nivea is very sticky, tacky and thick. It has an old-fashioned fragrance that I like. It goes on white until it is rubbed in.  So, don't accidentally get any on your dark clothes before leaving for work.  The virtue of Nivea being so sticky is that it really protects your skin much longer than most competitors, 6 hours or so depending on conditions. With Cetaphil (a good product too), I have to reapply throughout the day.  Nivea only needs morning and night applications, maybe mid-afternoon also if my skin is very dry or acting up.Don't use it anywhere you are prone to oily pimples. This is a heavy moisturizer.  Most people will only want to use it on their body, but I use it moderately on my face and neck too because an occasional pimple is better than the dry, itchy, flaky rashes that can happen with atopic dermatitis.Some people like to get the European formulation which lacks Petrolatum.  I have both German and american Nivea.  I lived in Europe and had to use the European formula for a long time.  I actually prefer the american formula with petrolatum. It seems smoother and easier to work into the skin. The european formula is waxier. I find no real evidence that petrolatum is dangerous. It is very good at protecting skin from dryness and is widely used without being a toxin.  I sometimes buy the European formula because it comes in an old-fashioned tin which is fun to re-use for collar stays, ear-rings or my daughter's barrettes.  Having the old tins around reminds me of my grandma, bless her.I like this size of tub, 6.8 oz (192g).  It's not too big.  With cremes in a tub, you don't want too big a tub.  Furthermore, each person should have their own tub.  By dipping fingers, it is possible to spread germs, etc.  I like a smallish tub so that one tub doesn't last too long and have a chance to pick up too many germs, viruses, bacterias, etc.  A pack of 3 tubs in this size is perfect.  I would use pumps, but all pump moisturizers are just not thick enough to work effectively. Some actually dry and irritate skin. I find that true by my experience and it is what my dermatologist told me. Always apply with clean-washed hands.Try Nivea.  It is a classic because it works.  The formula is quality. It can be difficult to put on, but it is more effective than most other moisturizers. My go-to moisturizer for 46 years now.  Amazon has a very good price. Every winter my face gets dry and this is the only thing that keeps me my face and skin looking good Me agrado porque si llego bien I received the rest of the order. Thanks so much. As a note this cream is very helpful with dry shin. Great product I am 79 years old and have been using this Nivea Cream since I was 13!Everyone compliments me on the quality of my skin tone at my age.I attribute it the use of Nivea for so many years.!"
379,B00028O7ZO,"Love the natural lavender EO smell of this soap. Have been using it for laundry and cleaning around the house. I appreciate that the scent is present when you’re using it, but doesn’t linger once it’s dried. I use it in hand foam dispensers. It cleans great and leaves a pleasant scent. I love that it's a soap without harmful ingredients. Nice Versitle I use it in the bath. Smells good. Goes a really long way. Just a couple drops! Love the product but never received it Holistic soap. I have used Dr Bronner's highly concentrated, non-toxic, biodegradable, liquid soap for decades. I use it for laundry, household cleaning, liquid hand soap, and dish soap. I typically purchase it in the 32-ounce size, buying four containers at a time. I had not previously purchased it in the gallon size because it is not always true that, when you buy the jumbo-size of a product, it is actually cheaper ounce per ounce. In the case of this particular product, that is actually the case. I purchased this specific one because I purchased a smaller bottle of it and loved it. This gallon does not smell the exact same as the smaller bottle (of exact formula). I could smell the sweet almond in the smaller bottle and even my guests that used it complimented the soap scent. This larger bottle has a faint almond scent and has a slightly weird medicinal after scent, I can't really explain it. It's not horrible at all because it is faint but I'm slightly disappointed that it's not what I was expecting. Overall though, it cleans well and doesn't over dry my hands."
380,B000052XW5,"One of my favorite products Easy to use and did it’s job. Very nice to make my feet soft and pretty. I love this stuff Sooo much, I have literally been using it a couple times a week for over 35 years! I dont actually use it on my feet or hands, Its an awesome facial exfoliant!! I super moisturize right after. My face is so soft you wouldnt even believe it! Well, I've been using this stuff for many, many years.I can't say for sure that they have changed the formula.  I do think that it worked a little better,or perhaps a little quicker, when it was in the light blue normal bottle.It is almost impossible to find in stores any more. We used to purchase it at WalMart, but they neverhave it in stock. There's still a spot on the shelves, but never any product.I really, really HATE this ""foot"" shaped bottle! The exfoliating part of the mix tendsto settle around the pink base, so be sure to shake the heck out of it EACH time you use it.To the people who have said it was a little watery, it is probably from the stupid bottle design.While it might be a little artistic, it is not practical, and make the liquid harder to use.Good luck getting the last of the liquid out at the bottom of the bottle too - I had to put mylittle finger in the bottle to get it to come out. I even added a little bit of warm water, which usedto help remix the drier part. Not any more - I had gunk and water. Shame on them for this lousy design!We get it - you wanted it to look like a foot. It is still a bad design for the lotion inside!Meanwhile, the product itself is still wonderful. I've tried making home versions, but it never works as well.There is a trick to this stuff. You don't just put it on like hand lotion. Use it on DRY SKIN (not wet from theshower) and you'll get better results. Do this over a trash can the first time you try it! Anyway, continue to rub,like you were rubbing something that had to be ground in to your skin.  You'll want to continue to rub even afteryou can't see the lotion any more. Keep rubbing. That's it - keep going. You'll start to see little bits of white.That's the dead skin cells. Keep rubbing - they'll continue to come off. Brush them off as they come off into yourtrash can. Sound gross? It's just your dead skin cells - don't worry. Once you aren't getting any more junk off,you can either try again with some more of this lotion, or if you think you're good, go wash your hands withsoap and water, dry them, and put on your normal hand lotion. Especially work this stuff in to your knuckles.It is amazing how dry skin can get there!  My hands feel like the proverbial baby bottom after a good roundof this lotion being worked in.It is amazing how much this stuff really does work. In addition to hands, you can really use it anywhere.I use it on my legs for dry winter skin, my face for the dry patches that have somehow started showing up whereregular skin used to reside, elbows and knees, and of course, feet and hands. It is really great.But whoever designed this current bottle needs to be fired!I don't want art, I want lotion. The bottle does NOT function well and adds a certainamount of annoyance to the product. It takes work to exfoliate arms and legs with Pretty Feet.  I bring a chair into the shower and sit down and start pouring the Pretty Feet  on and rubbing.  This  process takes work, but it's worth it.  My arms and legs are soft and look amazing after a treatment!  I've tried many,many other products through the years, but always come back to PF.  I could no longer buy it in  the stores I used to.  I tried Amazon..of course it was here.  The size available now, is not enough, IME, for multi-treatments.  In the past the size was larger, so there were more treatments  for the money.  I re-ordered 3 more, after only ordering one the first orde, just to have them around.  I am happy Pretty Feet is still available!!! My hands are in water a lot and get very chapped.  Using the best hand cream on the market does not do it for me unless I use this product on my hand first to remove most of the rough scaley patches and then use O'Keeffe's Working Hands cream.  After that they heal quickly and soften up after a couple of applications.This product is the best. Product is great"
381,B000VF023E,"I didn't pay attention to size for $$$ amount I feel like this serum literally tightens the skin around my eyes instantly. A friend bought some while we were at the Dead Sea & let me use it. I was on a mission to find some of this serum as soon as I get home! It is a little bit pricey but well worth it! Update : Customer service contacted me and gave me an option to get a refund or expedited new one.  I got my refund.  I gave more stars as their customer service was good but still only 4 stars as I didn't get to try out their product.Original  : My in laws swear this stuff is amazing so I ordered for the first time.  I thought I was supposed to get a new version (white bottle) but the old version of green came.  What's the point of advertising that they got a brand new face lift but then sells the older stuff.  It feels deceiving.  However, I didn't even get to use it as the bottle was ejected from the original package and broke among the other stuff in the box.  My other items in the package got to wear the serum. Condition of product when delivered was poor. This is exactly what the description states. Great Product 👍 Doesn't irritate my eyes . Leaves area nice and smooth. I have been using the premier eye serum for 9 months and I like the consistency.  I do think it has prevented eye wrinkles.  I paid a lot more money for it at the kiosk in the mall where the women are very persuasive and act like ""you are killing them"" when you don't pay the asking price.  I think they wanted $140.00 for the eye serum.  I paid $88. I think.  I am in Florida for the winter and needed more.  I figured I would check on-line and found the same product for under $35.00.  It was actually sent from Israel in the identical bottle so I know it is the real thing.  It took a while to get here, but there was no tax and no shipping fee.  It doesn't get any better than that.  My only negative comment would be that I only need a little bead of the serum, and it is difficult to press the blue top down enough to get something, but not too much that you get more product than you need.  I will order the eye serum again through Amazon. The last three bottles of Premier Dead Sea products I've received have had defective bottles. I've not been able to set them up for push-button dispensing, and have had to transfer the lotion (undoubtedly losing some in the process) to a small plastic bottle. I can't believe I'm the only one having this issue, but I urge you to get it fixed. I like the product, but I'm really getting frustrated with the shoddy dispenser. To repeat my review: Unless you can verify that you'll be fixing the bottles, I will no longer be buying the product. My three star is to average out the product, which I would give a 5 star to, and the bottle, which I would give a zero star for."
382,B00120U5E8,"I absolutely love this product! It keeps my face clean and healthy. It gives me great confidence knowing I’m washing my face with a product with naturally minded ingredients that do not dry out my face or make my combination skin red like other products in the past. Best of all it smells good!🤩 I love the creamy consistency & the clean tingle & the light scent. It is hard to find & I hope they don’t stop selling the face wash. Disappointed that Alba stopped making the cleanser I have used for a while now, which I’m sure the pandemic  had a lot to do with that.  Thought this would take off waterproof make up which it doesn’t. It also wasn’t that great at taking off my mascara which is not waterproof. This is a creamy cleanser and I honestly think teclear cleansers work the best which is what my old Alba one was. Package just looked like it had been open before Purchased this at the recommendation of my granddaughter. I was tired of spending big money on expensive products to remove make up and be good for dry skin. Glad I did and I will buy again. Effective and worth the price. I have horribly dry skin that peels/sheds if I don't take care of it, so discovering this two years ago was a blessing. I bought two bottles from Walmart and I just finished both, so I'd say it's worth the money, except now you can't reseal it anymore. You used to be able to twist the cap and lock it shut, so I'd bring it with me when I traveled. I'm sorry to see that it's not an option anymore, or maybe it's a different version sold in stores.Anyways, when I finally ran out, I was too lazy to go back to Walmart to buy some more and just borrowed my family's facewashes. They have combination/oily skin. Bad idea. My face started peeling, so I scrambled to Amazon to order a bottle and my skin is back to feeling smooth again (most of the time). I haven't found anything else that works as well as this.Just don't confuse this with the pineapple wash, which looks almost exactly the same. You do not want that if you've got dry skin. I have skin that just seems to get more sensitive every year, drier and allergic to more and more.  (My immune system is a bit messed up.)  I've tried a number of gentle face cleansers, and this has become my go-to.  I don't normally wear a lot of makeup, but this cleanser and a soft scrubby mitt get almost everything off--sometimes the waterproof mascara needs a little extra help, but that's it--and my skin is left in one piece.  I won't pretend that I don't need moisturizer ASAP after washing my face, but with everything else I've tried, I feel like I need moisturizer before I even leave the shower...sadly, that really isn't an exaggeration.If your skin is normal-to-oily, this probably won't work for you, and I completely understand how it gets negative reviews from some people.  But if your skin is dry and delicate, try this: it's gentle, the scent is light, it's pretty effective, and it's not expensive for how long it lasts you. It’s just okay. The scent is good but it doesn’t feel like it is cleaning my skin"
383,B001E724CA,"Great product! I use it for my ""getting rid of acne regime"".As a product, this is great!! As far as price goes, these (for 2) used to be about $16.?? at amazon, now the price is $22.??, so I will buy elsewhere.Interested in what I do for my acne cleansing regime? Please read on.Background:I have had acne problems for 11yrs, have tried many kinds of acne solutions, from creams and antibiotics to laser and light treatments...not saying none of these didn't work, but having acne as a genetic, chronic problem still causes it to come back, so I needed an ongoing solution - cheap too!  And I wanted to avoid antibiotics..chronic use is unhealthy. I feel like the only thing I haven't tried is Accutane, which at one point my acne was so bad i was recommended to try it by a dermatologist, but I did not want to do it due to the various side effects. I have a friend working at an oncology dept at the hospital and they give Accutane to cancer patients! That's how strong and toxic it can be.Anyways, back to my point...here's a great way I am dealing with my acne now. Cheap, easy, doesn't require much time at all, and safe.First step, I use a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil, then use this glycolic acid toner product w/cotton ball dabbing over the entire face, then use thin layer of benzoyl peroxide gel, then lastly, use sunscreen (w/moisturizer) for the day and facial moisturizer at night. Benzoyl peroxide comes in 2.5%, 5%, or 10%, so use the strengths in relation to the severity of your acne. I do this twice a day, when i get up and before going to sleep. Better, cheaper, safer solution than going to the dermatologist and paying for prescriptions. My skin has much improved. I have been using this product for a while now.  My brown spots have cleared immensely and when I use the moisturizer, my skin glows. My makeup also lasts all day.  If you have sensitive skin, you may feel a tingling sensation, but it should go away after regular use. You can also minimize usage to 2-3 times a week.  See what would best work for your daily skincare routine. I would buy the product again. This Reviva product delivers what others promise and they do it at a very reasonable price. If I were a billionaire, I would still buy it.  I could go on about what it does for my skin but what matters is what it does for an individual's skin, so I say try it. Highly recommend. I really love this facial toner and would recommend it to anyone, especially those in their 30's and above. It is specially formulated for mature or sun damaged skin. Although I have always been complimented on my skin, I decided to take a proactive approach and take preventive measures. So I tried this product a year and a half ago, and haven't even considered another product since. This is my go-to toner. Unlike many toners, this product is virtually odorless. It contains skin-essential glycolic acid as well as hyaluronic acid - both excellent for cell turnover and revealing youthful, fresh, glowing skin - among other quality ingredients such as aloe vera and demineralized spring water. People still routinely guess my age at 10 or more years younger than I am, and I believe this product plays a big role in that. Now I have my friends hooked, too! I ordered this product hoping to get the same effects that I have seen from more concentrated toners (notice, the ad doesn't mention the concentration of the glycolic in the toner).  I was wrong.  This toner really didn't do anything for me.  If you're looking for a really good glycolic toner to get the job done, go with DDF's 10% toner.  It's the best, by far, that I have tried.In addition, the item arrived packed very poorly.  One of the bottles had leaked out during shipment so that it was only about 1/2 full.Overall, if you're not looking for something to really refine your pores and let you know it's working, pay the extra $10 and get DDF.  You won't be sorry.  This product may be better suited for aging skin; I'm a little on the younger end of those using these products. Part of my morning and evening skin care routine. I am on the second bottle now. I definitely see the result. use it with 5% glycolic cream. My skin definitely looks better. I just moved to 10% glycolic cream and orders two other creams from this company. I am so glad that I found this product line! I love this toner! This was a reorder of the 2-pack. It's gentle but effective. It does have that ""glycolic"" smell, but it's fairly mld and goes away. I feel like I'm doing something good for my skin. I will continue to use and order this product."
384,B001394VAW,"I'm a 40 Carrots fan~love their moisture surge!Saw this vitamin serum and thought I'd give it a try. I've only had this a few days so I can't speak to how well it reduces lines. But I can say it feels really nice on my skin when I put it on. I do use a moisturizer on top of it. I'm not giving this product 5 stars as I don't know how well it'll do once I finish the whole bottle. Also, it makes me upset that the ingredients do not list SPECIFICALLY that this product contains PEANUT OIL. So, if you have allergies, or if someone in your family has peanut allergies, please do not buy this product. I don't have peanut allergies, so I've had no bad reactions. In fact....I had some blemishes that have completely healed just after using this product for less than a week. I've had this product for 2 weeks now, and have continued to heal, to show improved skin texture and no new blemishes. It has decreased my mild rosacea as well. Overall, I really like this product.For those of you out there who are concerned with the degrading of the vitamin C in the bottle, please know this is also a concern of mine. I cannot attest to the fact that vitamin C is stable/remains in the bottle. However, I have seen positive results. I use it nightly, under my usual retinol/evening moisturizer. Overall, I like this product. I want to finish the bottle, and then I hope to remember to update this review.UPDATE/HALF BOTTLE GONE: I've updated this review to 5 stars. I cannot say enough about this serum. Yes, this is primarily a vitamin C serum, but it also has retinol! I didn't even realize this for awhile (I know, duh). I was using double the retinol and wondered why this serum was stinging...well, with double retinol, it was easy to understand why after I reread the ingredients listing. And this is a very good ingredients list (with the exception of the peanut oil, as listed above).One of the things I LOVE to use this vitamin C/retinol serum for is to use in my homemade green tea spray that I have in the refrigerator. I steep my green tea, then pour it into my spray bottle (that I bought at the drugstore), spray at least 4 pumps of the serum into the green tea, and spray away as much as I want after I do my double cleanse at night. This is a great way to ease your way into using vitamin C/retinol without over irritating your skin.Also, another thing I've noticed is that I have to build up to using this serum. I started using it once weekly, then twice weekly, then every other day, then daily. That took about a month. I now have to say/type I love this product.Oh, and as for stability with regards to the vitamin C? Keep it in the refrigerator! That's what a dermatologist recommended, and it seems to work for me.HIGHLY recommend this product. I bought this item in a store and loved it so much but ran out of it. This brand is so hard to find lately so I was getting disappointed trying to find more but I Went on Amazon and finally found it! This is one of my favorite serums which I could use daily! I use it during the day and it leaves my face so soft and glowy. Smells nice too! I love this brand I even use the eye cream as well! Really great brightening properties too. It is a small glass bottle so it is compact for traveling as well. I will buy this over and over again whenever I run out! My bf let me go a little crazy on Amazon for my birthday, and I decided that I really wanted to start investing in better skincare during one of those annual panics when you realize how many candles are going to be on your cake this year but in no way want to look like you had earned them all. I had heard about this being a good vitamin/retinol serum for 20- and 30-something skin, so I was really excited to try it out (if skeptical because my skin is nearly impossible to please). The first few days of use were iffy.. the serum went on sticky in addition to making my skin look a bit dry and pink - though this extra color faded away within a few hours of each application and was not 'angry' irritation. I continued washing and moisturizing my face as usual with the serum being the only change in my skincare regimen. By the third or fourth day, my skin looked brighter and smoother and the dry appearance was normalizing.After about a week of daily use, I had plans arise unexpectedly and needed to be out the door quickly. I hadn't yet gotten used to the initial 'sticky' feeling of the serum or tried to wear makeup over it, so I considered just skipping that step but loved the glow my skin was developing and didn't want to derail any positive results. In my haste to get ready, I rubbed the serum onto my freshly showered and still dripping face and let it dry/soak in while I went about brushing my teeth, etc. Apparently that was the secret because the serum soaked in beautifully with no stickiness or extra redness, just glowing healthy skin. I've been applying it that way since (1 to 2 pumps, immediately after stepping out of the shower while my face is still wet) and my skin is the best it's ever been after about 3 weeks of use.Almost every product I've ever tried has caused dry itchy patches and/or made me breakout (some more manageably than others), but this stuff doesn't - in fact, it seems to actually be clearing up in record time the clogged pores and blemishes caused by an unfortunate reaction to a new foundation I tried. Tone, texture and balance have all noticeably improved and I'm being complimented on my skin for pretty much the first time in my life. I now feel much more confident leaving the house without makeup than I would've thought possible before. Will definitely be repurchasing in a few months when the bottle is empty."
385,B00164FVH6,"This stuff is seriously a miracle in a bottle.I am 24 and have had acne since I was 12-13. Mine is hormonal, the cystic kind that is deep and painful and highly noticeable and leaves scars.I began using this a few years ago and followed the 3step regimen perfectly at first. For the first time, my face cleared up really well. Eventually I got lazy and was only using this part of the 3step process. My clear face was pretty well maintained despite this. Well, I ran out of my most recent bottle and wondered if perhaps I could manage without it by now.  So I didn't order a new bottle. Bad idea. My face absolutely went nuts. I kept trying to avoid buying another bottle, trying other remedies. I finally gave up in desperation and placed the order.Once again, my face is CLEAR. I am following a slightly different routine with the treatment and I believe it is working even better than anything I've done before now.Here is what I do every night before bed:1) Face Wash - I started making homemade face wash. It is a mixture of organic, unrefined coconut oil and baking soda. You would be amazed! This stuff leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean. I LOVE it.2) Acne.org Treatment - I use this stuff liberally. I use 2 full pumps and put it all over my whole face. I buy it in the biggest bottle and it lasts for a really long time. It's expensive up front but it's well worth the money and lasts for so long.3) Moisturize - I use organic, unrefined coconut oil as needed. My face tends to get plenty of moisture just from the coconut oil that is already in my face wash do I use this only if my face seems dry to me.Every morning:1) Face Wash - I use my homemade face wash while showering.2) Makeup - I don't use treatment in the mornings as it just doesn't seem needed. My face is very clear just using nightly. My face is usually plenty moisturizer from my face wash so I don't usually need any extra. The exceptions are it I am sunburned or my face just seems extra dry. In such cases I may use just a tad of coconut oil (sparingly) before applying my makeup.This process is what works for me. Without following it, my face gets to be in very sad condition. But after a couple months back using this treatment, my face is so clear. My husband has even commented a couple times about how good it's looking. He says he doesn't mind spending the money on this stuff because even HE can see that it works and he knows how much better I feel about myself when my face is clear. I'm sure he also likes looking at me and seeing a pretty complexion!If you're going back and forth on whether or not to try this, take the plunge. Since my teen years I have tried everything. Proactiv, dermatologist prescribed creams, dermatologist prescribed antibiotics, every drug store acne product. Most of these products didn't work at all and the few that did were temporary fixes that my skin became immune to and stopped working. This is truly the only product that works consistently. I will never stray from using it again as I now know that it is the key to keeping my face under control.BUY IT! I've used benzoyl peroxide for 25 years - used regularly it completely controls my acne (arms, shoulders, and back).  I have perfect skin when I use it. Yet if I neglect to use it for a few days, I usually start to break out again, sometimes very badly.I love this product because it's the perfect strength - 2.5% - which I haven't been able to find on the market in many years.For years all I could find in drugstores was the 10% cream, which is far too potent for my skin. So I've long had to combine the available 10% strength cream with a neutral skin cream (in a tupperware container!) to bring it down to approximately 2.5%.  It's great to not have to do that anymore!Tips on using benzoyl peroxide:1) Benzoyl Peroxide will bleach out all colored fabrics. You don't want to get it on clothing, sheets, or towels, or let it drip or splatter on carpets or furniture.  It took me many years before I stopped ruining shirts, sheets, and towels, but here's how I now do it:  a) I use benzoyl peroxide products ONLY AT NIGHT, am careful not to splatter or drip while applying, and I take a thorough shower each morning with soap and a loofah sponge to remove it fully;  b) I apply it to shoulders, arms, and back, let it dry, then put on a long-sleeved white t-shirt (I order these online for $3 apiece).  I don't use any creams on my shoulders/back during the day, so there is no need to wash anything off first.  If I use it on my face (where I apply sunscreen daily), then I wash my face with soap and water first to remove most of it.  c) I only use white sheets, pillow cases, and towels.  d) I store dirty benzoyl peroxide clothing/sheets/towels in a different laundry bin, and wash it separately from my other laundry.  e) If you've never used benzoyl peroxide creams, or your skin is sensitive, it's probably best to start using this every other day and build up.  I use it every night with no problems, although I am careful not to get it near the thinner skin around the base of my neck, because it can sometimes irritate me there.A bit of a pain, all that, but by adhering to the above I haven't bleached a single piece of clothing for many years.For me it's the most effective and reliable thing for acne!Also, the related cleansers and moisurizers are just gimmicks.  There is no need for them, but people seem feel better buying a multi-stepped 'system' (Plus it's more profitable for the seller!).  I just use soap and loofah to strip off oil and dead skin every morning, then re-hydrate any areas needing it (face) with a moisturiser of my choice."
386,B000GDF48O,"After washing my face, my face felt so clean and smooth, Thank you, Murad ❤️ I am been using this product for over 10 years and am very pleased with the results. A little goes along way.  Very little scent. Cleans all makeup off with gentle massage and water.  My daughter and I love it. Very creamy cleanser. A tiny bit goes a long way. This is my favorite face cleanser. It is so moisturizing and yet cleans very well. Very pleased with my purchase of all the Murad products. Will purchase again. I use this with my Clarisonic brush because it's not too foamy. My skin feels moisturized and looks better than ever. I have bought this product several times, first time through Amazon.  I love this cleanser.  I have eczema and sensitive skin.  I was getting breakouts and using an acne cleanser.  I was getting severe dry skin and still getting breakouts.  I am not a teen either and didn't have acne as a teen.  This product was recommended to me by an esthetician who said the acne cleansers were drying my skin and making me break out more as my body tried to produce more oil to combat the dryness.  So I decided to try it.  It is the perfect cleanser to help with the dry skin and prevent breakouts.  It is mild around the eyes too.  Thank you Amazon for offering the product."
387,B0016Q1RI6,"Most products that exfoliate leave me really red but this has been gentle and great for clearing my milia alongside a glycolic acid product Normally, I wait at least a month to review a product, but I'm so astounded with this product that I have to review after using it ONCE! Let me start by saying that I have combination skin. I have extremely dry skin around my mouth and oily skin on my cheeks and nose with large pores. I've tried many products for combination skin, but like EVERY other product out there, it either leaves my cheeks greasy or around my mouth dry. My main issue is my large pores that are very noticeable.My skin routine consists of washing my cheeks, forehead and nose with a pore refining exfoliator. Then use a wash cloth to scrub my nose because it's prone to black heads. I avoid washing around my mouth with anything other than water because it's so dry. When I dry my face, I'll scrub lightly on my nose again with a towel. I then use toner on my cheeks, nose and forehead, again avoiding around my mouth. Then I moisturize my face. After that, I moisturize around my mouth again and sometimes put lotion on that spot if it's still too dry. After letting it dry, I'll put on makeup.Now that you know the crazy routine I go through, let me tell you that the only thing I changed was the exfoliator. I didn't realize this when I bought it, but this is not made with soap. I have shampoo like that for my pets (soap-less shampoo) but it never even crossed my mind that they can do that with cleansers and exfoliators. I thought it was perfect, I NEED something that doesn't have soap! This time I washed my entire face with this.I have never felt my face so clean before! I mean, I do at home facials and use masks, but I have never felt it like THIS! Usually after washing my face, I can feel right away that around my mouth is dry. I didn't feel that this time, at least not nearly as badly. I also didn't feel the need to scrub my nose with the towel. I did the toner, as usual. This time when I moisturized, I only had to do around my mouth ONCE! And my cheeks didn't look greasy, like it actually did the day before. My skin was so even, it was glowing. It improved the appearance of my pores so much that if I didn't know better, I would've thought I was wearing makeup. I actually sat there and stared at my skin because I couldn't believe the transformation of my pores. Seriously, I went from orange peel to almost normal.I'm so impressed with this product, it's almost like they made it specifically with me in mind. I couldn't dream of anything more perfect for my skin. I actually forgot how much I paid for it and saw that I actually pay just as much for my other exfoliator that is specifically intended to improve the appearance of pores. That exfoliator does a fraction of the performance this does. And it smells so good! I couldn't recommend this more for people with large pores and combination skin! This product is very creamy and you use very little each time. My skin comes out clean and smooth and I love the light clean fragrance it has.  My skin looks more radiant overall! I love love love this product!!! I was visiting my daughter in Virginia & took a ride to the mall while she was on duty. They were selling this at a kiosk. To be honest it was all very over priced & usually I would not spend the inflated prices. However about a week prior I made a mental note that my face looked different- not health, kind of gray overtone. I wasn't happy nor did I know what to change or do - I figured well I guess this is what starts happening as you age. So when they grabbed me as I was walking by I was open for a change for my face. They did a demo on me & I was sold because my face just felt cleaner!! Well after just a couple days of using my face looked drastically different. It looked amazing - fresh & alive!!! I no longer resented paying so much & went back to get 4 more tubes because I wasn't sure I would be able to purchase it back home. My daughter brought a couple of her female shipmates to my suite. I was telling them about it & they said go look on Amazon to see if you can find it cheaper. So glad I did cause I found it for less than 1/4 of the price. The kids dragged me back to the mall & I took the other 3 tubes back & ordered them on Amazon!! It is the exact same stuff & works miracles!!! At this price anyone could afford it & enjoy the benefits!!! It has a yummy banana nut scent that smells very natural. I keep it in my shower & use everyday. I also have a tube I keep in my suitcase to make sure I never leave home without it!!! By the way I also use their eye serum & the cream. At the same time I noticed the change in my face after using this I notice my eye area was puffy. I then got the serum & cream for my eye & mouth area Then the cream for all over my face ALL of the products made a difference but this scrub & the eye products were the most dramatic difference I no longer have puffy eyes!!! This line is great & truly works but save your money & get it on Amazon!!! Even their website is over priced!!! At 1st I didn’t think I’d like this because the granules are not big and it’s not grainy like I thought it would be. But just after my 1st time using it my skin felt soooo soft! It feels like nothing on your skin, not abrasive or irritating. There’s a light scent but it’s pleasant. Can’t put words to the smell though. I use this everyday in the shower and I swear my one stubborn dark spot that seemed like it wouldn’t go away has faded and smoothed out drastically since I started using it. The tube is a good size for the price and you really only need a little bit. I’m a Makeup Artist, so I’ve tried all kinds of high end and low end exfoliators. If I have to spend $50-100 on something that works, I will. But this is in my top 3, especially for what it does at the price point. My skin is combo, I have eczema and I’m extremely sensitive and allergic to ingredients. No, not sensitive like 99% of you that try something once get some redness and then scream you’re sensitive. I’m allergic to ingredients too long to list but this when I read didn’t seem to have any triggers for me in it and it’s working out great. I will keep using this in the shower daily and drop my glam glow one that was ok but didn’t wow me. It’s $25, try it. It’s really good. A wonderful gentle exfoliate.Great results This exfoliant is the holy grail of the skin care regimen. I remember a Jewish guy selling me this at the mall a really long time ago. I got the sample and was pleased by the effectiveness of it.. and I never bought the product except once, but to say I remembered how well this product worked for me years ago and bought it recently because I could not forget the value in it makes the product stand out in a unique way. You'll be satisfied how smooth your skin feels after one application."
388,B000056I89,"I have sensitive skin and I've had no negative reactions. I love it! It's probably bc of my skin type but it work on my sister Did the job but smaller than expected I have used Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, and absolutely no soap, on my face for many years. I’m 80+ and have no wrinkles around my eyes or on my cheeks. Wish I’d started using it earlier. I use this facial cleanser alongside an exfoliating facial cleanser. I mainly use this to remove makeup and it does a great job without having to use any makeup wipes or alcohol on your skin. I have very sensitive skin and after using this for years I have yet to have any issues. Been using this over a year now and i can safely say it has helped me with my huge pores especially minimizing the oil in my face. I use it about twice a day and it doesn’t leave my face dry at all. I have known this product for many year's...my children pediatrician introduced me to the body wash...and that was 35 year's ago.~Shalom!~ it’s not for sensitive skin, it has a strong smell. Everytime i use it, it makes my skin irritated, red and starts stinging as I’m washing my face. I have combo skin and i just wanted to try it out because I’ve been breaking out lately. Caused me to break out a bit more would recommend for combo skin, try the gentle cetaphil cleanser or the cerave hydrating facial cleanser for combo skin."
389,B000052YP4,"What does the product say?Neutrogena Light Night Cream is a light yet effective overnight cream.This non-greasy, dermatologist-tested formula absorbs quickly into skin. It provides an immediate surge of moisture, doubling skin’s moisture level for eight hours.Glad I went with the light version instead of the deep moisture night cream! Should be renamed deep moisture and extra deep moisture. This is a thick, white paste that hydrates my skin perfectly and helps prevent it from getting chapped from acne treatments. Sure this doesn't have any fancy claims but it does what it claims to do and that is all I can ask for. I just took off one lippie because this is not light at all.I really like this moisturizer. It is light when you apply it and I found that it would sink in quickly and still leave my skin feeling moisturized. I have combo/oily acne prone skin, and it never made me break out or get oily. I never tried it during the day, but I think it would work in a pinch! you get a lot of product for the price, plus Neutrogena is often on sale at various drugstores. Some reviewers have mentioned it might be better for younger people as it ""only"" moisturizers and doesn't offer other skin benefits, but I think that is fine if you are using other serums and creams, which I do anyway. Overall, great product, will repurchase! I have purchased this product many times in the past in stores and loved it. But when I could no longer find it, I bought on Amazon. It still feels great on and has no smell, but it’s like a lotion, not a cream like in the past. In fact, I wasn’t expecting it to be so “liquid” and accidentally poured about a fourth of it on my counter top when I opened it. I’ll still use it, but am curious whether it’s the real deal. Photos with other reviews show it more like a cream when the jar is held at an angle. Moisturizes without being heavy or greasy. I sometimes use it for daytime too. This is very thin, watery cream. It has no odor at all. I would not recommend. I've used this for the past few years and it's perfect.I've tried other drug store creams that do fancy things like anti-aging or helps with sun damage, tightening, brightening, etc.  They all irritated my skin or had little effect.  This cream moisturizes and gives me a very clean glow.  I don't feel greasy, there is no stinging, tingling or itching.  It's just moisturizer doing its thing.My skin type is pretty oily too, and I live in a hot, humid area.  Despite the weather and all that, this doesn't leave my face like an oil slick in the morning and I still feel clean and moisturized.  So if you have dry skin and you want to use this, just adjust the amount of cream you use accordingly.The lack of extras in this cream may be considered a negative to some people - look at it as an opportunity to use more intense products like serums on targeted areas.  Right now I'm just using some acne spot-treatment cream and a simple eye cream for hydration, and this clean cream allows those things to do their work without having conflicting chemicals.  I like it, I'm sure other people like that too.Totally recommend this product! Been using this for years.  Diminishes wrinkles and a nice fragrance free moisturizer. i  have  used this  for  over  25 yrs  and i  use it everymorning and  it  keeps my  face  soft  all  day, i have  dry  skin, am  83  and  everyone  cannot  believe i am  83  they  think  i  am  in  60,s  All other  creams i have  tried  dry out  about  five  min after  applied  or  are too  greasy.  i have  always  been  able to buy at Walmart or  Walgrens  till  three  weeks  ago  and  so  i  looked  it up on  internet and was  overjoyed  i  could order  it  on Amazon This is the absolute best night cream ever. I gave it 5 star rating in every category, including 5 stars for scent because IT HAS NO SCENT!  (Last thing I want to do when going to sleep is to smell my own face cream.)  This cream was excellent.I am so bummed out that I can no longer buy it on Amazon. Why is it no longer available?  I will have to look for it in stores but I have a bad feeling I won't find it there either."
390,B000Y8X0LE,"I’m in my 30’s and I’ve struggled with combination, dry skin, oily skin, and acne for years and every product. I seem to use only aggravates the problem and makes it worse. I got this product only a few days ago, and instantly I see results! Acne is fading. No rash no dry flaking skin! I've used this face cleanser for a few years now and am glad it is still available and has not changed. Used with the Hawaiian moisturizer, it's a nice way to take care of your skin. Love the alba face washes. Have orders many times from Amazon before but this time instead of shipping wrapped up or bagged to prevent leaks they were just loose in the box. The bottles rolled around opened and leaked. Not a happy customer! The product itself is great. It’s for my tween daughter and it does not aggravate her skin, smells great, and is one of the best I’ve tried for her. The issue is the shipping. I have purchased this I believe 4 times now the 1st time I never received it at all, the 2nd time I did receive it but it had I pened during shipping so it was a mess, is the 3rd time was no issue and the 4th time the same situation where it opened and was a mess. They do not offer any type of return or exchange so I have to wash off the bottle and hope not much has come out if I want to continue using this product. I wish they would work on shipping the item better. My husband and I use this everyday.  It makes our skin feel clean and refreshed.  Highly recommend. This product is very light and works well for my sensitive skin. It is non drying and smells wonderful without being “perfumey” I have a tendency to use too many harsh products on my face that cause it to dry up and break out. I purchased this because it was all natural, and also because I felt that even though it wasn't an exfoliator (with little beads or granules), the pineapple enzyme still gave me a deep clean that didn't dry out my skin, though I always use moisturizer on my face regardless. Because I do have sensitive skin, I use this at night to remove makeup and any environmental residue (smoke, smog, etc), and then I use something even gentler, like Cetaphil, in the morning. Like some people said, a little bit goes a long way.What I really love about this product is that it is completely and totally cruelty-free. It has a the Leaping Bunny logo on the back of the bottle, which indicates that NONE of their products undergo animal testing during any phase. This means that neither Alba, nor its parent companies, nor any of its suppliers, test on animals. It also means that they do not sell their products in countries that test on animals (such as China). While this might not be a deciding factor for some people, it was for me. It's not always easy to find cruelty-free products (ie: Leaping Bunny certified) in a store like Duane Reade or CVS, so when I came across this and really liked the results, I was very happy that they did not test on animals.I know someone did say that it burned their eyes a little bit and that it had a bad smell. I've personally never experienced either of those and was surprised to hear that. So much so that I went as far as emailing Alba on their site to inform them of this because it seems odd that a bottle would smell great to one person and smell like rubber to another. I always close my eyes when I wash this off my face and honestly do not experience any stinging. I've used this cleanser in rotation with others for many years now. It's a generous size, smells like you're on a tropical vacation, and is gentle on sensitive skin."
391,B001E77OUM,"Using EO for 10 years and best hand soap for my hands. Mo chafing or dry skin. I love this hand soap & it is not drying to the skin. It smells great too. I like this soap and bought 3 small bottles to use around the house and now I finally decided to get the refills. The scent is nice but not too strong and it doesn't linger for long on your hands afterwards (this is a good thing!! Too much perfume in a product to make the smell last on your hands means more chemicals) and it's gentle enough to use often and it won't dry out your hands.The only gripe I have with these refill bottles is the cap. If you squeeze out the product through the cap opening, you'll notice that the soap product will spill out around the sides when you push it down to close it. This isn't a deal breaker for me though, but if you don't want to end up wasting product or time by wiping off the product and rinsing the cap I suggest just taking the whole cap off altogether and pouring out the soap to the other bottles instead of through the cap.As other reviewers have said, the consistency of the soap is also a bit dodgy; when you push down on the dispenser (smaller bottles, not on this refill bottle) and pull your hand away too fast you might not catch all the product in your hand which makes it spill. Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me because I just learned to make sure all the product is in my hand before I pull away so it depends what your tolerance/patience level is with such types of packaging. Overall still a great product with great value for the price on Amazon. I searched high and low for this scent. I had bought these cute dispensers from Marshall’s and was so sad when they ran out but of course Amazon came in clutch!! A lot for the money and smells so so good!! I bought this awhile back as my bathroom handsoap and later purchased the refill bottles. I like the scent, and the original bottle is easy to rinse off so it looks new - it doesn’t get grimy as can happen with some refill bottles. I’ve washed my hands a lot this year (hello, 2020!) and it doesn’t over-dry my hands, even in winter - though I also use hand lotion quite regularly.  Good stuff. I love this soap.  This is a fantastic deal for this soap as well!  I put this in the dispenser that is attached to my sink and use it whenever I wash my hands, which is often since I'm an RN and wash my hands throughout the day just because I'm somewhat of a germ-a-phobe.  You do NOT need products that ""kill"" germs when you wash your hands...you just need to WASH your hands.  Studies are now showing that these soap products are not as safe as they one were though to be.So, I'm gradually switching everything I use on my body and in my  home to safe, low toxin, products.  This fits the bill!  It smells SO good, too.My hands are soft and are in much better condition compared to the awful Method Soap I was using prior to this.This is a great price and makes this affordable.  Highly recommend! I'm a gardener and pet owner who is always looking for an all natural soap that does a great job of getting my hands clean without irritating them, even if I wash them many times per day.I'm sorry to say that EO Hand Soap fell short of my expectations.  I will say that it smells wonderful, is gentle on sensitive skin and would probably fantastic for ""light duty"" hand cleaning.  However, for those of us who like to get our hands in the dirt, its cleaning power leaves something to be desired:  when it's pumped out of the soap dispenser, it tends to fall in a glop that doesn't suds up easily.  I found that the soap glop tended to slip right of my hands and go down the drain while I was trying to scrub it into my hands.  As a result, I used up this soap very quickly and it wasn't a very good value for me.Even when I could get it to stick around long enough to scrub my hands with, it didn't seem to do a very good job of it.  The soap felt like it coated my hands, but didn't cut through grime.  It just coated my hands and washed right off, leaving the dirt behind.Long story short, I switched back to SoftSoap brand hand soap, which does a great job of cleaning my hands, but doesn't have the wonderful eco-friendly ingredients or fabulous smell that this soap has. This is very good gentle soap especially for hard water where you need to apply a lot of soap for it to foam which causes then for hands to become red and itchy. This soap requires very little just 1-2 drops and is very gentle for sensitive skin. Why only 4 stars instead of 5, well although I love the caps instead of pumps, the caps almost always come slightly open at the mouth which leads to a lot of leakage of the soap liquid wish someone would be brilliant enough to put a tape around the mouth of the caps and also ensuring the caps on the bottles are sealed proper and thight not loose."
392,B000K9AGEQ,"Not for sensitive skin. I have tried EVERYTHING, and i mean EVERYTHING, when it comes to anti-aging products. I've used Olay, Loreal, Nutregeuna, Chinese products, Revlon, etc. NOTHING works better than Skin Eternal. It is by far the best anti-aging cream out there. You can do the research on it's ingredients. DMAE, Vitamin C Ester, and CoQ10 are essential in building collagen and reducing wrinkles, firming and even lifting. It works best with the Skin Eternal Serum. I put the serum on first. The serum absorbs very quickly, so I just wait like 5 minutes before putting the cream on. The Serum is a pump, so 2-3 pumps is perfect for the entire face. I massage in gentle upward motions. Then I let the Serum absorb into my skin. 5 minutes later, I apply the cream. The cream is thick, and has a scent to it, but it's such a magical cream. You can feel it working the second you put it on your skin. The improvement in skin texture, brightness, firmness, youthfulness, softness, and plumpness. All these things happen instantly when putting the cream on. It's literally that fast, and amazing. It feels like the fountain of youth. These two products paired with a great diet, exercise, and lot's of passion and happiness equals a beautiful life. This cream will stay with my forever! People compliment me all the time on my skin, and they think I'm still in high-school. An added bonus about this cream is that I dab a bit of it under my eyes, and it brightens, moisturizes, and smoothes my eyes. All you need is a lil bit. I also put this on my lips, and it is the BEST lip plumper I have ever used. It plumps up my lips and puts a rosy color to them. It's great. I don't have to wear foundation when I go to work. I just put some mascara, and blush and my face looks picture perfect. You will not be disappointed. If you're a woman from age 18-100, you need this cream. It protects against aging as well as reverses the signs of it. It's MAGNIFICENT!! I've been using this as a night cream for a couple of years now.  I bought it after seeing a special on PBS about the ingredients in it being really great for aging skin.  I'm 36 and everyone always says there's no way I look that old...could it be the cream? OR are people just being kind? who knows...but I like it and I like the kiwi-ish smell (and I'm one who is usually averse to most fragrances).UPDATE:I wanted to update my review from 4 years ago. I'm now 40 years old and have used this cream every night. I work at a university and students are often shocked when I say I was a student there 20 years ago, they usually think I'm a student their age. I went on vacation to europe this summer and countless people in their 20's were shocked and refused to believe I was 40. I'd point to my gray hair coming in and one guy accused them of being dyed streaks! I had a 20 yr old who was smitten with me and begging me to take his phone#! I'm now noticing the difference between the quality of my skin and lack of wrinkles to others my age and the beginnings of crows feet and other fine lines starting to appear on people my age.  My husband thinks I look better than when I was younger. I can't help but believe this cream is accountable... 2 weeks of using this & my skin actually looked worse- acne & just ugh looking. But I pressed on & figured it was sloughing some nasty layers away. Sure enough by the end of the 3rd week, it looked fantastic! Started getting compliments on my skin & my age for the first time ever. Hubs even told me one day (out of the blue) that I look different, like when we dated! That's 12 years off the ole face!!I also occasionally use the DMAE Serum at night.Best I've ever tried in my 35 years of life!!!Update: onto my 3rd bottle & so many compliments about how I'm ""glowing"". This has never been said to met till now. Seriously, this stuff is GOLD! I use it as my day and night moisturizer & will never ever go without. I love the Source Naturals Skin Eternal Cream for Sensitive Skin. Although, it has some not-so-healthy ingredients, I do love how emollient and moisturizing the cream is to use. I've used this cream for a few years now. I even love the scent.  I had ordered the cream for sensitive skin (yes, I verified it on my order and it was from this page for sensitive skin), but instead I was sent the cream that contains glycolic acid. The glycolic acid form is too harsh for my skin. Also, the product I received has a sharp ammonia or alcohol type of odor. That has not been my experience with this cream when ordered elsewhere. Was surprised at such a short time before this product is expired, concerned about the potency of the ingredients.  Will try this out but in checking to see if this product should be gold in color, found it on on another reputable website, larger size for only few dollars more with expiration out to Aug 2024. This cream smells delicious!  Like pineapples, kiwi and laying on a white sand beach...but I digress.  This has all the good stuff in it and for 1/4 of the price of the so-called top pf the line.  And this WORKS! I use it at night...it's a bit too thick to wear under make up, but it makes a perfect night cream.  In the morning, my skin is soft and looks perfect.  I've been using it for 2 weeks, only at night, on a freshly cleaned face.  I also use a peptide moisturizer first.  This spreads luxuriously and soaks in really well.  The smell is refreshing and delicious!  I'm the type to try everything and anything -- I even tried snake venom (doesn't work)-- this is one cream I will buy again and keep using.  Love it. I used to use this cream years ago. I just purchased it again, but the overwhelming sulfur smell and citrus (to help mask the sulfur) were too much. I love the actives, though. Too smelly for me now."
393,B0019GXOXY,"This is Ralph's wife, BTW.  I tried other vegan moisturizers and did not like them!  I am glad to be using this one again.  They smelled funny and didn't feel good.  This one has a very mild odor, scarcely noticeable, which is great for me as fragrance irritates my sinuses.  It goes on smoothly and easily and leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist all day. I really like this product and plan to continue using it. The ingredients are great and I love the fact that it has added CoQ10, rosehip, flaxseed oil, and calendula. For half a year, I had to use less expensive skin care products and cut down on the items I used due to financial cutbacks. This eventually took a toll on my 33-year-old skin, causing it to become drier and with larger pores, saggier, and wrinkles to form. After trying countless other creams within the same price range, including Burt's Bees, I decided to try this and those problems are slowly but surely fading after several months of use. That's without the use of my usual serums/oils and other products that have worked so well. I also have really enjoyed using products that have fewer chemicals and more beneficial, natural ingredients, as it seems to be improving my skin long-term--though it did take some getting used to.Is it an all-in-one miracle cream? Not really, or at least not by itself and not with immediate results, but the fact that it has good ingredients, is inexpensive, lasts a long time, and does its job has me continuing to use it. I also enjoy the fact that I feel like I'm not only keeping my skin moisturized, but also nourished and with fewer chemicals involved (it is not all-natural, unfortunately, but bears a low level of toxicity). I do believe in switching products up in order to benefit from other ingredients, but this is the one I turn to the most.This is a really thick, moisturizing cream, but it's not sticky, it absorbs well into the skin, and you don't need a lot, which means it'll last a while. I just dab a few small dots along my forehead, cheeks, chin and nose. It's made my skin much more supple and less saggy, pores are smaller, and any forming lines are less noticeable and continue to improve. The paperiness that tends to form around my eyes (no wrinkles yet) is more supple as well, which is something I've always struggled with. It does, however, have a tendency to make my combination-dry skin oily at night and by the time I wake up in the morning, but it's not horrible and usually depends on the weather. If I feel that might happen, I'll switch it up with Mychelle Grapefruit cream or the Maximum Moisture Cream by BWC.Although I am sensitive to smells and perfumes, the light fragrance isn't hard to handle, unlike the Maximum Moisturizing Cream that has a heavy floral scent (I like that cream and use it occasionally, it's just overly scented and a little heavier). Whatever scent is there eventually fades in a few minutes, and it's not half as smelly as Burt's or similar, lacking that herbaceous smell some products have--it smells more citrus mixed with a hint of floral to me. It also hasn't caused problems with acne, short of the hormonal issues I get once a month. During those times, I use the Mychelle Grapefruit Cream, which works great for that, and may top it off with this cream once the other product sets in. I also try to wear sunscreen over this moisturizer when I go outside for prolonged period of time, generally due to the vitamin C.I definitely recommend it to those who like products that are more natural, nourishing, and that won't break the bank, especially if they have mature, dry, or combination-dry skin. Even though I plan to repurchase some of the serums I used before, just for added benefit, I will continue to use this as my staple moisturizer. I also plan to get the body lotion version since this has worked so well on my face, and eventually plan to use collagen and CoQ10 supplements.If you're brand new to using mostly-natural items (like Burts and BWC), but rather are used to lotions like Oil of Olay, you may be in for a bit of a shock due to the thickness and it can take some getting used to. With products like this, you don't need a lot--too much and you will go into grease bomb mode. Start off with a very, very small amount and add more later if you need it. I do a dot on each quadrant. I also love their leave-in conditioner for my Hermione Granger type hair, though that does have kind of an herbaceous smell that fades. :)The full, current ingredients are: Purified Water, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (organic), Glycerin, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Polysorbate 60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (organic), Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Monolaurate, Ethyl Hexyl Palmitate, Linum Usitatissimum Oil (Flax seed) (organic), Rosa Canina (Rose Hip) Oil (organic), Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Extract (organic), Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Extract (organic), Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract (organic), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter (organic), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil (organic), Citrus Aurantium (Sweet Orange) Oil (organic), Cananga Odorata (Ylang Ylang) Flower Essential Oil, Lavandula Hybrida (Lavandin) Oil (organic), Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Oil (organic), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Prunus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum (tamanu) Oil, Squalane (Vegetable source), Coenzyme Q10, Tocopherols, Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Soy Lecithin, Allantoin, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, ethyl hexyl glycerin, Benzyl Alcohol I was excited about receiving  this product expecting a pleasant aromatherapy experience. Disappointed. None of the fragrances come through. It does seem creamy though. Will continue to use it on dry skin and see how it does. Buy it again? 🤷‍♂️ I really had no great expectations when purchasing this cream. I've had very dry skin all my life. And while I have used many different moisturizers and lotions, NOTHING has worked like BWC! I've used moisturizers that left a greasy film, that would leave my face feeling dry like 2hrs later or less, and that have even made my face still feel tight and dry regardless. So imagine my surprise when this product came along. Have to admit I was a bit taken aback by how small the container was upon opening the package. However, as soon as I put this cream on my skin...just WOW!!! It's thick(but doesn't feel heavy), it smells nice(but not overpowering), you don't have to use much(despite size made it well worth the price), and most of all it left my skin feeling hydrated for the entire day! That was what really sold me and caused me to order more. I would go through my facial routine at 6am and by the time I returned home in the evening at 8pm my face still felt hydrated and soft to the touch. This really is the only moisturizer I will ever need! My sister whom has very different skin, oily, has used it and has been singing its praises as well. So much so I had to buy her her own to stop her from using mine! lol It leaves her face feeling clean and not oily or shiny by the end of the days as usually happens to her.Cannot say enough good things about this product! Anyone with dry(or oily) skin should give this a try. I promise you will not regret it! I was interested in this brand and decided to try based on reviews. A few days before it arrived, I had ""ruined"" my complexion by trying 2 different fade creams/illuminators. My whole face was ruddy, and I had these red itchy bumps and little pimples all over my face. Obviously an allergic reaction. I'm 53 and felt like a teenager again, but not in a good way. Thank goodness it, along with the Vitamin C Facial Cleanser, arrived sooner than expected, 3 days after this ruddiness/rash/breakout started. I cleansed my face and applied the Renewal Cream, a little worried that I might react to the essential oils in the products and make things worse, and I couldn't believe the results after one use.  I woke up the next morning to see 80% of my face had not only cleared up, but had a glow and more beautiful tone than even before I reacted to the fade creams. I will say that the renewal cream does not provide enough moisture for me right now during this horrible winter weather...my skin has never dried out so much during a winter...and I use the Olay moisturizer I have on top of the Vitamin C cream.  It works well enough that I may not need another moisturizer in the summer. Not every product will give everyone the same results, and there's always that chance of an allergic reaction, but boy, am I glad I found BWC!  They work very well for me, and I will be trying more of their products. I have been using this product for a few years now. It sinks in instead of being a film on top of my face. The scent is very clean. I think Vitamin C is good for aging skin. I am 67 and have sensitive skin... problems over the years include Basal Cell Cancer, whiteheads, rashes, etc. so I have to be careful what I use on my skin. If you have dry skin and are in the 60's, may not be moisturizing enough for your skin.  Not for mine anyway."
394,B0009F3O18,"These wipes are definitely my favorite. They always take my make up completely off and they are super soft. They don’t dry out my skin like other brands I always use these wipes so I was happy to have a case for them to help retain the moisture The only bad thing was is the box had a big crack in it !! Idk if it was damaged during shipping or damaged before shipping… It’s hard to find wipes that come with a container, so I keep buying these and sometimes refill with other types so I have a line up of face wipes to choose from lol :DOne of my teen daughters has eczema and sensitive skin, and these work great for her. I have aging, somewhat oily skin, and these don’t give me a bad reaction, and they do a good job of making my skin cleansed and not dried out. The smell is very subtle, sometimes I add rose absolut oil to them to feel extra pampered :)I’ll keep buying these, with or without the bonus of the container, these are just perfect! love the velvety feel on my skin the smooth texture soothes the skin as you remove the days make up leaving a damp cool feeling. refreshing! The issue I had with these was they are drying out just a bit as the package goes down. Typically they last longer. Hmmm Feeling very slick and like residue on your face These makeup remover wipes do a pretty decent job removing waterproof mascara and 24 hour lipstick. Good size. Nice thickness. Not wet and drippy. No breakouts. Not greasy. Doesn’t evaporate and dry out before you finish using. Don’t need to wash your face with soap and water after using.  I’m unsure why there’s need to put them in a non-airtight container because the bag/packaging needs to be resealed between uses anyhow to keep moist. Multi-pack is more cost effective."
395,B000GRB3SA,"I had been using another fairly common body wash which started to make my skin itch.  I just figured it had to do with the weather and dry skin and/or my laundry detergent.  But first I wanted to change my body wash.  I purchased this and have not had a problem since. It was a great find! I have been using Ivory body wash for at least the past 6 years and the quality and smell was always gentle and fresh. Now, it smells similar to detergent. I still use it but really do miss the old formula. I love Ivory products they are very clean and pure. One of three popped open inside the (intact) box and the soap all drained out.  So, paid for three and got two.  Only options are to replace and return, but not worth the bother to ""return"" one empty one.Buyer beware... One of the body washes had opened. Love the scent and it doesn’t break me out like most soaps. I do not want to downgrade the quality of Ivory Body Wash; it is a good product. But this vendor sent me six bottles (and tried to charge my account--thank-you Amazon for catching this). So, I give the product four stars and the vendor no stars. Only soap husband will use for his sensitive skin."
396,B00028MLHA,"Sorry, but it was a bit too separated and had to dump it all out and blend it with other stuff to make it usable This is perfect for my aging skin , hubbys too! ! Gives good moisture!! I love using this butter to prevent my stretch marks.  It smells like chocolate which is something i love!  It is very moisturizing for my skin and has prevented any stretch marks so far and I’m already 30 weeks!  The one thing that might be a turn off for some is that it feels like candle wax when it’s cold and in the jar, but as soon as you spoon some out and melt it in your hands or on your body, it feels amazing!  I also recommend it as a massage oil/butter. It doesn’t clump up like some other lotions do. This stuff came in solid form, but after reading everything I could on cocoa butter I wasn't surprised. It smells so good. I love the chocolaty scent, although, I'm a little worried that I 'll smell like a chocolate bar with this on my skin. I did try some of it in places and the scent seemed to die down a bit. All in all I'm pretty satisfied. I will say this, the amount that comes in the bottle is a joke, no fault of the seller though. It's not their fault I had no idea how little 7 oz is. My intention was to use it to make a homemade skin moisturizer. I can go through this in less than a week. I have dry skin so I like to apply lotion liberally. At $8 per jar I would probably end up spending $16 a week which is way to much. While I liked dealing with this seller, I will be looking for someplace where I can get more for my money. I already found a place that sells it at $8/lb (16 oz) almost twice as much cocoa for the same price.How I used it: I pried the cocoa out the can in chunks with a spoon then melted it down over the stove with an improvised double boiler-- simply a strong plastic bowl held over boiling water. I would suggest melting it over very low heat. This stuff melts fast. I made the mistake of putting it over high heat at first and nearly melted it too much. I wouldn't worry if you melt it until it looks like a clear, golden oil. Then I mixed in about 1/4 cup of olive oil and stuck it the freezer to solidify . It wasn't rock hard, but more like a thick cream. It could stand to take some more olive oil to thin it out a bit more, but I ran out. I put it back in the jar in came in for later use. It'll still work for me though. When I take a shower I'll place it under the hot water so that by the time I'm done it'll be nice and soft. Suggestion, especially if you're using to fade dark marks or stretch marks, exfoliate while you're in the shower with a strong loofa. Then pat dry and put on the butter. It'll absorb better and work more effectively.Great product. I find it interesting that people would buy something without knowing what it is. I read that a lot of people were either confused or frustrated about their cocoa butter being hard. Pure cocoa butter is suppose to be hard, it's not like those cocoa butter creams you buy in the store because this is the pure ingredient not mixed with anything else. That being said, I really love this stuff! I found that the fastest and easiet way to get it out of the jar is to simply take either a butter knife or spoon and just sort of chip or scrape some chunks and shavings out a little at a time.I make my own lotions and bath products, so I'll already have the cocoa butter premixed with something else to make it more 'manageable' as a hand cream before I head out. I take the cocoa butter pieces, add something like shea butter or an oil(coconut, mineral, EV olive, etc.), put them all in a glass and melt the entire mixture in the microwave. I than pour the mixture into a seperate travel size container, let it sit for about 30 minutes and voila! A very yummy smelling and heavenly hand and body cream! I take the leftover 'crumbs' still stuck to my hands after chipping the stuff out and just rub them in. I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know, just remember that it's going to be hard :) To be honest I dont know much about cocoa butter, but bought this to put on my pregnant belly.  It did not prevent me from getting stretch marks, but mine are not that bad.  I can't tell if it is helping or not because I have no idea how bad they would be if I didn't use this and I am probably pretty genetically prone to stretch marks.  However, it does keep my skin feeling soft and moisturized.  The only complaint I have is that it is quite hard and has to be scraped out with a fingernail and softened in my hands before rubbing on my belly.  I think that is the nature of cocao butter, but when I purchased I thought the addition of jojoba oil would mean it was softer.  So if you are looking for something more like a cream... this is not it.  I have gotten used to scraping it out and like using it. What in the world is this?! Oily with hard rocks. This is not what I expected from NOW Products. I use the coconut oil and essential oils, but this product was nothing what I expected. The smell was the only good part. Need a refund. When i first recieved this jar of cocoa butter it was/is rock hard and dry. For everyone who hasn't yet figured out how to use this product, read this review it will save you some time and frustration.I cut out the amount of cocoa butter needed from this jar, added it to a heat safe container with coconut oil at room tempurature... I put the container in a pan halfway filled with water, don't fill 2 much or the water will go into your container. With low heat and a few minutes the cocoa butter melted nicely into the coconut oil, so I removed it from the heat added argan oil, grapeseed oil and mixed. Once it returned to room tempurature the mixture was not dry or hard. It melts easily when I want to use it and my skin has never felt better or more hydrated. This works wonders on winter dry hair as a leave in treatment overnight. I've also used this mixture on my face, under makeup and at night. I've noticed smoother, brighter skin and wouldn't trade my oil for any department store product again.Give this oen a try, it's worth it."
397,B00014DM5K,"The toner arrived packaged, and the bottle tightly sealed in plastic. However, I noticed a bit of fluid inside the plastic wrap. Reason: there was no seal covering the opening of the bottle. Do the bottles come without a seal?? I definitely think they should come with a seal over the opening.Aside from that, the toner has met my expectations. It feels refreshing. Light exfoliation. For me the (current) scent is not overpowering, though I’d much prefer the previous fragrance. I love this product and have used it (and the creamy cleanser) for several years. I splash it on my face and inhale deeply for a refreshing experience inside and out! This is the only toner I like for my very sensitive skin. Any slightly nefarious ingredients, especially alcohol, will leave my face red and irritated, so I was happy to finally find a toner that my skin likes. At night I use it after washing my face and it removes the last residue in a very satisfying way. Somehow it really does 'prepare' the skin in a way that makes moisturizer more effective. Sometimes I use it mid-day in place of washing to remove some oil from my face. Adding this toner to my routine seems to help manage my acne. I'm always in the market for a toner that is healthy, affordable yet gentle.  I've ordered this product now several times and have been very happy with it.  There is a very slight scent, but it is not evasive.  I've since ordered other products from Earth Science and am overall very happy with their products.  It's definitely worth a try if you are considering it! I use this toner after washing my face before bed (and before adding the Earth Science Almond moisturizer) and to freshen up first thing in the morning.  I have to say it has almost become addicting!  I cannot sleep until my face is clean and I don't feel fresh in the morning till I have used my toner.  I cannot find this in stores near me anymore so I tried another similar toner (another brand) and it left a film on my face!  This toner does not do that, you feel clean and refreshed.  It is not over-drying (I have very dry skin) and it have evened out my skin tone soo much!  I am fair skinned with lots of freckles and sun damage.  After using this for about 8-9 months I don't have to wear foundation anymore!  I put on a tinted moisturizer, some concealer under the eyes and I am good to go!  LOVE IT I love a couple of Earth Science products—my absolute favorite being the creamy fruit oil cleanser (5 stars for sure). So I was excited to try this toner.I will cut to the chase. I have Rosacea and sensitive skin. I can’t use most products with SPF in them. My skin is also not compatible with foaming cleansers, many exfoliants, and anything that is harsh like salicylic acid.That said the Earth Science products I do already use have been very good with my skin, and have IMPROVED my Rosacea immensely.This toner...I tried it today for the first time. It has a strong fragrance, like really strong, but it did go onto my face nicely. I have found the other items I use from this manufacturer to be very mildly scented, which I prefer due to my finicky skin. Fragrance is often really bad for sensitive skin, so for a product that claims to be for sensitive skin this was a shock for me considering I know their other products.I am gonna keep trying the toner for now but thus far I’m not thrilled about the strong scent or the addition of fragrance. That often is enough to set my skin into a tantrum, which is not fun. Otherwise this product has excellent ingredients and I wonder if it would smell nice on its own!I will report back and let you know if this toner holds up to Earth Sciences record for making my Rosacea/sensitive skin happy.Additionally it was packaged badly. Bottle was in a box with a small air bubble package so the bottle was able to roll around freely in the box, which opened the bottle and about 1/4 of it splashed out. So that was not cool but likely Amazon’s fault and not Earth Science. That said I am going to focus on the quality of the product here and will report back once I’ve used it for at least a week or more.If you find my review to be helpful, especially if you have sensitive skin, I would love for you to hit the ‘like’ button. Thank you in advance. Probably one of the best toners I've ever used. Used daily with no adverse effects. No weird tingle. Makes my dry/combination skin feel refreshed before putting on makeup. Most of all, it does not leave me with dry patches! Since my skin is mostly dry, I'm prone to scaly skin during the winter months. This is a very hydrating toner packed with healing aloe vera that not only refreshes but moisturizes the skin and cleans out dirty pores. I even mix this toner with some almond oil to use as a makeup remover! Very safe, very natural (you can also find it at Sprout's grocery store) and perfect pre-primer toner for a day out. I blot some of this onto a cotton round pad or two and use circular motions on my face AND neck. Thanks for the great product. This stuff is wonderful! My skin has been reeeeeeally negatively impacted (chronic peeling) from a mask I purchased from a Marketplace buyer on Amazon. I tried this toner and could not believe the difference.  I'm really particular about toners and have always opted for a salicylic acid toner as my skin responds well to it, but when I tried this I was more than pleasantly surprised.  I used another treatment that acts as a toner a couple of nights and saw that, sadly, the peeling came back/was still there.  Resuming use of this toner once again helped, but I obviously need a doctor's treatment.  I would recommend people try this toner as it really does have a healing impact; I'll continue to buy it."
398,B0002X4F0Q,"Works great for my son's acne and the smell isn't too chemical, unlike others.  We have it on regular fulfillment.  Be sure to keep it covered if leaving it in the shower or the product will wash away or be absorbed by the sponge.  Too pricy to be wasted! I have used it before and I love it! But now it has a different name, I'm not sure if the product will be the same. I've had a problem with acne since I was a teenager.  Birth control pills have controlled it for many years, but recently I quit taking them so...my skin has been a wreck!  I get cyst-like bumps around my jawline and on my chin.  I don't seem to be able to stop myself from picking them, so they get red/purple, inflamed and painful.  I've tried every over-the-counter remedy I could find.  I was getting ready to go to a dermatologist when my sister-in-law recommended PCA Skin Blemish Control Bar.I can't say enough about how much this has helped my complexion!  You wash your face and leave the lather on your skin for two minutes with the enclosed sponge.  The sponge is a little abrasive (not too much though) and the lather is very creamy and rich.  It's smell is very medicinal, but not objectionable.  You only get two sponges with the package, so you have to reuse them.  I wash my face and then rinse the sponge well.  I keep in on a soap dish with perforations so that it will dry well. The package says you should use twice a day.I started using it twice a day but found that I got way too dry.  I now use it just once a day -- in the shower.  I wash my face and then do my hair while I'm leaving the lather sit on my skin.  I've been following it up with This company/product was unknown to be until I went to get a facial (a treat I bought myself for the first time) The product is amazing. I noticed a difference in just a few days. I have gone to Ulta, Skin Care Mary Kay, Avon, Clean and Clear, Proactive, etc. They all have the same thing in common. They do not balance the pH of your skin, they add things to it. They add moisture, add lotion, add chemicals to help reduce acne, add color to make it look pretty/smell pretty, add granules to scrub skin....none of these things have ever worked for me. I quit wearing makeup because it wasn't making any difference (either it melted off due to extra lotion/moisture, or it caked on causing more acne) I have small dry skin pores (according to the facial lady), but I produce a lot of oil (I know because I live with my face). I have not had the courage to try anything new because it is all expensive and I was tired of it hurting or not doing anything. Once you use the $40 bottle of soap or lotion it is bought and you cannot return it. This one (due to the fact it was at a facial spa place) looked expensive but Oil of Olay was more expensive. $30 dollars for that one jar of soap (called a bar for some reason). All it does is put your skin back to its natural pH. It doesn't try to add or subtract anything to your face, just antibacterial pH soap. My skin brightened, and repaired itself because it was no longer being bombarded by chemicals or lotions trying to change my skin's function. pH antibacterial soap.Wonderful. I ran out, and got frustrated because the facial place was far away from my new residence, so I tried a few more ($40 and $38 and $20) soaps recommended by Ulta or friends. Nope, still didn't work for me. I ordered this soap online and cannot WAIT to use it once more. A picture here of my skin wouldn't do justice. No Shipping and Handling cost, just the $30. It lasted 9 months for me, but they said it would supply for a whole year. <shrug> Nine months is MUCH more than Ulta/Oil of Oley/CVS/Avon/etc products advertized.<relieved> I am glad I can buy it here on Amazon and don't have to go driving around looking for another spa to make my face behave once again. This product is great for acne prone skin and has kept me blemish free since I started using it. I’ll be ordering my next product soon. Use sponge provided for application, to froth the soap and to keep soap longer.Not drying, but effective!"
399,B000MAOWP2,"My sister purchased this product for me years ago. So happy  I  found it again. Serum really is good for your  skin Works well, once a week,  quick 1 min peel. I used this for a year.  It had a tingling at first but as your skin gets used to it, that goes away.  It still made my skin feel a little tight.  The smell is not great but that is the nature of vitamin C and all products smell similar.  It has always arrived a little brownish, never clear.  Not sure if it That meant it was oxidized, but it did seem to work. I  stopped my subscription when I received it and the top was a little loose.  It didn’t fee the same so I think it had oxidized.  It is not worth it to me to buy a product that the company doesn’t invest in by putting a little money into a wrap of some kind to ensure it doesn’t come loose or leak.  It is too expensive to throw away!  I switched to Timeless which is 20% and is clear in color.  It arrived with good packaging, has an air pump to keep air tight, vitamin e, the good kind of vitamin c, and best of all, is half of the price.  It was recommended by Angie from hot & flashy. I also now keep it in the fridge to preserve it as long as possible.  Mychelle needs to invest in better packaging. I've suffered with acne for around 8 years and finally managed to clear up recently thanks to antibiotics and prescription retinol. I've tried other very expensive serums (Lancome, etc) and other vitamin C serums from various brands. I didn't see much of a difference on my skin at all; I thought vitamin C just wasn't for me. I have scarring and uneven skin. I decided to try a sample of MyChelle's 17% serum from the store I work at and I saw my skin overall look better in about 5 days. Less redness and oilyness. I decided to then buy the 25%.My skin is luminous and looks healthier now. I've only been using it a month! I've been getting compliments on my skin as opposed to before. Feels good to find a product that actually does what it claims. It has also been helping my dark circles under my eyes a bit but I don't put too much in that area because it's sensitive.I was using it twice a day but you shouldn't mix retinol and vitamin C because they contradict each other. It caused me to get a few breakouts. I only use this after my day routine now. Retinol at night. My skin is better now and radiant. I store this in the fridge along with my retinol.Like others have mentioned, the pump isn't great. I deducted a star due to this. Vitamin C is very frail, hence why I store in the fridge. I'm wondering if they could perhaps get a better dispenser while keeping the product effective. The pump gets hard sometimes but I've managed to get the appropriate dose so far.I definitely recommend giving this a shot if you can afford it and deal with redness, extra oil, and dull skin. I've never been happier with my skin and it's improving every week now. I use the Perfect C Serum along with other MyChelle skincare products. At first I wasn't sure that I would continue with it, but I quickly noticed a difference after I stopped using the C Serum. I easily go through one bottle a month (if I'm lucky!) so, at $30 a pop, it's just as expensive as the high end C-serum lines. Still, I love the non-toxic MyChelle products and have found that they're as effective as they claim to be. And even though I'm now putting more serums and lotions on my face than ever before, my skin is not breaking out which was an unexpected, and welcome, bonus. Another bonus is that the MyChelle line smells great, not perfumey,  but honest-to-goodness yummy.The one negative, in my opinion, is the C Serum packaging. It would be nice if they sold a larger size with a better dispensing mechanism. The calibrated pump doesn't always dispense a full application and it stops working before the bottle is empty. I've taken to undoing and replacing the cap which seems to help as the bottle gets low. Towards the end, I just shake out as much of the remnants as I can. This stuff isn't cheap so I try to get every last bit of it!Best deals: So far, I've found that Amazon is the best place to buy MyChelle. Their prices are consistently lower than average. You can also get deals on eBay, but you have to work (snipe) for them. MyChelle does not supply expiration dates (they are supposed to be good for 18 to 24 months from purchase), so I prefer to buy from a reputable source. The MyChelle website does have a really good sale every now and then so, if you like her products, you may want to get on the email list.About me: I am a 48-year old grandmother of three and in the past three months, since I began using the MyChelle line, I've been carded twice and have received numerous compliments about my ""glowing"" complexion. I followed the suggestions on the MyChelle website and I'm using the My aesthetician recommended this to help fade my malasma and it WORKS! Nothing else that I've tried works but the components in this cream do work. The scent is what I'd call brown sugar and I don't like it but it fades quickly. I still use my moisturizer on top."
400,B000OP3DIM,"This balm is okay but I have had better. The smell is what throwing me off. I’m sensitive to air. This balm is a dream come true!! My absolute favorite lipbalm I decided to try something new and I LOVE anything coconut so I thought why not? First off it smells like coconut, the balm goes on smooth and has a light sweetness to it and I like the fact that the base is bee's wax. I will continue to use this in addition to my regular brand but overall it's a great buy and a great lip balm! If you like coconut, give it a try! A friend gave me this lip balm in ""renewing passion fruit nectar"" which had a pleasant subtle scent. The perfect texture and the 100% vegetarian ingredients was the first genuinely-great-quality-lip-balm I've come across. I found it on Amazon (Target has Alba products but not their lip balm!) and ordered the ""nourishing coconut cream"". It also smells nice and has the same texture. I have an issue with losing lip balms but I try my best to keep these two around for as long as possible. :) I love this lip balm and have been using it for around 10 years. It is the only lip balm that thoroughly quenches my dry lips and doesnt taste like soap! Inevitably some lip balm is going to get inside the mouth when using it, and this is fine as it tastes like coconut which I love! Not only that but the ingredients are safe - its not loaded up with chemicals like most.  Its the perfect lip balm and I hope it never gets discontinued.... I simply cant go without it, and have never found a lip balm as awesome as this one! This lip balm is the BEST one out there! I have tried so many lip balms including Burt's Bees and I swear by this one. This is a coconut lip balm which really moisturized your lips without making look ""greasy/sticky"". I love the smell of it but it's not strong. You only need to apply it once or if you have really dry lips then maybe twice a day and it keeps your lips moisturized all day. I highly recommend this product----and for it being an organic product it is reasonably priced. The lip balm's smell is a little bit like artificial flavors which makes the coconut smell of the lip balm kind of nasty. When I applied it on my lips, it was like really greasy, but it does moisturizes the lips for a long time. This is an okay lip balm since it's so greasy and mushy and the taste is okay. But really fast shipping. Took only 4 days to come."
401,B001CL9XIQ,"I purchased this item specifically to treat the area around my eyes, especially my eyelids. The skin on my eyelids had become pretty dark after I used an eyelash growth product. I stopped using the eyelash growth product and began using the stonecrop serum because I thought it would be safe for the eye area, in comparison to most skin-lightening creams which would not. After about 6 weeks of use, I notice that my eyelids have lightened quite a bit. I believe this is a result of the serum, and probably not just because I stopped the eyelash growth product, as there was actual darkening of the pigmentation.  I have fair, sensitive skin and I have never experienced any irritation whatsoever and no adverse skin reaction, burning, etc.  I am able to apply moisturizer over this serum (after allowing it to settle in for a few minutes) and wear it under makeup, even with use of a make-up primer.  The product is not oily at all and sinks in pretty quickly.  I have also used this product on other areas of my face to try to even out the skin tone (my skin tends to be a bit sallow), and have not seen as much progress there, but I will continue  to use it because I know it does decrease dark spots.  Used the serum consistently 2x/day to achieve this result. If the serum had helped more with overall skin tone, I would have given it 5 stars. I have been using the Stone Crop Serum each night for a couple of months. I just ran out and immediately reordered! I has helped with the hyperpigmentation as well as reviving my dry, dull previous appearance. I have always hated waking up to my no make up-uneven-blotchy skin, and I no longer have to! I will likely never have a flawless face with my skin type but feel like this has already gotten me closer than I thought possible. I do still have some dark spots, it's not quite magic, but they have began to fade as well. It's a fantastic product!*I use this with the Stone Crop Gel Wash and the combination is likely the contributing factor to my new healthy skin. Every Eminence product I've used has been awesome. This keeps my adult acne away - especially under my jawline. Worth every penny and I will continue to use this product. It works very well with the Stone Crop cleanser which has a nice clean smell and also makes my skin feel really smooth. A little goes a long way and I always mix it with a small amount of water, which makes the product last all the longer. You really can't go wrong with Eminence products. If you want to go organic on your skin, then the Eminence line is what you want. I used Lancome for  years and was completely satisfied with my skin using  their products. A few years ago I realized how many chemicals are in skin products that have very nasty side affects with long term use and decided to go organic. It took about a month for my skin to adjust to the new regime but I am more than satisfied with all of the Eminence products. Would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to stop polluting their bodies with chemicals. I am using this serum along with four other serums. And I can't say which ones are working or if it's the combination of all serums but I feel that my skin is looking so much better and starting to glow beautifully. I had so much acne and scars and slowing they are fading and my skin is smoothing out. I'm so glad that my skin didn't get so damaged when I had acne. I plan to keep using eminence products because they are organic, chemical-free, gmo-free, and they just smell awesome! I Love Eminence!!! I have very sensitive skin and perioral dermatitis. This whole line of the stone crop products has SIGNIFICANTLY helped improve my skin within the two weeks I have been using it. I already get compliments on my skin after two weeks!! I'll be a lifelong customer. I've tried so many products ranging from cheap drugstore products to expensive department store products and this has totally won. Hands down. I think the Eminence Bright Skin Licorice Root Booster-Serum lightened my sun spots more quickly, which is what I was looking for, but over time this also worked and gave my skin a nice even tone. Eminence Stone Crop keeps my senior skin soft and helps with the dark spots.  I love this"
402,B000BKXGXW,"The directions are easy to follow and makes enough for one mask. This red clay mask is much more gentle then the green clay, but still cleans deep. No artificial ingredients or fragrance. My face does not like artificial ingredients so this mask is a lifesaver when there are so many countless masks claiming to do the job and ultimately make me break out afterwards. I use a ceramic cup and a plastic utensil to mix, and a foundation brush to apply the mask. Ive had funky results with other clays using metal utensils to mix causing lumpy texture. I have had no issues with this clay. Reasonable price too. Fast shipping. I’ve ordered multiple products from this company with no issues. I was just curious about this red clay and, I never, ever thought, that one day I will be reviewing a mud.I had masks before at local barber shop and wanted to try some minerals. I am a male past middle age, between olive and wheat complexion. I have tiny wrinkles under my eyes and around my upper lip and lower part of my neck, which are normal signs of aging. My pores used to look like the skin of an orange, shiny and oily for a long time.I must tell you this first: Do not apply this mask too thick. I will tell you later, why? 1 tbsp for face and neck is plenty. Adding spring  water, while stirring, mixed, until it is a runny hand lotion. I started smearing it starting from my forehead, around eyes, (not too close to the eyes), cheeks, chin and neck. After finishing putting the mask on, I figured, I lay down for 15-20 minutes, like the label says (note. Label does not say to lay down). I was very relaxed. Within a minute pulsations started around my cheeks, parallel, my left and right side pulsating at the same time with the same tempo of my heart. This clay maybe accelerating circulation. My face feeling like someone is pulling it back, I think, it is normal... the mud is drying. Closed my eyes and gave all my attention to these tiny pulses moving around my cheeks. Then tiny stings began below my cheeks, near the base of my nose. This stings were like a low voltage current penetrating my skin, and moving around very fast, pulses much finer than the ones around my cheeks. I am amazed that a mud is doing this... I got 10 more minutes, When I move around I don't feel anything on my face other then pulling. As soon as I lay down and relax, pulsing and stinging comes right back. Can I wait 10 more minutes?My face feels hot suddenly, for 10 seconds. Stings are now around my upper lip, It feels like running a micro needle roller there. There is a slight burn at the contour of my upper lip. I think: this is working! I have 5 more minutes, I feel my lower eyelids being pulled down and I can't wait to see what this stuff did to me? Pulsating still continues on my cheeks at the same tempo. I get up to wash my face, and look in the mirror. I see my cheeks are still wet. I put way to much there and that explains why this mud was so active there. I wash my face and try not to splatter the red stuff allover the place. Although it washes right off and leaves no stains.Results: I am blushing like I just came out of sauna. My cheeks so red and  glowing. Looking closer I notice my pores are flat, pumped out and looks like irritated. My skin feels firm, tight and thirsty. I  quickly apply my H2O Night Oasis Oxygenating Energizing Serum. This is the only product I've been using the last 10 days or so. It is also great after shaving. I am just hoping that the redness will go away. I go to sleep and next morning, my cheeks are pink. Tiny wrinkles under my eyes are stretched and gone. Above my lips, tiny wrinkles, they're still there but not so visible as before. Looks like a  little swollen. No more orange peel skin. I call my sister-in-law to see the difference, if she notices anything. Yes, she says, confirmed. She wants me to order one for her immediately. I am so glad, and happy I've tried this miraculous product. Next time I am going to roll in it. In the tub of course. I should have taken before and after photos. But I will add them next time. Although I want to keep my skin in this condition forever.PLEASE, comment on this and let me know about your experiences here. This is not the end of this review. It will continue... I just received my first order of Now Foods Moroccan Red Clay Powder and from the first use, I know this is a staple item I will not be without.  I am 42 with extremely oily skin/large pores/prone to breakouts. I have always used various masks and this is by far my favorite.  I mixed it simply, per the instructions on the lable, only I used apple cider vinegar (I hate the smell, but it is good for my oily skin) instead of water.  It started bubbling and a little smoke came out of the bowl and I thought, this is like a science experiment from high school, lol! The clay dissolved immediately into a smooth, silky texture. I applied it to my face with a plastic brush I found in my bathroom and let it dry for about 20 minutes. I splashed my face generously with warm water for a minute or so, followed by a cool water splash and that was it. I can honestly say, that this rinsed off my skin easier than any other clay type mask I have ever used. My skin felt and looked great. I had read some reviews online that some people had a hard time getting this off their face after it dried, it stained their washcloth, it stained their skin, etc. I have extremely pale, paper white skin and it did not leave any kind of stain whatsoever. I wiped my face (after rinsing) with a white/floral washcloth and the small amount that was on the cloth rinsed away with warm water also. Everyone's results will be different, I am sure, but for this price, I would DEFINATELY try it if you are interested. I have teenage daughters who have some of the same skin issues I have and I have been researching homemade remedies online for a while now. I love that this mask is great, as is, but will also make an excellent  base for me to add other ingredients to, depending on what our skin needs are that day.  I have read that this can be mixed with aloe vera gel, lemon juice, witch hazel or essential oils for drier skin types. I am also going to try mixing some cinnamon or nutmeg in here too, as I have read they are good for acne also. Overall, I could not be more pleased and I feel that this is a wonderful, gentle, cleansing mask that can be used by anyone and/or adjusted to meet specific skin needs. Good Luck! Very nice, but not so sure about is mixing qualities love it - good product La compre porque suelo tener cara muy sensible a todo y me encanto no tuve ninguna reacción alguna y eso que tengo lupus"
403,B00014D138,"Really great and amazing moisturising cream. It is very rich, felt some tingling at first but it didn't last for long, It faded at the moment't really works beautifully. It did't leave my skin dry after wash nor did it give the slippery feeling  when contact with water. I gave for stars for the packaging, It had a plastic lid under the plastic cap which is fine, and I think that it might have been better if the cream was in a tube for hygienic reasons only. Other than that. It's great. I purchased this product after doing some research on moisturizer with multi vitamins. There are not a huge selection out there to begin with when I didn't want to spend a fortune, need a product with several vitamins, and also does what it is supposed to do. I used this after gentle clensing and spraying facial water in the AM only. My skin type is acne proned, combination with a little bit more on the dry side, and very resilent. I have no complaints other than the fragrance that is in the product, I would give this a 5 if it's fragrance free. I'll keep using this until I find something better. This is a WONDERFUL cream and the best bargain you can find.  It's a big jar and the cream is, to my mind, a very high quality, rich and all ""natural"" blend.  Since it is so affordable I am using it all over and that is something you can't really do with most moisturizers.  I like being able to use it on my heels, legs, arms and neck and then face.......same hands, same glop of cream.Honestly I'm not prone to excessive enthusiasm about ""products"" of any kind, but really , this cream is the find of a lifetime and I plan to keep buying it.  By the way, it does have a scent but it is light and fresh smelling and not perfumy at all.I think this stuff is a real find!!!!! This is an amazing product for your skin! People can't guess my age! I have used all kinds of products for much higher prices and not gotten such pretty skin. This is my go-to-can't-live-without every day face and body cream. I apply it after I rinse my face or take a bath to lock in the moisture. It keeps your skin moist and supple and seems to lower any swelling and redness as well as minimize wrinkles. If my skin needs extra help, I use it together with Jason's 20% vitamin C creams or their Hyper C serum (is a booster in minimizing wrinkles and erasing sun and acne spots fast). I get amazing results for a great price. I love Jason products! It is not the Tea Time that I used to order.  So disappointed, it makes my face sting.  It is very sad that  ""natural"" companies mess with a good thing and become like everything else out there.  I miss the organic ingredients and the trust that I had for the product. this creme goes on real easy, it thickish.  what i do not really like is its fragance, it lingers for about 2 hours.  its not a bad 'smell' but i don't like it.  whether it works or not that i can't say.  i use it on my neck which is 66 yrs old. I would say I'm quite particular about moisturizers.  I don't like anything greasy, sticky or smelly. I wanted something more moisturizing than a lotion for my combo. skin,  that was also non-comedogenic and cruelty-free. This is perfect.  It just feels creamy, not greasy or sticky.  It has an herbal-type fragrance that I find pleasant (Sort of reminds me of Irish Spring), although I could see it being a bit strong for some people.  The smell doesn't linger though, and it moisturizes well.  Great choice.  Now one of my favorites. I just received this from Amazon, and it is assuredly NOT what is shown here as the USE-TO-BE Jason / Organics.  Jason has removed ALL references to anything 'Organic' (with the exception of a couple of small ingredients listed as such individually)I of course immediately went on line to research this, and apparently a big chemical company has bought them and has reformulated (regardless of what they say) whatever 'Natural' elements that there may have been.  I have in the past been quite a loyal Jason product person, but I will most certainly NOT use their products any more.Very sad really..."
404,B000E3BZUW,"I am nearing 60 with olive skin, and large pores on my face. I've had an oily face practically all my life with shine in the T zone until around 45. Therefore, to me, face moisturizer was the last thing I wanted to use on my face, especially creams because they are way too heavy. In the last 15 years, I would use oil free serums and somewhat creamy gels to moisturize. My regimen is more like, whenever I feel like taking care of my face. Not regular at all. Now, I still get a light oil all over my face, except I actually have dry patches on my cheeks and outer brow bones. Dry patches....such a foreign thing for me. My face has only fine lines and fine wrinkles, except the worry lines are getting a bit deeper, but I think the oil in my skin has actually slowed the aging process, for which I consider myself so lucky and I am very grateful!!So needing a new face moisturizer, I turned to Alba first. I did research other options, only to buy from Alba in the end, unsurprisingly. This cream is very light and not oily at all! I received it yesterday and after using Alba's pore refining face wash for the first time, I applied this moisturizer. This morning, my skin is still soft and dewy, not oily at all, and it did not clog my pores!! The scent is lovely, light and airy! I also used it on my arms and the back of my hands and fingers. They are so soft and the fine wrinkles at the wrist and on my fingers are reduced greatly! I am so happy with this moisturizer. It is well worth the money!! I can't wait to see it's full benefits long term!! Love that this is pure, unscented, and moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and this feels soft and gentle. I add essential oils for further natural skin care too. It is the perfect carrier moisturizer. I have used Alba products for a number of years.  Had been unable to find this moisturizer locally in the past year and after trying to get by with other brands decided I had to order online.It has a perfect balance of light moisture, and scent.  My skin loves it. It has a fresh scent and the texture is light and silky. love this cream, it's the best substitute for another cream they no longer make or sell.Amazon packages are coming in brown paper padded envelopes with some kind of foam? between the layers. not environmental! not plastic? but what is it? Love this moisturizer. It is silky smooth and non greasy. Well worth it. I use this moisturizer in combination with their face wash and acne pads. I use the wash first, then acne pads, then moisturizer. I have problems with cystic acne, and combination skin. Partially from going off birth control, and PCOS. I also have extremely sensitive skin. This combination after a month of use has helped my skin a ton. The acne I get now is much smaller bumps that go away quickly. Its gentle, and has helped me so much. This moisturizer in specific is very light, has a nice smell. And helps hydrate my skin. It's not greasy like other products, and it doesn't dry my skin out. I have tried so many different products, my most recent peach slices and it just didn't work. It made it worse. Please give this a try, in combination with their other products. If you have similar issues, it might be worth it. Other sellers try to sell knock offs or opened products but this is from the manufacturer"
405,B000QUNEES,"I originally purchased this product through Mary Kay. They no longer carry it, so I was lucky enough to find it on Amazon. I love love this product! Nice lightweight face moisture cream.  I have been using this for years and love it.  Does not clog the pores and leaves a nice smooth feeling on the skin.  At first use, it feels a little sticky, but it soaks into the skin quickly and then feels nice and dry and smooth.  Love this product. I sure wish this product wasn't discontinued.  I haven't found other moisturizers quite like this one yet to replace it (either too greasy or astringent), so I'm thankful someone out there on Amazon still had some to sell!  It's a wonderful ""lightweight-ness,"" and is neither greasy nor astringent to any degree.  My skin says thanks! I love this product.  It isn't greasy and it keeps my skin perfectly moisturized during the day.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who's had trouble with facial lotions in the past (as I have).  I would also get the facial cleanser that Mary Kay usually sells with it. My only complaint is that the bottles aren't the same size and that the moisturizer (which I use more of) is the smaller bottle. I used Aveeno as a facial moisturizer for years, but recently I became frustrated with how greasy it made my skin feel. I was on the hunt for something that left my skin feeling quenched, but not too quenched. This seems to fit the bill perfectly. Just as an FYI, I have combination skin, so not sure how it works for other skin types. Mary Kay Velocity moisturizer is perfect for my skin! I have extra sensitive skin and its hard to find something that won't break my skin out. I was disappointed to find out that Mary Kay discontinued this product. I was glad to find it readily available here and it was shipped promptly. This is hands down the best moisturizer. I absolutely love the lightweight feel of it and it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. I actually mix this with a little bit of foundation for a flawless look - works every time.Also, a little bit goes a long way, so this stuff lasts for a really long time! Very easy on the skin.  I have very dry skin and it works for me.  I am middle aged and I realize this is for teens and those in their 20s but I do like it for the summer because it's not so greasy and heavy as other moisturizers."
406,B0014ZWHZQ,"I've tried a number of different creams that say the can help 'lift your eyelid', but this is the only one that actually lifts my sagging upper eye lids! Specifically the darker red side of cream.  I wish I could but a whole tube of just that! And I wish this product wasn't always out of stock! Whenever I find it I buy multiples.. Fingers crossed they won't discontinue it! This product is great. I have fine lines around my eyes and have used countless products in an attempt to smooth them out, if even only slightly. I have used this product consistently every night for the past several months and am still not done with the bottle. It lasts a long time. I don't recommend using this product in the morning - at least not the under eye cream, as retinol breaks down in the sunlight and will not work. I use this product slightly different than the directions tell you to: I apply the under eye serum under my eyes and around my crow's feet, then apply the upper eye cream over that and on my upper eye. I do this because the upper eye product is basically moisturizer, and it helps counteract any dryness that might be experienced at the hands of the retinol. The result is a moisturized and smooth eye area. As with all antiaging products, they can take eight weeks and even longer to see any results, so I recommend sticking with it even if you are skeptical at first. This item's price and quality is on point and I will never purchase another night time eye product as long as this is being made. I love this product and I have been using it for years. It has become hard for me to find in stores around here so I was VERY happy to find it on Amazon and am writing this review in hopes it will not be discontinued.I give it 5 stars even though I only use the white cream for the under eye problems. I swear it helps the puffy wrinkly stuff better FOR ME than anything else I have tried.I say for me because nothing works the same for everyone.The red cream for upper lids does not work well for me I think it messes up the makeup and I see no positive results from it.I know it is wasteful but I tried the other eye creams from L'Oreal and I do not get the same results.UPDATE...still liking the white cream but the last one I bought had the pump in backwards. White came out of red side and pink out of white.??I think that would really mess with a first time user.I am buying again and hoping for the best. This is my favorite eye cream. I’ve never had a problem with the pumps like others and I’m on my 4th ordered from Amazon. The upper eyelid side is why I tried it originally and nothing else compares. It tightens your upper eyelids quickly. The under eye side works great too. The upper eyelid side I saw results the first time using it. The under eye improved over time. When I was finished my first bottle is when I looked back at pictures from when I started using it and could see a difference. Someone that hadn’t seen me the entire time I used the first container noticed and asked what I was using because I also have been using the Revitalift face cream. I’ve used mega expensive products in the past and couldn’t believe how great the L’Oreal products worked. I tried them after getting samples and I’m so glad I did. They have a nice clean scent and really work at a great price. Cant live withiut this product.I swear by this product!! Seriously, if i stop using, within 3 days my eyes look so bad and i look older!!! Its my number one secret (along with Oil of Olay regenerest)I have very sensitive eyes, anything near and my eyes water, turn red, burn. But not with this. Its one of the only products i can use, but im glad because it WORKS. You have to follow the way the directions show, ( upward outward application) for best results) and i do it immediately after washing my face. Or at least i splash cold water overvmy eyecarea, pat dry, then apply to lockbin moisture.Its a great product which, sadly is now hard to find. I only can find it a Kmart and their prices are high.Here on Amazon, this supplier has the best prices with the fastest shipping.HIGHLY RECCOMEND! I have been trying a variety of eye gels and creams to combat hereditary droopy upper eyelids. This Double Eye Lift contains two creams - a light red one for the upper lids and a white cream for under the eyes. It only takes a very small amount of each for full coverage, so the container lasts for a long time. I don't have trouble with dark circles or crow's feet, so I have been focusing mostly on the red cream for the upper lids. It helps some, but I think the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Eye Treatment is better. Both are light, scent-free and very gentle. Living in the Northeast through winter, and being middle-aged, you need an eye moisturizer.  This product does the trick - I use it every day twice per day.  It feels good.However, no wrinkle change.  But for the price, I did not really expect much.  My eyelids are beginning to droop a bit, this cream does not allay this at all.  Also, crows feet?  No change.  I have been using the creme for at least 2-3 weeks now every day.  Again, however, I am content with it being a moisturizer. This product is no longer available at my local store and I hope it is not discontinued!  I ordered several since I love this product and don't want to be without it!  It is my number one anti-aging product!  After trying many other products this is absolutely the best for tissue around the eyes.  It lifts the upper eyelid and softens the look of puffy or dark circles under eyes.  I've used this for many years and at almost 70 the skin around my eyes look decades younger! I use it after cleansing before moisturizing the rest of my face, applying foundation and eye shadow/liner.  I can tell the difference shortly after applying and it lasts all day."
407,B000KOHRX4,"Para cara y cuello ,, no cumple con 100% de expectativas I actually ordered this by mistake. I thought it was the double lifting eye cream with two creams in one pump.  The red cream goes on your upper lid and the white cream goes under your eyes. I've been using that product on my eyes for years with great results and that's what I thought I was ordering when I ordered this. When the package arrived and I realized this was basically the same thing I had been using for my eyes but that they had created it for a face cream, I was actually happy I had made the mistake. I tried it and I get the same results for my face that I had been for my eyes. I immediately ordered a second bottle (I always stock up on the cosmetics I can't live without). It definitely rejuvenates skin and tightens it. I can feel it working the second I put it on. I am 38 years old and I still get carded for alcohol and no one can believe my real age when I tell them. I think a lot of it has to do with the creams I use, and this one is now a favorite. I use it for wrinkles.  It’s wonderful. It doesn't work like it used to As the title says, I'm a 27 year old guy.  I was beginning to notice small wrinkles under my eyes and the lines on my forehead were beginning to become noticeable, so I decided I wanted to start treating them now instead of waiting until it was too late.  That being said, I'm only 27 so my wrinkles are very minimal and my skin overall is still probably fairly resilient.  I've had pretty awesome results with this stuff.  I've only used it for two weeks, but the lines under my eyes are completely gone.  The wrinkles on my forehead are not visible anymore, either.  Incredibly (and confusingly), for the first time in my life, I have dimples when I smile.  Not sure how that happened, but they're there... never even had em when I was a kid.I'm sure your mileage may vary, but this stuff worked really great with my skin.Edit:  I just wanted to edit to say that the package is a little misleading.  There is really only about a months supply in the bottle (using a very small amount).  I'm not sure why the bottle needs to be so large. I find this product to do what it says. It offers a firming “lift” along with moisturizing, replacing other products I was using, but Revitalift is all in one. Amazon price is good. I use regularly, so this item is in my subscribe and save. At first I experienced difficulty ejecting the red and separate white lotions out of the little spout at the same time. L’Oreal advised to “smack” the container so both lotions Jett together. I now do this each time I use it, just to keep it flowing. I only use two squirts per use:  one for eye area and up, and other squirt for jaw/neck and lower face.At age 72, nothing’s no is a miracle, but I have great results below my eyes and on other wrinkles. I recommend it and will continue to use it. I love this product and Amazon has it at a good price.  I tried it from my local drug store and IT WORKS!  Of course it is not permanent but used as directed there is a noticeable improvement in a week or so.  If you are a person who can establish a routine and can apply this product, you will be pleased.  It doesn't smooth out sagging skin but does ""lift"" areas that need a little reinforcement.  Compared to very expensive products or the ""FREE"" trial offers which put you in an Auto Shipping Loop every 30 days this is a good product at a very affordable price.  Good Luck! No real scent and the product works moderately for anti-aging but the price recently went up to almost three times the cost all over the country after being taken off the shelves in drug and retail stores . I guess L’Oréal decided to be really greedy and make this less affordable for moderate income clients."
408,B00127U7QM,"Wonderful scent. It’s a 3 in one, not much to say Scents are personal. I love the way Energy body wash smells but I know at least one woman I dated who hated it. Like I said, smells are personal. The scents gives me a kick during my morning shower, which I like.The only issue I have is the fact that it leaves my skin dry. In the summer I have to lotion my legs because there is no or very little morsturizer in it. But I should be putting on lotion every day anyway so no real negative.So I like it. I subscribed to it so I never run out. That's my review. Not that good on scent Does this really give me energy? I don't know. I think the mint helps wake me up in the morning. A good product. I usually use one bottle a month. Es buenísimos me gusto mucho Love this stuff. 1) Gets you clean. 2) It has a pleasant smell. 3)My wife likes it. And we're done here. I blame myself for buying this. I should have known from past experiences 3 in 1 soaps are never good, which is why it's two stars, the soap itself is a one star. I bought the nivea men's active clean with charcoal a couple times and I like it, 4.1 out of 5, great musky smell, medium thick consistency and nice lather, one major con is if I don't lotion after then my skin gets super dry, I have skin that a light consistency lotion is great, and the problem of finding a lot of lotions to heavy so I can imagine the dry skin problem being a nightmare for people who need their thick creams and lotions. With the Men's Energy 3 in 1 the dry skin problem wasn't really a problem maybe like a third of how it was/is with the Nivea Active Clean. The smell of the Energy 3 in 1 is the same not similar to but the same as the combination of the soap used to wash your car and Dove dish soap with a splash of mint that I feel was only noticeable because I smelled the Energy 3 in 1 prior to using it and as mint does made my nose hairs stand up straight but that being said the Energy 3 in 1 mint smell was very very mild and overpowerd by the scent of car wash and dish soap, gives me a headache just thinking about the smell. The consistency is light and with a transparent blue color reminds me of car soap. Lather is OK I find myself using more soap with the Energy 3 in 1 than normal because the consistency is so light, like a third more mabye. What drew me in to the Energy 3 in 1 was because when I read Energy and Mint I imagined myself after a workout or after work taking a hot shower with the smell of strong mint overpowering my senses and the mint working it's magic and relaxing and soothing my muscles, basically aromatherapy and relaxing. I got the smell of car soap with dish soap and some mint you could hardly tell was mint, a headache, 3 bottles of headache. Just what every man wants to smell like a car wash and freshly washed dishes. Used the Energy 3 in 1 as shampoo, don't even try it doesn't shampoo well at all as you can expect from any 3 in 1 bodywash product. What's the difference between the Nivea Men's Energy 3 in 1 and Nivea Men's Cool if they both contain Menthol? Anyone know? Please no replies of the Nivea Men's Cool is ICY Menthol."
409,B0016L5AA2,"I love this product. After reading many positive reviews I decided to give it a try. The product arrived quickly and was beautifully packaged exactly as shown. I was anxious to try it right away! Mixing up the face lift was simple and took only moments. The enclosed brush made it very easy to apply. The directions are simple and easy to follow. I sat back and watched a movie while the product worked its magic. You feel a slight pulse as the mask dries and tightens. After 30 minutes the mask rinsed off easily with water and left no residue. I then applied the moisturizer and serum. I use the moisturizer twice a day. It is non-greasy and leaves the skin feeling soft. Since receiving the product I have used it three times and love the way my skin and face feel afterwards. I am 52 years old and look much younger than my age, but was starting to see sagging jowls and deepening smile lines. I had cystic acne in my youth and have many scars on my face which accentuate age lines. I can see a very subtle softening of the scars and the age lines aren't as prominent as they used to be since using the Dead Sea Face Lift Kit. I will continue to use this product in hopes that it keeps working its magic. It's also an inexpensive and safe way to feel great! My skin is not very saggy, baggy or wrinkly. But face it - after 50, there's going to be some wear and tear on your kisser. I'm skeptical of these types of products. The ones which ""work"" always have some sort of drawback (leave a white film behind; crack or distort it you touch your face after it dries). I bought this because of the many great reviews on Amazon.I took some before and after shots of my face during each step. It really did soften it up and gave my skin and very light lines a little plump, plus it looked rather fresh. I didn't feel any pulsing but that's OK. This masque pulls your skin up and back so much when drying, you could only get the same visual effect by sticking your head out the car window with your doggie going 70mph. (No, you won't look like Norma Desmond or Joan Rivers. Your face will relax after the masque is washed off).All and all, it's a thumbs up for me. Certainly the best skin care system I've used since crossing the 50 line. Not at all like the TV huckster stuff. I will continue to use it and after one month will do some more shots of myself. this stuff is amazing, believe me, I am the hardest person in the entire world to please and have fallen victim to commercials, ads, magazines and spent so much money on products that I am embarrassed to say the amount. this is the only thing I have used that actually made a difference. I am 51, been using it for a month now. People say I look ten years younger. I love the way you can actually feel it tightening your face, and yes it is true, you actually do notice the difference after the first treatment. NO LIE. I trust Swisa Beauty completely, and also love their body lotion. Just wish they would get the fragrance ""Joop"" back. It was my favorite. Don't buy this stuff in the Mall, they charge too much, and I don't trust some of them. Get it here on Amazon for great prices or their web site. Its worth the shipping wait, which is super fast. If someone has complained about it they are either lying or have had too many skin problems during their life. This stuff is all natural, and pure. I have been using their products for several years. Teri in Houston, Texas Worth every penny! It really works. It is a serious kit with serious effects. And I am referring to the mask portion of the set. I just finished my first application and was truly surprised at the results. I have used expensive brands to drugstore brands and I am not easy to please in the skincare department. If something does not work, it is going back. Btw, I am almost 58 years of age and by no means a spring chicken. I will definitely purchase again. Wow! The first time I used this product I thought ""I don't have time to sit or lie down for 30 minutes for this to dry."" After getting through the 30 minutes, I couldn't believe my own eyes.  I saw a huge difference and decided that 30 minutes was nothing for what this kit does for your face.  The results were so remarkable that I purchased another Non-Surgical Face Lift Kit for my mother on Mother's Day.  All I can say is Wow!  A must try! The kit should have involved dead sea powder, and an activator, so that you can make a mask. When the package arrived I had the moisturizer, the activator, the serum, but no powder. Just called Amazon customer service, and a new package was at my door next day! Nicely packaged product, looking forward to using it after these reviews. I purchased this kit because of the strong reviews.  When I received it, I saw that the primary ingredient in the mask in ALBUMIN (egg white).  Some people are sensitive to albumin, although not allergic.I followed the instructions precisely, even adding a second layer as directed.  I did not feel any pulsing or throbbing of my face or neck.  The mask pulled DOWN on the outer corners of my eyes and eyebrows.When I removed the mask I was red and blotchy.  I could not have gone to work or gone out in that condition.  But more to the point, there was no difference in the smoothness or tightness of my skin.  I'll be returning the kit.I AM POSTING A PHOTO ABOVE, SHOWING WHAT I LOOKED LIKE AFTER THE TREATMENT. Worked as well as i expected.  I expect to reorder but I did not know a refill kit was available.  One always has too much of the activator left when the powder is gone.  Would be great if one could order individually.  Carmen"
410,B001ET7BF8,"Affordable, quality cleanser with a great smell. I’m 58 and have been using this for probably 10 years. I love this product. It takes off makeup, including my mascara (not waterproof) with a small amount smoothed onto my skin with a little warm water. I’ve tried other cleansers over this time period but  still think this is the best. And it’s a value for the quantity. I also love their jasmine and Vit e moisturizer. This has been my go to for at least 8 years - I hope this never gets discontinued. Great as a second cleanse after an oil based makeup remover but will also remove your makeup all on its own.  I can go right over my eyes and get my mascara off (non-water proof) and it doesn’t irritate or sting my eyes (I wear contacts).  I wish Target still carried this but I stockpile this from Amazon now - I always get compliments on how “smooth” my skin is (I’m 40) and I really think this along with my amazon knock off (foreo device) are the reason - it does have enzymes in it that may be the reason for keeping dead skin away & keeps my skin clear.  Wonderful product with an amazing price - don’t waste $$ on more expensive cleansers that get washed down the drain.  Try this - you will be amazed! We love this face wash and it’s hard to find for some reason. Shipping was fast, but poorly packaged. One little piece of tape over the spout didn’t stop them from leaking all over the box and paperwork inside. Such a mess! I received this on Sept. 8, 2017, and am still using the first bottle.  It came with 2.  I use it every night when I go to bed.  I take my eye make up off with another product but just using this will take off the rest of my make up free & clear with no residue.  It's very moisturizing and half the time I don't feel the need for any extra.  I rinse with warm water and then cold.  You only need about a quarter size amount.  It works up into a good lather, not a lot, but enough and when you think you need to get more, don't, just move it around and it seems to lather up again or reproduce! :) I will never wash my face with anything else again.  Next paycheck, I'm trying another one of their products! LOVE this stuff! I've been using Alba Botanica Pineapple Enzyme Facial Cleanser for several years now and it always does a great job and leaves my face feeling refreshed. This was my first time ordering this cleanser from Amazon and while it still works great, I have noticed some differences between this product and the one that I buy at Whole Foods or Target. First, the smell is different, not bad, just different, as well as the texture. I saw that a couple of people mentioned that it hurts their eyes, and I have to agree with that. I don't ""wash"" my eyes, but occasionally the cleanser will run into my eyes while rinsing and it definitely stings, which has never happened to me with this product before. I don't know why the formula would be different, but it seems like it is. But, again, it still works great, and if you can deal with the stinging eyes then it's great deal. I just thought it was worth mentioning that it isn't exactly like the product that I'm used to. I have combination skin that’s sensitive. It is mostly extremely dry, flaky, and feel like concrete on most of my face. But my t-zone is both extremely oily AND Flaky. Especially around my eyes and lip. I use this as a final face wash. I wash my face twice. First with a stripping face soap and then then with the Alba. My redness and irritation is greatly reduce and my skin feel extremely smooth all over and soft in some areas. But most importantly, no flakes!!! I have been able to reduce the amount of oils and lotions I use on my face thanks to this soap. I LOVE Alba Botanica products for SOOO many reasons, including CRUELTY-FREE and PARABEN-FREE offerings. I use their Coconut Milk Facial Wash for my face & also for my nethers! It's a real treat for dry skin. My skin loves ALBA like my mouth loves Ice Cream!I bought the Pinapple Enzyme cleanser once when my source was out of stock on the coconut cleanser. I like the fragrance, but I agree with the reviewer who reported that it burned the eyes like crazy! So much so that I had to stop using it for my face. I have combination skin and the Pineapple product leaves my skin clean, but tight & dry outside the T-zone.HOWEVER, having recently spent a lot of time in Arizona wearlng open shoes in the heat & dust, I have found that this product is AWESOME for removing grime from your feet! I also like it as a handwash. So I'm keeping it in stock for those uses!"
411,B000XY9LT4,"This was a good find, as I have very sensitive skin. The skin on your eyelids is the thinnest skin on your whole body, so you must take good care of it. Keep them hydrated so they stay smooth and don't wrinkle so fast.My eyelids began to feel so dry - bc they were. Yikes. Getting older has it's concerns.My Dermatologist mentioned that this was a great lotion for dry skin. So, I began using this Eucerin intensive repair lotion on my eyelids and below my eyes, just before bedtime and in just days, I saw and felt a real difference.They were softer to the touch, less itchy, and no flakes either. No fragrance, very light to the touch.  The Eucerin co has been around for years; and for good reason.  It works.I don't care if you're 20. Start taking care of your skin NOW. Use nightly, or daily -where ever needed. Something has changed in the last year.  I am having leaking around the pump and the spring is rusting therefore leaking rusty,  messy lotion around the bottle neck. I have to keep cleaning off with tissue. It is not appealing to look at even in the relatively small amounts. Also the pump does not work as smoothly as it used to.  I tried everything to try and figure out why this is happening.  At first I thought it was a one time occurrence but it is not. I bought this as a replacement for a similar product from same company.  Ingredients have changed some so hope it works.  Was expecting Amazon to send an intact bottle but not the case with this bottle.  The spout is broken into lots of small pieces and is unusable.  I will have to reuse mine from the old bottle as this one won't work at all. The delivery box was packed well, but somehow the spout was destroyed.  There was also a gripper label around the spout to help stop spills.  The other bottle arrived just fine with no gripper label but the pump wasn't closed .  Could have been a major mess over all the other things packed in the shipping box. At this point I need a subscription for this lotion. I have switched between several lotions; for moisturizing, hydrating, and lasting wear; this one has proven every time to do what it describes it does. My favorite lotion that leaves your skin soft, moisturized. A slight smell but not aggressive. Reversed my dry skin and when I forget to reapply daily, my skin still remains hydrated. The perfect moisturizer, especially for heavy melanin skin. You certainly will not be ashy after 30 minutes after application unlike most lotions leave you. You'll have a shine that looks like you put on Vaseline. We live in Miami and our skin really suffers when we travel to cold dry climates. This kept or skin hydrated, reduced any itchiness associated. Clean smell, no fragrance. Didn’t leave our skin oily or break out. Really healed any iritation. Very good product. My wife’s therapy recommended this product. Has done a great job on her dry lower legs LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion!  It is thick and creamy.  My skin drinks it right in without leaving a greasy residue.  It keeps my elbows, hands, and feet soft to the touch.  If you have very dry or sensitive skin then this is a great product."
412,B000BRPMJG,"That’s great, I love Sebamed. I use some of their products for a very long time. I wanted to give a chance to this body moisturizer. It is great light texture, soft, it’s great on my very sensitive skin. But I can’t believe about the scent! Very strong powdery rose smell. I wish it would smell like “liquid” or non-scented. I saw the rave reviews and decided to purchase a bottle.  Since I'm pregnant I'm having really itchy skin which breaks out into rashes easily.Maybe it's the bottle I got or they recently changed their formula but my lotion feels like liquid milk.  I have to shake it around just to have it mixed a little but I feel like I'm putting milk on my skin.  It's VERY liquidity.  I don't know if other people are experiencing this but that's how my bottle is.It take a while for the liquid to dry and get absorbed into my skin.  Now is it helping with the itchiness?  Yes, kind of.  But I wish it was a little thicker and not so watery.  I have to be careful pouring it out of the bottle or else the liquid just runs everywhere.=======Added 5/25/2012I just purchased a new bottle and it's completely different than the old one.  The lotion is a great texture and it goes on wonderfully.  Maybe the vendor on Amazon sent me a really old version but the new one I just purchased from the pharmacy is amazing. This lotion works for anyone , but for those of us with underlining issues it works wonderful, If you have problem skin that other lotions do not keep your skin soft and smooth this is for you , I sometimes suffer from eczema or other conditions. Try this you should not be disappointed, Seba Med Has a whole line of Products. I just ordered the Face Cream The Price is right for what you are getting I am very Satisfied.... Thank you Love this stuff!  It's light and moisturizing without being greasy.  It's a great ""after shower"" body moisturizer.  Absorbs quickly so you don't have to wait for it to be ""rubbed in"" before getting dressed.  It's great in cooler dryer weather.  Keeps your skin from becoming flaky and itchy. I wish it had a sunscreen in it so I didn't have to apply a second layer of lotion after using it. I bought this for my 6 year old daughter whose eczema had recently flared up. I've tried SO many other lotions, creams, medications, ointments, herbal remedies, oil, etc! 99% of lotions would sting or burn her when we put them on. I was hesitant to try this because it does contain parabens I believe and parfum. However, I'd read so many great reviews so had to give it a try. It does not sting or burn at all, rubs in nicely - no greasy residue either. seems to help keep her eczema under control without medication (we also follow a diet, don't just rely on a lotion). But anything that keeps her moisturized and doesn't irritate her skin is 5 stars to me! It does smell of perfume, but not in an unpleasant way.  It's a lot more aqueous than most lotions I've used, which makes it feel a little less moisturizing after it's absorbed/dries.  I don't think it's rich enough for the drier winter months, but it's definitely sufficient otherwise as a regular lotion.  I enjoy using it after shower, the scent smells clean.  My skin does feel nice and soft, but it's more of an acute effect and doesn't over time change the quality of my skin. Love this lotion.  It doesn't feel greasy. Love this product"
413,B000TADQDO,"Ok, so several months ago I realized that I was overweight, had zero energy, and was just generally sick all the time.I decided to start making moves toward living a more healthy and (mostly) chemical-free lifestyle.  I started using more homemade products, like honey, & baking soda (instead of shampoo), apple cider vinegar & water (instead of conditioner), coconut oil, cornstarch, baking soda, and tea tree oil (instead of deodorant) and coconut oil (instead of lotion).I don't mind being a little crunchy, but I really don't want to SMELL like it though.  Instead of getting out of the shower smelling like perfumed bath products, I came out smelling a bit more natural.  (This isn't a good thing as far as I'm concerned.)  But I didn't want to ruin my new healthy living lifestyle by spraying perfume all over myself, when I have no idea what's in it.  (My favorite (Shalimar), apparently has anal secretions from beavers!!!!  WHAT??!)So in search of something that would make me smell good, without spraying a ton of perfume on myself, I decided to try the Monoï (pronounced Mah-noy) oil, scented with Vanilla.  I was a little apprehensive when I got it, because the smell is very strong out of the bottle.  Someone said it smells like marshmallows, but that's not quite right.  Pina colada's is a little closer to the smell to me, but that's not exactly it either.  Frankly, I really can't accurately describe the smell.Since it's coconut oil, it will turn white and hard if it gets too cool.  I took it into the shower with me, and it was back to liquid by the time I got done with the shower.  I rubbed it all over my body, and then ran my hands through my hair.  The smell was kind of strong when I put it on, but by the time a few minutes had passed, the oil had completely absorbed into my skin, leaving my skin and hair silky silky soft and smooth, without being greasy.  Within half an hour or so, the smell had faded enough that it wasn't too strong, it just smelled perfect.I can't get over how good I smell!  My father threatened to steal the bottle and pour it on his ice cream.  Strange men are walking up to me, asking me what perfume I'm wearing.  I love it.Soooo... you're probably wondering why the 3 stars, if I love it so much?Welllll... the whole reason I'm using it is so I don't have to use perfumes that I have no idea what's in them.  And when I bought the Monoï oil, I thought that it was coconut oil infused with vanilla beans.  But instead of telling you WHAT it's perfumed with, it just says the ingredients are coconut oil, Tiare flower, ""Parfum"", & Vitamin E.  Well, I know what coconut oil, Tiare, and Vitamin E is.  What exactly is Parfum?  What is it made of, where does it come from?  Is it safe to add it to my lip balm recipe?  I just don't know.  Soooo... this is getting 3 stars. I have been using products from this company for 30yrs. They consistently have a beautiful scent and feel. The people who show pics of mold do not understand that it is not mold, it is parts of the flower that settle in the oil. Every bottle has some in it. I remember this product being on the market for quite some time now as a kid a remember the divine smell of it when my step sister used it.For the past 2 years ive been ordering it from time to time but recently very often.I love coconut oil and the health benefits of it is amazing! Whether for your skin or hair this product is ideal!What tops it all is the super nutty smell of it! Usually pure coconut oil doesn't have a smell, but the the hint of Vanilla and tiaré flower in it makes it heavenly!It absorbs well and doesn't make my skin too oily! It gaves it a natural glow! I live in the Sunshine state of Florida and i don't have to worry about about my skin being too greasy. I add a drop of it in my daily moisturizer. I also use it after i shampoo and dry my dreadlocks and it moisturizes my locks nicely.The reason i give it 4 stars is because the bottle opening is very poor quality it pour out too much of oil all at once and if ur not careful it spills all over the place! I usually keep the bottle in my bag and because of that i put it into a plastic zip lock bag for protection and i dont know how, it still runs out and the bottle is closed! It's a greasy mess! The first set of bottles came with a plastic safety top on the inside but my last order came with none! The company really needs to consider a more secure bottle top for it! Apart from that i trully recommend this product! I’ve been using this product since finding it in a drugstore while visiting Hawaii years ago. I see a lot of review saying there is mold or something black in the product and I think what people are seeing is the actual botanical used in making the oil. So if it’s plumeria you bought you will have actual plumeria bud/flowers in the oil. Buy it you’re gonna love it! 🌸 💕 The scent is lovely. If you love the scent of coconuts, you’ll love this. Love the product but it's way less expensive in French Polynesia. I have been buying this stuff for years. I love it. I love the way it smells and feels. The only thing I don't like is that it is solid at room temperature.Then I bought this. It is liquid. It does not solidify. It is like vegetable oil, not coconut oil. And that wonderful smell? Not really there... I am going to let it ""steep"" and see if it changes but I wonder if I got a bad batch or a cheap imitation or?UPDATE!!!!I want to change my review from 2 stars to 5. This stuff had to mellow. After a few weeks, it now has that wonderful aroma that I remember from past bottles and now it is solidifying like it is supposed to.  I am now thrilled with it and use it every night.So if you get what you think is a ""bad bottle"" just let it steep a few weeks and.... bliss."
414,B000MASTMO,"I can’t find this anymore in stores.. I’ve always loved the very very light scent of pumpkin in this cream and this cream is very rich. The product is very good, user friendly. I cannot say I have excessively dry skin, but after thorough cleaning my face is definitely in need of some moisturizer. Before giving MyChelle's Renew Cream a try, I was an avid fan of I've been using this face cream for years after a sudden allergy developed to a L'Oréal face cream product that left my cheeks burning and bright red for 3 days straight - even water was torture! I've strayed over the years and always come back to this. I always have it on hand. I have never had any problems with it in regards to skin reactions or otherwise - it really is for sensitive skin! I've used this when I lived in the humid midwest and now I live by it in CO, a very dry climate, it's performance for moisture is stellar. I've never had issue with layering it with other products or makeup either, and it isn't greasy (I have combo skin) but keeps your face feeling moisturized and soft all day. If you're on the fence about trying this, just go for it! Like others have said, it leaves an almost dewey appearance at first, but give it a few and it'll absorb right in. It does help calm my redness and doesn't seem to affect my pores, I don't break out more from this cream. I would say apply another layer or use more next time if your skin still feels tight or dry after using this - it is a little thinner than typical creams but that shouldn't deter you from trying it. Does not leave face greasy or shiny, in my oily areas this doesn't make it worse. I love this product. I used it in a Mychelle tester and fell in love. The scent smells like a cosmetic rendition of pumpkin pie. I guess they really wanted to emphasize the pumpkin content in it. It works really well on the skin and can be used definitely day or night. I am 20 with combination skin and this works well. You only need to dip your finger in it to cover your whole face effectively - seriously, with this less is more. It really moisturizes well and that means a lot coming from me. I can definitely see this working to prevent any fine lines and wrinkles. This is somewhat mattefying and keeps skin looking supple and healthy. I really love it and surprisingly it holds up when it comes to how long it lasts. I had reservations about spending so much for a small quantity, but I use it morning and night and 6 weeks in I have half a jar left, maybe more. The scent is so light but last all day. You will be able to smell it here and there and when your washing your face off at the end of the day in the shower. It's a gender neutral scent I would say definitely. But as a male, I like my own colognes and products so next time I purchase I will buy the unscented version. I'll admit it: other than the lack of parabens and chemicals, I was attracted to Mychelle's pumpkin products because I love all things pumpkin. From food to candles, I'm a sucker for the gourd. Imagine my pleasant surprise, though, when I came to love this one! I have previously used various moisturizers from Kiss My Face and Burt's Bees. I would compare this to a lighter, almost more whipped version of Burt's carrot creme. They both are fantastic for dry winter skin (I get particularly dry around my nose).Like the Burt's this product does take a little while to absorb, but I found it much less greasy than the Burt's. Mychelle offers this cream in an unscented version, but honestly the scent of the regular is quite mild and pleasant. Not at all like a baked good! The color is a mild light green, and I find one pot lasts a long while.My only complaint would be the packaging, and it's not enough to warrant removing a star. I dropped the glass jar once on my bathroom floor, and needless to say it was toast. It's easy to get the cream out of the jar (easier than in a plastic tube), but just try to avoid being a klutz like me.In the past I bought my Mychelle products from online skincare retailers when they offered a coupon code. Amazon's subscribe & save price has them beat! Richly moisturizing without being greasy, glorious scent. This beats out moisturizers that sell for 3x as much!"
415,B000ZFI2PA,"would love for it to be a little bit thicker and creamier for moisture First off let me explain that I came across this product purely by accident. I wasn't out searching for an all natural soap or anything. I had read a review from a woman that had been using this and a few other products a few months before her wedding day, stated that by using all this products together that her skin had developed this beautiful glow and her every once in a while blemish never happened. But when she slacked on using the products after getting married her skin had become dull and pimples started again.Now let me explain a bit about myself, I'm in my early 30's, I've never had terrible skin (severe acne) but it has never glowed (even during my pregnancies), I get blemishes a few times a month (yes, even still at my age and now I have to worry about premature aging as well. In my search to slow down time on my face, I came across this woman's review. I have been using all the products, with the exception of her lotions (I have a day and night cream that I have been using for yets and I'm happy with) for the last two months. At first my skin got bad, like really bad for about a week but I kept using it. After the week and my skin started to clear up, I was left with the softest, clearest skin I ever had! I'm not sure if it is the dr woods, the rose water witch hazel, the st Ives black head scrub or the combo of it all! But it will be what I use until it no longer works!The soap itself smells so clean and earthy to me but my husband says it smells like medicine :( regardless the smell only lasts for 10 minutes or so. Be careful to avoid getting it in your eyes, it burns!!!! A little goes a long way so my bottle I purchased should last at lest a year!Great product and good value! I am absolutely loving my new skin care regimen (thank you Amazon reviewers!). Upon the suggestions of other reviewers I ordered this black soap along with organic witch hazel (for toner) and organic argan oil (moisturizer.) I had been using Clinique and Melaleuca Clarity for years, but now that I am no longer in my early twenties I figured it was time to move away from salicylic acid treatments and move on to something that would help with acne scars and fine lines. I've been using this black soap for a week and my complexion is sooooo much better! I no longer have any redness (I used to get red blotches to the point that one person even thought I had rosacia.) Now I know it was just the harsh chemicals in the face washes I had been using. I also haven't gotten a single blemish since switching to black soap and my acne scars are fading quickly. This stuff is AMAZING! However, it will burn the S out of your eyes! I just make sure to rinse my face extra well and keep my eyes very tightly shut when lathering the soap in my eye area (to remove mascara because it does a great job at it). I haven't had a problem since the first couple uses. Also, it's worth noting that anything sulfate free will not lather like ""traditional"" soap (sulfates are responsible for the bubbly lather effect you get from most drugstore cleansing products), but keep in mind that the saponified coconut oil ingredient in this black soap is basically coconut oil that has been altered to act like soap (saponification is soap making in the chemistry world.) This is why you get less of a lather, but this does not effect the cleansing abilities of the product. My face is happy! I've always used the giant mass of black soap and with me going off to school again, I wanted something a bit more simple without having to break off pieces in order to wash my body and hair. So, I decided to give the liquid soap a try.  I was a bit skeptical at first because of all the extra ingredients (nothing harmful but extra) but I gave it a try.I washed my hair, face and body with it and I got instant results like I did with my regular block of black soap and honestly, I'm hooked already! I used it four times and I'm already addicted, so just a few days after I made my original purchase, I bought two more bottles!PROS:  Excellent exfoliation, mild herbal smell (to preference), helps even skin tone a bit faster (with daily water intake), little is more (it only takes about a cap full to wash your entire body and the same amount to wash a thick head full of natural kinky coils).CONS:  It'll leave your skin ashy (smooth but ashy, I recommend using shea butter as a lotion), if you use too much of it in your hair, it can strip your hair dramatically of much needed moisture but if that happens, you can easily get that moisture back with a mild leave-in conditioner of your choice.EDIT:  I am 100% natural (4a/ Type O hair, thick density, thready texture, thin to thick strands vs LOIS system) and at the moment I have in yarn braids/genie locs (acrylic).  And since using the product, I've noticed that my hair has thickened dramatically in the braids to the point of where the rapid growth is attempting to loc in my hair.  I've had the braids in for 5 weeks and I'm immediately taking my hair out now.BE CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE YARN BRAIDS OR ANY OTHER KIND OF EXTENSION! Love this liquid soap with a sponge. I feel so clean."
416,B001FB5IN2,"👍 The only thing that keeps my skin soft! This controls the dry flaking and itching on my skin.. Used it for years I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to petrolatum, which is an ingredient in a lot of moistures. This doesn't contain it, nor is it scented, which I also like since also I have perfume allergies. I have crazy sensitive skin prone to dermatitis, hives, itchies of all kinds. It's also very dry. I have to moisturize every inch of myself after a shower--from hairline to tips of toes.Since they seem to be discontinuing my longtime moisturizer by Lubriderm (seriously sensitive), I decided to give Eucerin a shot. It's excellent and I'm adding it to my anti-skin-woes arsenal.This really is rich. A very thick cream. Unless your skin is moist from a bath or shower, prepare to have to do a little muscular rubbing to spread it. However, after your shower or bath, when you've patted dry, but are still moist--this is perfect and smooths on richly but easily. Thick enough that a little goes a long way. Very moisturizing, even for my super dry heels.I like that it has no scent, not just because it's less irritating that way (as many have allergies to scent/perfume), but it allows your own choice of perfume to shine and not be interefered with by a lotion's scent.A winner. Recommended for dry skin sufferers, especially the uber-sensitive.Mir I had a accident in 2009 and almost had my leg removed. I have to have a creme that keeps my legs hydrated or I could have skin break down. When I was in the hospital I saw Eucerin in every room and all the staff seem to use it and I asked if it was really that good. I got thumbs up all the way around. When I went tot he wound clinic for 5 mos they to used Eucerin. I have used it daily since mar 2009 and my skin is in the best shape. (I used to have horrible dry skin) I have left the cap off and picked it up the next aday and after being open to the air for over 24 hours it was still usable and was the same as normal. I would recommend this for anyone but especially for comromised skin. This is, hands down, the best moisturizer I have ever used on my face. I have seborrheic dermatitis so I'm quite finicky when it comes to moisturizers as they either cause flare ups or give me breakouts. I have tried 'em all, even the oil-free ones; none served their purpose until this one. I love the consistency of this product, not too thick (like Cetaphil creme) but not too light (like Kiehl's). It goes on smoothly as you apply it too your face and absorbs really quick. Most of all, it doesn't just sit on top of your face like most moisturizers. It continues to work throughout the day as my face feels so smooth and soft after washing my face at night. I will definitely purchase this product again in the future. Thanks Eucerin for giving us this amazing product!"
417,B000KWDFHI,"Great for inexpensive moisturizer! I was looking forward to using this cream but it was a disappointment. My late grandmother used to give me Vitamin E oil to smoothe my skin and help with blemishes and it always worked back then. So I thought a Vitamin E cream would work well just like the oil, even though I hadn't used Vitamin E oil in years. I read the positive reviews on here about this Vitamin E cream and on other sites, but this cream is not for me. I bought this because I have oily to dry acne prone skin plus eczema, and I wanted a really good moisturizer that would help with the dryness on my face. This cream caused my face to break out in rashes and bumps. This cream is NOT for the face if you have sensitive acne prone skin. It's greasy, so using a product with too much grease or oil will make acne worse in my opinion. I requested a refund. Even though this cream is cheap, I do not recommend it if you are prone to breakouts or prone to allergic reactions like I am.I did use the cream on my elbows, knees, and hands without any bad reactions. I have dry skin on my body too, so it's better for me to stick to oatmeal based daily moisturizers like the Equate fragrance free daily moisturizing lotion from Walmart (love it!). It is VERY hard trying to find skincare products for acne prone sensitive skin. It's even more of a headache because Amazon, along with other stores, do not properly label their products so you will know and understand every single chemical and ingredient used. I'm going back to using my benzoyl peroxide acne kit. I'll just go back to using the oatmeal based daily moisturizer on my face until I can finally find a good face moisturizer that works well. Ah well, life goes on! I use it as a base for making my own face cream. It has apparently been bought by a larger company and is now a watered down version of what it used to be but still works well for my purposes. I originally wanted eye cream because my eye area started to get irritated from my usual eye cream so I ordered the Beauty Drops eye cream and this cream with it since it said it was for sensitive skin as well.  I really like this cream, it leaves my skin soft and supple and I use it under makeup and before bed.  I swear my little dry lines are dissapearing after 1 week and when I wake in the morning my face looks hydrated and well rested like it use to when I was younger (i'm 42).  I have never had such results before and have spent hundreds on facial creams.  I think this will become my permanent cream and for a lot less. This cream is super thick and creamy, a dab spreads quite a bit. This jar will last a very long time because you use so little at a time. It definitely feels soothing spreading it on my face, but my skin feels slightly oily. I'd rather oily than dry, and it does feel good so I'm going to enjoy it for as long as it lasts, but I don't know that I'd buy this exact product again. I didn't give it 5 stars because it has a tad bit of a greasy feel to it...making it take longer to ""dry"" on my face before I can put my makeup on.  I feel this moisturizer protects my face from my foundation sitting in my pores....I have had less breakouts.  I do recommend. Hopefully this product will turn out to be beneficial....can't comment on that yet since I just received it.  However, the big disappointment comes in opening the 2 jars I bought and finding that maybe, if combined, they might equal one. Since both jars were the same inside I don't think this was a conincidence.  It was as if there was a divider put down the center when they were filled and half the jar got the cream and the other half remained empty.  :( I haven't had this cream long enough to see it make any real difference on my skin - but the smell is dreadful. I don't mind that it's not scented, but the chemical scents that come through are awful. I dread putting this on at night! The feeling of the actual cream is nice, but I just can't get past the smell."
418,B000NSH2L4,"Ever since the pandemic started, my hands have been dry to the point of cracking and bleeding. It's off and on. But being a stay-at-home mom w/ two toddlers and two dogs, I wash my hands A LOT. I was coating my hands in aquaphor and putting nitrile gloves over them every night. It was hard to find an alternative that didn't irritate all my little fissures of bloody cracks. I decided to take a chance on this. Starting with the small bottle. It only a few days, it has helped tremendously!! My hands were dry, just about to crack, and now they are just fine! I really can't believe it. Usually once they're that kind of dry, it becomes tough to recover with the cycle of constant hand washing. This stuff is great!HOWEVER, I will say, it smells like the slide grease I use on my trumpet. It's not off-putting to me, but may be to some. I'm alright smelling like I'm in the band room all day. Also, you definitely have to use it with damp, not wet and definitely not dry, hands. I learned this the hard way. A friend recommended this for dry cracked heels. I apply a thin layer of urea cream and allow it to dry and them apply cutemol to seal it in. It is the only thing that I have used that works. I had very deep cracks in my heels but they have closed and healed. Have been using it for several years for dry hands/cuticles and brittle nails.  First recommended to me by my dermatologist who uses it as well.  Takes a few weeks to correct initial condition, but used nightly helps keep hands and nails in good condition. My dermatologist recommended this because my fingernails were splitting at the tips.  She said it is due to excessive hand washing (guilty) and use of hand sanitizer (also guilty) which dries out the nail bed...but in my defense, I am a teacher of small humans.  Dr. said to put it on at bedtime each night and when the nails grow out they should be healthy again.  Night one and my hands were super soft in the morning.  I hope it works as she said on my fingernails.  It is a little thick going on until it soaks in, but I think it will be worth it. Used for dry, winter skin. I developed adult eczema. I had it as a child and it returned. This cream is a bit expensive, but worth every penny. I would suggest to get the 8oz. For some reason it goes a lot further. The 2 oz you have to buy more often. Idky.🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ Best cuticle cream/moisturizer I’ve found. This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  It’s super thick and holds moisture great.  Not greasy like Vaseline.  I use it mostly on my hands.  Absorbs well if you follow the instructions"
419,B000FJU4HK,"I have used it for about a week and it works on rough, scaly uneven skin. It works for kp along with the lotion and consistent use.  Not a lot of treatment out there. Not too abrasive Works amazingly well This is another product that will take several purchases to see major results.  My skin is already soft but I want to get rid of the marks/dots.  It lasted longer than I thought but I don't have any money right now to get another one.  This infuriates me to the max.  Way too expensive.  So tired of wanting to fix things and can't afford to do it.  I have had keratosis pilaris since I was a kid.  I just want to have clear soft pretty skin. Really one of the better things you can do for the skin you're in ... Use it in the shower 2x a week and it leaves my skin super smooth and soft.  Aesthetician friend suggested salt scrubs, got one years ago after a deep tissue massage and been doing it ever since. DERMA is a little on the spendy side but the quality is great and my skin is happy so its worth it. I should preface this by saying that my son (now 12y/o) has had KP for years and it has been a struggle. These flesh colored bumps show up in droves all over his arms, cheeks, upper chest, and neck—with frequent stragglers in random places elsewhere, too. As he has gotten older, he has become more self conscious. We have tried a couple of topicals from the doctor’s office, and numerous over the counter moisturizers and ointments. Sometimes these methods work and then will stop without rhyme or reason, or sometimes they never work at all…Now to this product. It is totally different from anything else we have tried. It is a whole process, but it is helping! First, this is a scrub. The formula is kind of creamy initially but it spreads to a fine scrub as it is applied over the skin. I absolutely recommend in-shower (with the water off, for now) application, as some of the product definitely will fall off. In the shower, it easily washes away—no big deal. My son leaves it on for the time it takes to apply, plus a minute or two, and then turns on the shower to rinse and continues with his normal shower routine. The directions advise using the product once or twice a week. My son started seeing results by the end of the second week. It is imperative to use sun protection while using this product, as the ingredients will make the skin increasingly sensitive to sunburn and damage.This is the only product that has consistently helped with my son’s KP, and we are really pleased with the results. He is a pre-teen boy, so I do find myself having to remind him to use it twice a week, but that’s a small thing.We finally have a product that works! His bumps are mostly gone, and his skin is so much softer! So despite this messy application, and the price—I think this scrub is totally worth it. Afterall, Middle school is hard enough without KP. I love the way this stuff makes my skin feel. It is so exfoliating and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. It does have a bit of a strange smell though. It’s not terrible and doesn’t lingering… just kinda weird."
420,B00005333I,"ProsAdds some moisture to under eye areaLittle to no scentDoes not bother my sensitive and acne prone skinConsNot sure it’s actually doing anything for under eye circles or wrinkles - mine are mild but see no differences.Figure the extra moisture can’t hurt and it was worth a try but probably would not repurchase. I love this eye cream but I can't find it at my local big stores  in quite some time so glad it was here and works just as good as I remember! I have dark circles and fine lines and the takes them away like magic! I've tried all kinds of brands mostly high end expensive creams for dark circles and none work for me. This is a great product no greasyness and lightweight. A great bargain for a amazing product! This eye cream is just  “ok.” It was on deal so i decided to try it. Can’t really see much improvement after several weeks, but then most of the creams i have tried are pretty much the same. I suffer from allergies that make my eyes itchy, and I have the impulse control of a stray dog that walked into a BBQ competition. I can't help but rub, rub, rub my eyes until they are raw. This lotion soothes the dry, itchy feeling with the tiniest little bit. It spreads easily, keeps my eyes from feeling dried out, and seems to help with the dark circles under my eyes as well. I read raving reviews if this eye cream and thought I’d give it a try ($11 is ver reasonable). It feels nice and is moisturizing. I think it helped with puffiness a little, but no impact or change with dark circles. I’ll finish it, but will continue the search for something better. I decided to try this product when the Avon product I normally used for over 10 years, was not available any more. It turned out to be the best decision I could’ve made. No puffiness no bags no new wrinkles.| This will be my new favorite L’Oreal product. I am 68 right now so I hope it will continue to be available for at least another 20 years. My husband actually says look 👀 hun my crows feet are disappearing! I was pleasantly impressed with his reaction to this product. Do recommend. Try it why not? Hasn't made much difference to me but haven't used it long either. Not greasy and not scented which is better for me."
421,B0006GBEYE,"Just what I ordered I bought this product because I was going on vacation and wanted something I could take on the plane without checking a bag. I was cautiously optimistic -- and these towelettes did not disappoint! They were easy to use, the product goes on like a dream (no nasty sunscreen feeling on skin), and -- most importantly -- WORKS. No sunburn!It can't get over how easy it is to stick a couple of these in my bag so I always have them. I get burned very easily after only a few minutes in the sun, so these are a life-saver.The review gets 4 stars only because one wipe only just covers arms, upper chest, and neck -- it would be nice if they were a little bit bigger and/or had more product in each packet. Also, the light cedar scent was a little unexpected, but not unpleasant. It comes with sunscreen in one packet,  joined with another packet containing a dry towelette. Interesting concept, but kinda silly. I guess you are supposed to squeeze the sunscreen onto the towelette. Messy. Sunscreen wipes are a brilliant idea!  I just returned from a 17 day tour/cruise in Italy, Greece and Turkey and used these everyday.  I expected to only keep them in my day pack if I need to apply more sunscreen while out and about and use spray sunscreen before getting dressed.  I soon found out though that these wipes are the least messy way to apply sunscreen.  I could apply sunscreen only where I needed it (my skin) and not on my clothes, the floor or anything (or anyone) else nearby.  I was wearing shorts and sleeveless tops and one wipe was enough for my arms, neck, shoulders and lower leg.  The wipes dry up in a minute or two, so make sure the person who is going to get the places you can't reach is right there.  Another huge plus is that they pack so much easier than heavy bottles, and you don't have to worry about the liquid rules on airlines.  I will rarely, if ever, be using conventional sunscreen again. We bought these for a recent trip to Jamaica where we weren't going to check any bags and didn't want to go over on our liquids.  These wipes worked quite well.  They have to be reapplied several times if you are going to be at the pool or beach all day.  They leave a little bit of a greasy feeling on your hands when you are done but that wipes away easily.  It did take a couple to cover our whole bodies.  We previously got wipes from Amazon by SuperGoop that are made for babies and toddlers but couldn't find them again.  I prefer the SuperGoop ones to these but these work just fine. Used product for years with good results but this came with the lotion separate from the towels instead of being mixed already with towelettes making it more convenient. Although this sunscreen is effective (once you put it on) I thought that I was ordering pre-moistened towelettes (moistened with the sunscreen). When the product arrived, I was so confused to see double the number of towelette packets, attached in pairs. It took awhile to realize that one packet holds the sunscreen lotion and the other packet, the dry towelette ( to use to apply the sunscreen). This is so inconvenient compared to another company's towelettes that are pre-moistened. In addition, because it wasn't completely clear about applying the sunscreen with the dry towelette initially, I took a few pairs of them away for a weekend and inadvertently ripped off the dry towelette when I went to the beach...imagine my dismay when I went to apply sunscreen and only had a dry towelette! My thought is that the pre-moistened with sunscreen towelette from another company is patented, and therefore Coretex SunX couldn't package theirs that way? Whatever the reason, I was disappointed with this item. Dried up paper towels. Product is trash. Do not buy from this company they sell garbage. All of my several orders with them came in dried up unusable.I ordered again to give them the benefit of the doubt and I got the same dried up trash"
422,B000EPA4GQ,"I like that when I use this product my skin doesn’t look oily. Best best best sunblock product for vacation! I usually buy 2-3 of these for carry on when I go to the carribean a and use them over my body!!! It is shea butter therefore smooth on application! Works great just be careful to get in your eyes, glad I bought it. Not too greasy or leave a whit cast. I mind this sunscreen because it applies smooth without leaving a white filmI will continue to use This is a wonderful, lightweight, smooth sunscreen with very little scent.  I use it on my pale little face in bright sun and feel confident I am getting the protection I need! Recommended by my dermatologist. Very good and easy to apply. Works well under the make up Great FOR THE FACE!! I have been using this for years— very successfully. Unlike other Neutrogena sunscreens, it dries quickly and smooth on the face, leaving a non-sticky, non-shiny, moisturizer- or makeup-ready surface. (When I run out and use a slightly different one,  sticky and shiny, I remember all this immediately and quickly reorder.) Incidentally, even at my somewhat advanced age, a specialized photo scan of my face a few years back in an upscale beauty department meant to reveal everyone’s hidden sun damage revealed— virtually none! A woman 25 years younger was furious… Remember to “screen” near your ears, btw. Great product"

424,B001DBC8K0,"I have been using this stuff for years now and it completely got rid of my chronic mrsa and staph infections. I would have given it 5 stars but my regular acne is still around (albeit a bit better overall)  The tub packaging is certainly an improvement over the old pump bottle because I can get every last drop out of it wheras the pump bottle there was no way to get all of it and you couldn't see how much was left inside. The tub also comes with a stirring stick thing so thats pretty cool. Ships quickly.  EDIT: wrote this review a few years ago as ive been using this product for nearly 9 yrs total. I was fighting a losing battle with MRSA for 3 yrs and even the specialists were out of ideas. As soon as I started usinf this cream my MRSA was cured. It never came back. However, it appears that they keep changing the formula and now it doesnt seem to be as good as it used to be. My skin is giving me problems again with major peeling and flaking and I have to use a lot more of the cream to keep that issue at bay. Why would you keep changing the formula of something that was darn near perfect to begin with?? And its not like your order comes with a paper that notifies you of the changed formula. It really should because a change in ingredients could cause someone to have an allergic reaction. If it aint broke dont fix it!!! Thats why the rating used to be nearly 5 out of 5 on Amazon and now its 4 out of 5. Stop changing stuff! I want the original formula back! My mrsa hasn't come back and my skin is usually ok enough for people close to me to see me without makeup and I'm not embarassed but this product definitly used to be better in my opinion. Maybe they changed it because you used to have to stir it up a little if I'm remembering correctly. I dont mind that if the actual product is still doing what it should. Don't change key elements just to make lazy people who dont wanna stir, happy. As soon as I received this cream I immediately took it to the bathroom, thoroughly cleansed my face, and I then put this cream on for the first time.  I would love to thank this seller for shipping this to me so quickly as it wasn't a prime purchase, but nonetheless I received my skin clearing cream in only two days when it literally hadn't been scheduled for delivery until next week!!!  I'm greatly looking forward to potentially seeing some of the positive results which so many others have written about here while using this Manuka Honey & Manuka Oil skin clearing cream.  I realize that product is actually listed as a cream and while it certainly doesn't seem to be as tacky as say an ointment would be it also isn't like any typical cream that I haves previously used either, so at least for me what describes this the best would probably be a salve that after being given a little time eventually absorbs well into the skin.  Regardless I am thoroughly excited about trying this cream especially after having done countless hours of research into the endless maize of topical skin products (without steroids) before I finally decided on this particular skin clearing cream for my mid forties, very problematic (multiple flair ups over the past several years with this past year and half having been the worst ultimately now leaving me with several scars), slightly sensitive, lifelong combination skin with what looks to be cystic acne along my jawline.  Over the past five years (first time getting cysts on my face was 5 1/2 years ago) I have unfortunately seen several dermatologists (in my opinion a complete waste of my time) and yet none of them have ever found what happens to ultimately be causing these cysts to actually form.  All of my dermatologist appointments seem to follow the same basic pattern wait two-three months for an appointment once there the doctor will look at and generally will also touch my skin, but never orders any tests, leaves the room for a few minutes, then he will come back into the room telling me that my Crohn's happens to be causing the cysts on my skin, and to use yet another steroid cream.  However my gastroenterologist strongly disagrees with the dermatologists and unlike the dermatologists he has actually done countless labs and that in his opinion my Crohn's maybe making digestion very difficult for me but it has nothing to do with the cysts that are forming along my jawline.  Anyway I have thoroughly given up on finding a dermatologist in my area who actually wants to help me so I have been researching cysts both online while also reading anything I can get my hands onto about skin care!!!  Finally I will update this review when I begin to hopefully see some positive changes happening to the skin on my face especially along my jawline. I first used this product in 2017 and 2018. It was a very think cream, yet genlte, not clogging pores and great for mature skin. Then I used other creams for 1.5 years. I ordered this one again in 2020. To my surprise, it is a very different looking formulation. It has waaaay more water! It is thin and runny. I need about two-three times as much now to get the same moisturizing effect. But the price did not go down. I will need t buy this again, it is not a good value for the money anymore, unfortunately."
425,B001ET79H8,"I have been using Face Wash by Cetaphil, Daily Facial Cleanser for Combination to Oily Sensitive Skin, 16 Ounce for several months now and it has become my go-to facial cleanser. This product is a game-changer for anyone with sensitive, combination, or oily skin.This facial cleanser is very gentle on my skin and does not leave my face feeling tight or dry after use. It is formulated to clean deep into my pores, removing all dirt and impurities, while also preventing breakouts.The 16-ounce bottle is very convenient and lasts for a long time. I love the pump feature that makes it easy to dispense the right amount of product without wasting any.This face wash is fragrance-free and hypoallergenic, making it perfect for people with sensitive skin. It is also non-comedogenic, meaning it does not clog pores.Overall, I would highly recommend Face Wash by Cetaphil, Daily Facial Cleanser for Combination to Oily Sensitive Skin, 16 Ounce to anyone in need of a reliable facial cleanser. This product is gentle yet effective and has helped me to maintain a healthy, glowing complexion. The only facial cleanser I use now! Cleans without stripping skin of moisture. Gentle and effective. I’ve used Cetaphil for my face for many years now. It’s non-comedogenic. I use this product before applying the Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer. I’ve been using this product since I was in high school, so about 5 years. And it’s the best thing that has happened to me. It cleared my face up very quick. First off: They changed the formula. Last year it was thicker and seemed to clean a little bit better. Now it's thinner, but still does a good job at cleansing. I prefer the old version. The newer version is nice though. I have very sensitive skin. This product is gentle, not over-drying (but not moisturizing either), leaves no residue feeling, and rinses off easily. It washes off my face makeup (I use eye makeup remover so I can't vouch for that). It has little to no scent. I use it twice daily. This is not the product that was pictured. This is for oily/sensitive skin. The product in the picture is normal to oily skin! I can’t even return this. Very frustrating. Do not buy. Amo ese jabón porque es muy noble con mi piel, me mantiene libre de acne y no me deja la piel acartonada, no tiene olor fuerte y cada frasco me dura mucho tiempo, así que su relación de precio y uso es muy buena. As the subject states: don't let the packaging fool you. Yes, this looks like the cheapest (and it is), lowest quality face soap. But I went to my derm because I was having issues with my skin (very extreme dryness). She said that I was actually having an allergic reaction to my face soap (a super fancy one), and she put me on a steroid cream for two days, and then recommended this soap. That was a year ago. Everything has been amazing since then. And my beauty regime costs have plummeted! I definitely can use the extra money right now."
426,B00027DMLK,"After I received these and used the first one, I felt a little foolish paying so much for gluing a piece of craft paper to my face.  My prediction was that I would wake up with it firmly attached to my hair.  Happy to say, I was wrong.  The best way to use these is to hold a tiny bit of the patch in one hand, and wet a finger of the other hand to uniformly moisten the glue.  Shake it off and hold it for a few seconds so the water and be absorbed by the glue.  Then press it to your face, make foolish faces in the mirror, and hold for about 30 seconds.  It will stick all night.  In the morning, your chosen wrinkly place will look better for a few minutes.  After repeated use, you may notice -- as I did -- that the wrinkle is less noticeable than before. First, I loved the packaging. It has a vintage look to it and very simple. Two, I feel like the frownies work well with my skincare routine. I’m not sure how well the frownies would work without excellent skin care products. I use Societe clinical skincare products along with the Frownies and my skin looks amazing for 41 years old. The skincare products are pricey but I feel like it’s necessary once a woman turns about 35. The adhesion works well if you do it properly. I use rose water spray on the adhesive side then rubbing it to activate the glue. I use a jade roller to massage my face before using the frownies. I make sure to allow the frownies to dry on my face while I’m resting and not talking . I always sleep with the frownies. Sometimes it hard to remove but that’s because I just pull them off my face rather than using water/washing my face. I use almost everyday for a month and then gradually do three times a week. I highly recommend Frownies! All the reviews I read complained about the smell.  But I feel like the smell is mild.  I have noticed a reduction in my wrinkles in the morning.  But there are times, I feel like I'm wearing duct tape particularly in the mornings when removing them. El producto realmente trabaja y cumple lo prometido, lo único es que para retirarlo de la piel no es muy fácil y tienes que usarlo continuamente para que permanezcan los resultados. If you follow directions, these will work and they will adhere overnight---no chance they will come off.  They are not uncomfortable to wear, but when you touch them, they are very, very stiff.  I guess that is the point: no movement beneath.  It takes a little time to wet them and hold them in place (45-90 seconds per patch), and then a bit of time to remove.  Neither part is hard, and if after using longer, I see lasting results, I would purchase again.  I remove mine with a wet wash cloth.  I keep getting a wet edge further and further under the patch until it comes off without tugging. Be sure skin is smooth under the patch or they will set a wrinkle in and not relax it! For the most part, I love every thing about my Frownies.  The only thing I do NOT love is they do not adhere & stay very well around the mouth & chin area.  I have some pretty significant lines below & slightly to the sides of my mouth which I call my pillow lines.  I guess I love to smash my face in to my pillows at night.As GREAT as these are for the forehead area.  And they are GREAT.  They just aren't as great in other areas.I have tried a silicone brand but those failed miserably as they slip/slide around the face & come off at night.  The Frownies at least mostly stay on at night even though they partially come off.  I must be a rough sleeper.  LOL!  Anyway, yes I will continue to use these.  It cant hurt & it can only improve.I add pics of my forehead after using Frownies for about 2 weeks.  The pic on the left is the night I first used them.  The pic on the right is roughly 2 weeks of using them & right after removing them after wearing them all night.I have already turned one friend on to Frownies & she has bought a box of everyone of them. I have been using Frownies for over 20 years and have always been pleased with the product and the results.  But when I ordered my last box of Frownies, it is apparent that the product is no longer the same.  The paper is much thinner and the glue is not very effective.  When I place one on my forehead at night, most times, the corners don't stick.  And by morning, a good part of the patch has come loose.  Another reviewer mentioned the same thing and said that the product is now made in China.  But I looked at my box and it does say ""Made in the USA.""  What makes the poor quality even more distressing is that the price is now $23.95 a box.  That is pretty outrageous for a product that no longer works.  I may have to look for an alternative to Frownies in the future. As you can see in my before and after photos,  these things worked VERY well on my smile lines around my mouth. I have been very seriously considering botox and/or fillers to take care of these wrinkles but my god, it's SO expensive! I decided to give these patches a try and I'm glad I did.The ""before"" photo I took in the evening right before applying the patches and going to bed. The ""after"" photo was taken the very next morning immediately after removing the patches and washing my face. The difference is extremely visible!I read quite a few reviews from people saying their patches wouldn't stick and I can almost guarantee you it's because they are using WAY too much water. I literally get the tip of my finger wet and use a single drop of water to spread around the patch. Any more than that and it will be too wet and slippery. I have had zero issues getting mine to stick. And taking them off is easy as well. My only complaint is they smell kind of weird lol"
427,B0000682T7,"UPDATE: I reached to Badger's customer service via email and they were very kind. We were able to work out getting a replacement product because I felt like I got an old product with the scent diminished. I received the replacement today, unfortunately the scent for the replacement is the same as the original one I got. So I think this is the normal scent for the balm. However, I am happy to leave a 4 star review (vs old 2 star) because customer service is fast, friendly, and reasonable. They even reached out to me via Amazon and offered a full refund, I did decline since the replacement was already on the way. Even though the scent is light, it's a great balm that is light and moisturizing. A little goes a long way to keep my skin soft and healthy.~~Even if I’m sniffing the balm directly, I can hardly make out any scent. If you’re looking for something with the strength similar to that of essential oils, look elsewhere. The balm itself can be used as a moisturizer or lip  balm, so it’s not a total loss for me. Just doesn’t serve the purpose it’s advertised to for me. I'm sleeping better than I have in a very long time! I'm prone to having a hard time falling asleep and restless nights full of tossing and turning. I've been using the balm for a week and so far every night I've fallen asleep in a fraction of the time and sleep like a rock. I'm really impressed with the product as a whole. It's organic, made from thoughtfully sourced global components and the scent is divine. This used to work wonders for relaxing and helping my husband sleep. Now the scent is barely detectable and “ineligible for return”I do NOT recommend purchasing.UPDATE: I changed my rating because the company reached out to offer me a full refund. My sleep is much deeper. Like the product, very slow in receiving the product from manufacturer.Update:  we having been using the sleep balm for over a month for calming, sleeping and in helping keeping nose air ways open.  The relaxing fragrance Is very subtle and nice. I personally use a Q-tip to scrape out some of the balm and then rub it in the places they say too, but I also apply it around my nostrils and under my nose. maybe my allergies are too in the way for me to appreciate the smell of this product but I swear I poured it on all over, even rubbing it into my hands like a hand cream then got under the covers and NOPE..barely could smell it.  And then my hands felt kind of sticky too.  Tried one more time in the morning to rub it on my cuticles and all around my nose but I don't know, just seems I shouldn't have to work that hard to smell it!  I do think Badger is a great company and I do love all their tins and am willing to try other things, but this just didn't give me the intense smell I guess I thought I would get.  But, that is me,,,,maybe someone else would disagree!!!! Not much effect, lavender scent is very subtle. The smell isn't overpowering"
428,B000KQ1E5Y,"My eye Doctor recommended me this organic soap to clean my eyelids as a part of my eye dry treatment and maintenance. It works very good and keeps my eyelashes and edges of my aye lids free of unwanted bugs ( mites). I have been using it for about 1.5 years. This is a great product.  It takes very little and it goes a long way.  It rubs very nicely and smoothly.  It is also easy to rinse off. Stonecrop is a well-made product, no matter which product you are using cleanser, moisturizer, exfoliate her etc. but just like any company. Somethings need a little tweaking, but this one does not Only takes a small amount It just feels so amazing on my skin!!! I like how my skin feels clean and refreshed after using, never irritated. The first time I was introduced to this product was during a facial. I absolutely loved the fragrance and the fact that it is all natural. It takes very little to get a nice foamy cleanser when washing my face. It doesn't dry out my skin and it doesn't cause redness since I am very sensitive to many products. The only reason I ranked in the middle was because the bottle was very small, of course I just looked at the picture and didn't read the ounces. I thought I was getting a good deal with the price but I was very disappointed when it came in. This product is great for me, I use other products from this company as well. I’ve been using this for years and love it.The results are good, leaves my skin feeling clean"
429,B000JVCBFC,"It dries fast and it’s super moisturizing; it does it’s job! But it has a strong scent rhat didn’t agree with my nausea My wife only used it once so far, but I give 5 starts for smelling exactly like Froot Loops! I won't eat it, but it smells delicious! I just delivered a month ago and even though I'm sleep deprived with little time to do anything other than taking care of baby, I feel obligated to write this review as this really worked for me.  My skin is stretch mark prone even though I have always been of average weight, and I have a lot of old stretch marks on my hips and behind my knees from my growth spurt during adolescence.  So I was really concerned about pregnancy related stretch marks (I put on 30 pounds during my pregnancy) and I'm so pleased to report that this product really worked for me, but I wanted to tell you specifically how I used it.I was really dedicated to moisturizing my belly with this product twice a day from like month 3 of my pregnancy, before I even started getting bigger.  I will admit that the smell was a little strong for me with my super pregnancy sense of smell at that time, so I actually mixed the lotion for a couple of months with a little lavender essential oil that I could tolerate the smell of a little better.  I also added some drops of pure vitamin E oil, and some coconut oil, aloe vera juice and glycerin that I had on hand to the product to reduce the smell but mostly to make it even more moisturizing for my growing belly.  I think that the addition of these natural moisturizing items probably helped too but I'm not sure and I do think that the product is very moisturizing on its own and is not greasy at all.Ultimately though I think that the key to preventing stretch marks for me was consistency in moisturizing my belly twice a day (morning/midday and then at bed time) diligently from very early on in my pregnancy and to the day I delivered.  I believe that you can stay stretch mark free even with a giant belly with consistent moisturizing using a really good lotion like this. I liked this oil--it made my stretching skin less irritated, didn't smell half-bad, and was fairly affordable. I've gone through bottles of this. I do not think it's 5 star worthy, and deducted another star from reading the description of the product claiming to ""prevent stretch marks"". I caution anyone to be wary of anything that says it ""prevents"" stretch marks, as it's not a verifiable claim and there are many factors that play into your skin's elasticity (genes, smoking, alcohol use, weight gain, hydration).  I'm a medical physician who cares for obstetric patients, and am admittedly just as prone to vanity as any other mother out there.  It's difficult watching your body change in ways you had no idea it could. My mother carried four children, including a twin pregnancy, without so much as a single stretch mark,though she was 29 with the last (twin) pregnancy.  I thought I'd be safe, as genetics appear to play a role on stretch marks and I have a great family history.  Since week 7, I've been religiously applying this stuff twice daily.  I'm over the age of 30, and my skin isn't what it used to be, I realize this.  I'm also a non-smoker, rare alcohol use prior to pregnancy, and have gained less than 30 lbs of weight at 38+ weeks pregnancy.  Given my BMI prior to pregnancy, this is right on track.  Around week 24, I noticed some red markings on my sides, which are now very purple and very long stretch marks--my left side worse than my right.  Since week 35, I noticed the purple stretch marks on the underside of my stomach.  Then, there were only a few, but now at 39 weeks, they have become quite numerous and span the entire underside of my abdomen and are creeping upward. At first, I found this extremely upsetting (I'll redirect you back to the above).  Then I found it upsetting that I was upset about it--I know what pregnancy does to a woman's body, so I should not have been surprised! Nor should I have been so silly to think I could ""prevent"" something that is going to happen on it's own!  Can I say that my stretch marks would have been worse had I not used this? No. Could they have been exactly the same as they are now?  Yes, but we'll never know.  And if you feel that anything prevents stretch marks, please direct me to the study/evidence so I can decide if it's a legitimate claim.I would recommend this simply for my vegan or vegetarian patients who prefer cruelty-free, and am a fan of ""less is more"" in my beauty products when I use them.  I would also recommend this for its moisturizing qualities, though it can stain your clothes/bedding.  I would NOT recommend this--or anything else (take that, Dr. Oz)--as a ""prevention"" for stretch marks (again, see above). Instead, I would say that stretch marks happen and we should accept that. There are women out there who would kill for stretch marks just to have carried a child.  I think there's too much pressure on women (in our culture, especially) to not have a blemish after delivery and return to a stick-thin figure. It's not a realistic expectation for ANY woman, and even I feel those same pressures.  I've realized that not matter how many stretch marks I get, or how much my body changes, I'll be damned if this keeps me from a bikini ever again. And when I have baby #2 or #3, I'll be ready for them.  I'm growing a person in me, and I'm proud of that. I have used this on my incredibly itchy big belly since week 30.  I did not get one stretch mark until the 37th week when my baby's head dropped and the skin around under my belly button was under extreme tension.  I felt that area of my skin could tear as my baby's head put so much pressure there.I use this every night liberally after I shower, right before I go to bed.  I suppose this is good for those instances on skin where there isn't extreme, sudden stretching as under my belly when my baby dropped.  Everywhere else on my belly is clean as a whistle.  Even my nurse commented how wonderful my belly looks.  I will continue applying it (especially to the area under belly with lots of stretch marks) once a day at night after my shower before sleeping.Else, this is a very mild, faint, pleasant smelling natural oil that gets a good portion absorbed into the skin.  I wouldn't put it on right before going out in public, as I think the oil would get on clothes and collect dirt.  But have great results just using it before bed and letting it slowly absorb while I fall asleep.  The ingredients seem pleasant.  Like these nice all natural ingredients get absorbed through your skin into your body...which can only benefit my baby.I also had an oil splatter burn on my arm a few weeks ago... after a week since I got burned  after the burned areas developed into scabs, I started rubbing this oil liberally on the burned areas.  It had an almost immediate effect of rapidly diminishing the pinkish skin and helping it to blend with my old skin.  I continue to put it on the burned areas, for the past 2 to 3 weeks with such fantastic results.  Some of the burned spots just are almost invisible now.  (...better than that $150 Strickvia or whatever you call it for removing scars!!)p.s. I'll let you know in a month or two if my under belly stretch marks dissappear after giving birth.  Fingers crossed!"
430,B000EBIDJ0,"The first time I ordered this I was just hoping it would help my hands a little. I have dermatitis on my hands, and on my bad days my hands have small cuts. On my good days there are no cuts but a layer of dark dry scaly skin remains. It's like an ugly protective barrier my body makes to protect my hands. It's been like this for years. When this item arrived I decided to use it once a day before bedtime because it would stay on the longest due to no hand washing while I sleep and that way I was getting my money's worth because this hand lotion is pricey to me. So the first night before bed I put it on my hands and there was a LOT of tingly burning for a few minutes. I dealt with it because again this stuff is not cheap and it is normal for glycolic acid to feel this way if you're not use to it.  After the burning subsided my hands did look moisturized so I went to bed. The next morning I excitedly ran to the bathroom to look at my hands and when I saw them my first thought was, ""Oh... Well I knew it was a long shot."" There wasn't much change. This being the first time I realized I needed to really lower my expectations. Then the second night before bed I used it again and again it burned but again I just dealt with it until the burning subsided a few minutes later. The next morning I didn't bother to look at my hands. I dragged myself out of bed to have my first of the morning pee and when I sat down I happened to just glance at my hands. Then I did a double take. My next thought was, ""OH MY GOD! I must still have sleep in my eyes!"" I got off the toilet, washed and dried my hands (and my eyes) and looked again. My hands almost looked like they did before I ever had dermatitis. It had been years since my hands looked this good. My natural hand color is a yellowy tan. But with my scaly hands they became dark brown. But I was now looking at yellowy tan skin again. And it was SOFT and almost completely scale free! Not hard and dry! I couldnt' believe that in just 2 uses before bedtime it had almost completely erased what I had for YEARS! And I've tried many made-for-hands products. I ran to the other room to show my husband and I shoved my hands in his face and was yelling, ""LOOK! LOOK!"" and ""FEEL THEM! THEY'RE SO SOFT!"" He couldn't believe it either. So, the third night I used it again and the third day it looked even better. It never got better than it looked the third day. That was the peak and the plateau but with constant use it remains the way it looked the third day. I have told such a long story because the dramatic change from night 2 to day 3 was incredible! I continue to use this product regularly. I use to have extrememly soft hands and though my hands are not quite pre-dermatitis quality it's the closest I've ever come with any product. This product won't work for everyone, but I hope my review helps, and I hope anyone who has dermatitis on the hands tries it because it helped me so much, and it is definitely worth giving it a shot. Thanks. I originally was only going to purchase the Aqua Glycolic face care products (toner, face wash and face cream).  However after reading numerous reviews of the entire Aqua Glycolic line, I added in the body lotion at the last minute.  (Only because Amazon was offering a discount if you purchased over a certain threshhold of AG products.)WOW!  This lotion is awesome!  The first time that I  applied it I thought to myself ""This doesn't seem like much.""  It's thin in consistency and didn't seem like it was going to be very moisturizing.  In fact after massaging it in to my hands, arms and legs I felt as if I had applied nothing at all.  I figured that this was going to be added to the collection of other skin care products that I never finished (but find very difficult to throw away....)Later that day I noticed that my hands felt smooth and soft.  (Even after being washed several times already.)  I still wasn't convinced and chalked it up to a fluke or that maybe one of the hand soaps that I has used during the day was the reason.That evening I noticed that my arms and legs felt very soft and smooth too.  I knew that wasn't due to hand soap that I had used during the day.  I thought ""What the heck, I'll try it agin this evening before bed.""  Then I used it again after my morning shower.  The results have been astounding!  I am a forty something woman that had abused my skin with the sun for far too many years.  After my third week of using this lotion, I have noticed that my cuticles are so much better.  My arms and legs feel softer than I can ever remember and my feet feel like I just had a pedicure.  This lotion is a miracle.Due to my heavily sun damaged and dry skin I've always had to use heavier, thicker lotions to ""feel mositurized"".  I now realize that the ""moisture"" that I felt was not my skin itself but the layer of product on my skin.  After I would wash my hands or shower, my skin would still be as dry and flaky as before.  With the AG Body Lotion I can apply it in the morning after my shower and feel smooth and moisturized all day.(Without a greasy feeling too!)My only complaint is that I wish that they sold this product in a larger bottle and offered it in a purse size tube.Although I am happy with the other AG products that I purchased, it is the body lotion that I absolutely can't live without. I kind of bought this product on a whim.  I was not happy, recently, when my son lifted up my hand and said, ""Wow! Grammy's hand!""I loved my late mother but her hands were not her best feature.  I have always put lotion on my hands but figured there wasn't much more I could do.  Then I tried this lotion and it's already making a difference..Without a doubt, the dry spot on my elbow, which developed there due to my arthritis, has almost healed.  This is almost a miracle because I have tried everything I could think of on that.  Occasionally it becomes a scab and it's not how it looks but the fact that I fear it might become a skin ulcer that has troubled me. It's practically healed.  Even my husband, the original doubting Thomas, had to admit it was very effective, and started to use it on the dry skin on his legs.The lovely sun spots on my hands are fading, I swear.  Maybe it's my imagination, but I don't think so. With regular use, I hope that the only thing that makes my son look at me and think of my mother is the fact that I'm always talking!The cream has a very light scent that fades.  It isn't greasy but if you have an animal, you'd want to use it the last thing at night, after you've petted him, because the Glyco Acid leaves a very bitter taste on your hands.  I don't think my cats would be happy if I petted them right after using it, since they always lick the area I've touched.  Best to wait about a half hour before touching them.Otherwise, give it a try because I think it's an extraordinary product and worth every cent you pay for it!"
431,B001ECQ4IU,"I favor this over all. Nice and creamy. I use for body and face. Love this, especially the lack of scent! Works well. Ok, so I was looking for a moisturizer a little thicker, on the lines of Eucerin or something, and this ain't it.*Very* thin. Sure, it goes on smooth, but let's face it GUYS, sometimes that's not quite what you're looking for.Also, they have some kind of new packaging that has this weird, t-shaped pump that you twist before you can use it, which would be ok by me, except for the fact that the nozzle is the shortest I've ever seen. I'm not sure why they went with this design because there is no advantage at all to it. Just weird.At least they got the lack of scent correct. The lotion is fine just the pump on the bottle is very fragile I had to put it into squeeze bottles. Really great for dry skin, keeps moisture absorbed.  Good consistency,  not sticky or super thick.  Recommend.  I have allergies to certain fragrance/chemicals in beauty products and this lotion doesn't have any chemicals that I am allergic to which is a definite plus. Will buy and use again, OFTEN. Love this lotion. It absorbs fast & leaves my skin soft. Definitely helps keep my eczema at bay. However look elsewhere (another listing or Walmart) for a deal.According to the price per fl oz at the top of the page and the ""what's in the box"" sections, I should have received 3 bottles. The seller clarified that this is just a 1-pack though, which makes both of those other pieces of info incorrect."

Isn't that why people buy this particular product in the first place? Great price. Smells great! Joop! cologne sold on Amazon is an amazing bargain.  The price for this large size is unbeatable.  It's usually over twice the price at any department store, maybe more!If you like the smell of Joop! and plan on buying it, it is FOOLISH to get it anywhere else.  Amazon sells it for FAR less and will ship it for free.  It got here in just a few days with the free shipping option.It's a high quality cologne made in France, not some cheap stuff made here in America or elsewhere.  Previous colognes I've bought didn't seem to last all day.  My wife would have to put her nose right on my skin or clothing to smell it.  Not with Joop!, it seems rather potent and lasts all day long.  A little bit is all it takes, which is a good thing!  This very large 4.2 ounce bottle will last quite awhile!  Don't bathe in the stuff, just one squirt maybe two and you will be good for the day.It's cheap enough you can get it as a gift and feel like you gave them something really special.You can't go wrong with this amazing smelling cologne with a smell that lasts all day. I like it. You have Everything!Great deal.Amazon is the BEST EVER This perfume was ordered for my wife because all the women around had used it up that were using our bathroom. Me agradó la durabilidad y la fragancia. Great product"
433,B0018HH444,"so, I used to use this product a lot in high school, but then I stopped straightening my hair so I honestly forgot about it. I’ve been getting my hair done recently, and this is a product that has changed the game for me. I live in Texas so it’s super humid here, and that’s why I can never manage to keep my hair straightened longer than a few days.. but I recently rediscovered this product, and I am so grateful that I did! This product is amazing, leaves your hair feeling so silky, so smooth…I used to think I wasn’t able to straighten my hair anymore because of how bad it looked once straightened, but after a nice trim and just a little bit of this product, my hair looks amazing! This product spreads out so much, a quarter size is more than enough!!! (Remember it has to be activated w heat so doing it beware if doing after you straighten.. better do to before blowdrying or straightening!)If you’re like me and constantly feel the need to touch up but are scared of heat, then I’d recommend putting a super tiny bit in and then blow drying it w a brush. That’ll reduce any frizz and give it that truly silky finish. A little goes a long way!!  I have silver, wavy hair.  This makes my hair shine.  If I use it gently, my curls stay put.  A friend recommended it because I love her hair.  She has blonde straight hair and it is so shiny an soft. Love this, my salons sells it but it’s cheaper on here! Smells really nice but not overpowering and doesn’t look greasy. A little goes a long way! I’ve been using this for years! Not only does it protect your hair, but it gives it a nice shine. This one was a great price, so I purchased it on Amazon. I’ve used this for years. Works amazing. Much cheaper on Amazon. Saw a lot of reviews saying it was fake. But mine is real. Same smell and texture and product I’ve always gotten at the salon. Love the scent, it does what it is supposed to when applied to my hair, it moisturizes and cuts the drying time in half and it leaves my hair feeling soft but strong and manageable. It also makes my hair smell wonderful. I have used Chi Infra Silk infusion for years.  I started using it when I was swimming a lot and the chlorine damaged my hair.  It's a great product. The silk infuser is an oil that you work into your hair.  I love this stuff! A little goes a long way. Greatfor dry hair and ends."
434,B0006O4MCM,"I love the smell...it seems to dry my face out though.  I have normal skin with reddish tones.  Love the fact there are peptides in this, but wish the ingredient content would be labeled on the bottle.  Also, shipping was very, very slow.  It took almost a month to get and then, they shipped it in a bubble wrapped small package, so the plastic cover was smashed off and the product was leaking.  I'm glad the glass bottle didn't break.All in all, I'm not impressed.  There are other products out there that are better.4/3/12  UPDATE:  I recently received an email from this vendor asking me to re-evaluate this product.  I was really happy to see a vendor that actually cares about their customer's experience!  I have continued to use this product and do notice my skin is firmer and brighter.  After continued use, followed by a moisturizer, it continues to be the toner I reach for first.  As for the shipping -- I am impressed that the vendor is sending me free samples for my trouble.  Not many companies actually read AND FOLLOW UP on reviews of their items.  I will continue to purchase this item from this vendor.  I changed my rating due to the vendor's concern and the fact I really do continue to use the product! Overall, I really like Suki products and have purchased this toner twice for myself and gave it as a gift to my mom (who likes it too).  Given this, I think it is quite clear I'm a fan!  Typically, I spray this on after I wash my face.  I also find myself spraying myself for a refresher through the day, as sometimes my skin gets oily or I just need to wake up.In terms of packaging, I like the glass bottle and have saved the last few I've gone through and filled them with other sprays.  In fact, I do have one filled with witch hazel toner, which I use to calm minor skin irritations elsewhere on my body (I have sensitive skin).  Its formula does not irritate my skin either.It's scent is on the strong side.  Although its scent does not bother me, I could see others who are sensitive to scents might not liking this.  My only personal vice with is its price.  I know, Suki uses high quality ingredients, which does justify the price to an extent, but I'm on the hunt to find a toner that can deliver Suki level results for less money. I may never find that, so I will continue with this toner. It works! I've used it for a few days, about 3xday. I spray it on cotton to wipe my face focusing on the trouble rosacea red & pimple areas and I also spritz it on my face afterwards and it quickly drys up. After moving from Southern Cali to the PNW my treatment for rosacea was no longer effective. I tried many different things and had some good results but nothing complete and lasting like with the toner. I noticed an almost immediate improvement the same day. Now it has been 3 days and wow! My face is clear and smooth and even toned. I have actually tried several of its ingredients individually and separately, again with just-ok results. Seems this combination of ingredients is what my skin needed: Vit C, lavender, chamomile, rose, calendula, aloe... And regarding the scent: I like it very much. It appeals to my earthy soul. Thank you! I will be ordering the other items in this line! My cheeks are starting to get more sensitive and I wanted a product to calm that down. I've only been using this a couple months..not sure it is helping, but I think it may be starting to...will give it more time. It definitely has not dried me up or broken me out at all, love the light fresh scent...I use it throughout the day just for a quick pick me up! Still have at least half the bottle left which is impressive to me considering how much I use it! I'm still using Suki as Trial facial. I have awful skin since I was about 9 yrs old. I have cystic acne (usually only when I eat refined sugars), blackheads, scars you name it. I started using Suki products and used this tony for about 2 months now. I find that it helps only a bit when cleaning. It is best used with a cotton ball or swab to clean the pores. Spraying doesn't seem to do much except maybe help re-balance moisture after cleansing. I'm not sure I'll keep this part of my cleansing routine, its still under scrutiny. I love the toner, but hate the new spray bottle! It doesn't spray that good to properly cover your face. It's so much more of an effort. I ended up pouring the new product in my old bottle, so much better. The packaging looks nice, but isn't cutting it....back to the cutting board! I also wanted to add that the toner has a wonderful fresh citrus scent. It's hydrating, but not oily and has done wonders for my acne/cystic prone skin! I love this toner! It's great because of the attached spritzer. Most toners use feel harsh and also have to be applied with a cotton pad, but not this one!It sprays evenly last a long time, it's all natural and does a really great job of evening your skin tone to give you a fresh look and feel. Great for freshening up to after work . I use the Suki Cleanser so I figured I would try out the toner. I really do not how to assess the product because it doesn't really do anything. It smells nice and feels a nice refreshed feeling on the face, temporarily. I did not see any change on my skin and any affect on my face. I gave it 3 stars because if feels nice during application and, again, for the scent, and being gentle."
435,B000052YN7,"My dermatologist recommended this lotion and I love it.  It is non greasy and it absorbs into my skin very quickly.  I often add a little lotion to my foundation.  This has practically no scent to it, not even chemical scents.  Because it spreads so easily, you just need  a small amount of lotion on your face.  About the size of a pea should cover your whole face.  Excellent product! Both my husband and I love this product. It’s so lightweight and dries quickly once you put it on your face and body.  It will be our go-to moisturizer from now on! This product is more easily absorbed by my skin than all the expensive products used in the past. It is light does not leave a heavy or greasy/oily feeling and lasts all day. It does not interfere with my makeup by looking caky or oily and is odorless. It’s works great. I’ve used this lotion for many years. It is professionally gentle for extremely sensitive skin, scent free, moisturizes very well, soaks in quickly, and leaves no residue. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. However it is not cheap and its price continues to increase over time. Recommended by my dermatologist, great basic moisturizer. My husband has eczema and this lotion seems to help him. We have purchased many times. I buy DML because it does not clog pores and it does not have a strong perfume smell. it is better for my allergies than some lotions."
436,B000V70MWS,"I wrote this for the 0.74oz size ""lip balm"" container and loved it so much I just bought the bigger 2oz size:I have been having reactions to various products on my lips and have been trying to figure out what the culprit is. So I was looking for a product that has a single or very few ingredients. First I was just using plain white petrolatum, but even though it wasn't making my lips worse, it wasn't making them better either. After some research I found lanolin, especially the purified medical-grade kind. Most of it seems to come in lotion type tubes or big tubs, but this one is a perfect little pot that I can keep in my purse, so I got it. Wow, what an improvement! My inflamed lips felt so much better after applying this product. They have stopped peeling too. It lasts a long time on my lips (isn't easily eaten or licked off) and is very moisturizing and protective. I specifically did not want a product with fragrance/flavor (in case that is what caused my lip reaction), and this has none. Some people's reviews say it smells ""sheepy"", but I think it smells more like a new bandaid (antiseptic). After you've had it on a few minutes, that goes away, but I don't really find it offensive anyway, since I consider it a medicinal product. Also, some people say the consistency is too hard or makes their lips white. I feel that is because it is a natural product with no stabilizers and the consistency will vary with temperature. I live in a hot humid climate, so that hasn't been a problem for me. It isn't too hard or too soft and goes on clear. I have been using qtips to apply to keep from contaminating the pot or getting hands sticky. You could easily use a finger to apply if you wanted to though. I will definitely buy this again. I have had a tube of Medela Lanolin for YEARS.  Maybe fifteen years.  And it finally ran out.  I don't use lip balm, I just smear a little rosehip oil and then some lanolin on my lips every time I brush my teeth, and everything stays good for the rest of the day.  So you can see, where having used the Medela, it worked so well I was cautious about using something else.  And there was a review about how sticky it was, how it made your lips numb.  But.  I took the leap, which, looking back, not sure what I was so worried about.  $10? Exactly.  But something made me try this.  And I couldn't be happier.  It came in a very nice, easy to use tub.  It IS plastic, and I would have preferred glass, but.  I can always transfer it if I want.  Anyways.  It smells GLORIOUS.  Not a strong scent, but can definitely smell that it is lanolin, which is also reassuring to me that it hasn't been TOO processed.  Its a beautiful warm honey color.  And a teeeeeeny bit goes a longgggggg way.  It slides on so easily, no tackiness, no numbness, and it lasts all day.  AND it's distriibuted through a company right here in NC, which I love to support.  Thank you for a great product!  I'm kind of sad I won't need another one for a while ! I discovered lanolin as a nursing mother when I was given a tube of Lansinoh.  I continued buying it as it is absolute magic on chapped lips/face/hands/feet - for me and my children.  Lansinoh brand is expensive, though, for this and very inconvenient when trying to squeeze from the tube (especially when in the winter).  I was looking for an alternative. A pure, anhydrous, pharmaceutical grade product. Initially, I tried Medela - not only was the tube still an issue, but the product seemed to have something added to it as it had more the texture of petroleum jelly and was not as effective as Lansinoh.  I then tried a product from a company called NOW - it was very inexpensive and came in a large tub.  Reviews for it were mixed primarily because of the smell.  I couldn't help but give it a try and - those reviewers were right - the smell was atrocious - a foul, fuel-like odor.  Works like a charm, but the smell puts me off and drives my husband crazy (who usually isn't that sensitive to smells).  I'll continue to use it on my feet only (overnight with socks - truly magical) but cannot get it any closer to my face than that.  I also will not purchase it again. With the hunt back on, I found this product, reasonably priced, in a convenient tub.  I just opened it and - heaven! - it is just like Lansinoh!  No foul odor, very sticky (softens as it warms - so you only need a very small dab).  This is going to be my new go-to for all things chapped!  I highly recommend using it on hands and feet, then covering with cotton gloves and socks over night.  As I am approaching my late 40's, I have found my hands and, especially, my feet are getting really dried out (yuck!) - the lanolin helps in a way no other product I've used has (and I have tried A LOT of different products!)."
437,B0011EO7WQ,"Okay, I am really in love with this stuff now, lol. I normally use a gel mask several times a week. It's been a Korean collagen gel for a long time. Still, this time I wanted to try something different because I already get collagen daily through micro-needling, sonic massage, and supplementation. Enzymes are in my cleanser, but nothing else, so I thought this might be something nice to try.I love it. It's kind of hard to explain, though. It is mildly acidic, but not as irritating to my skin as retinol, salicylic acid, or benzoyl peroxide can be. I can go over the 5-minute specification without much if any skin irritation. It's VERY nourishing and hydrating, which I wanted it to be so... YAY to that! But unlike other gel masks, this one does something a little different: it helps break up dirt and sebum in your pores, so when it gets rinsed off... perfect 10 skin. It even has helped minimize my pores a bit. But the major reason to use it isn't that it helps keep pores clean or nourishes the skin. The major reason to use it: it makes your skin glow up like a lightbulb! More even skin tone, and definitely - visibly - brighter after just one treatment.It smells like papaya but I wouldn't recommend eating it, lol. Kind of sticky feeling like glue with glucose mixed into it or something... first time I used a gel that was sticky and not just slippery. A little goes a long way. It can be a bit difficult to spread with a silicone applicator in comparison to other masks because of this... it's thick and takes some work to thin and spread out. I recommend placing it in several places on your face to begin instead of just starting at one spot, then spreading all those out to cover the entire face. Easier that way!You can leave it on as long as you want... probably overnight even, though I haven't tried that yet. I have sensitive skin though that has a lot of bad reactions to skincare products, and I've been able to keep it on for 15m so far. I haven't tried any longer than that - don't need it, actually, lol.I do highly recommend using a mud mask prior to using this mask if you want to avoid any chance of breakouts. This mask is very rich, and not only will you want your skin to soak up as much of it as possible, but also adding this on top of clogged pores might make them worse. This is not a one-shot or even a primary solution to clogged pores. It just helps break anything down that was too hard and stuck to get out of your pores before you used it. Follow up with a facial oil to keep it from becoming hard again, and you will be in the clear within a week of daily treatment.Highly recommended to any woman over 35 just for how well it brightens the complexion even when you're tired. And also recommended to anyone that wants to use an acidic product like retinol, salicylic acid, etc. but has sensitive skin preventing it. I do like the Alba Botanical Jasmine and Vitamin E Hawaiian moisturizer. I have also used and like their  hair shampoo and rinse but I really did not care for this product or feel it did anything for my skin.  I use to go for facials before I retired and he had a papaya product he used that made my skin look luminous and very fresh. I am searching for a similar product since he is no longer in business and I had hoped this might be a good replacement. So i was in the market for a masque ( i suffer from acne and i do have a lot of acne scars) when I came up upon this. After reading the ingredients and several reviews I decided to make the purchase. I liked the ingredients and I try to use effective yet gentle products on my skin and this sounded perfect. With this product a little goes a long way, so while the package may not be huge it will last you a while, it is easy to apply, does not run or drip and has no strong scents. I have notices my face feeling a tad warm when i apply the product but it is nothing uncomfortable or strong so I don't mind. To remove the product from my face i simply rinse with water and another thing i like is that even though it's thick it isn't difficult to remove and isn't difficult to rinse. I've noticed my skin feeling much healthier after use and I have a nice glow going on whenever I use this product.This is the first product I've used from the brand and I am impressed, i'm actually considering purchasing a few more items from them and trying them out. Needed a new face mask, and I wanted something with a little ""extra"" - not just a clean face. I saw this makes your pores appear smaller, and it gives you a smooth and radiant finish. I've had other Alba products before, and I really liked them. I noticed this item has no  parabens, phthalates, or synthetic fragrances and I was immediately down for buying this. The item arrived quickly without any damages. It comes in a box, and inside the box is the container. The container was sealed properly, so I felt safe using the product. You received a decent size amount of products. When you open the product there is a clear cap that goes over the opening - I like this as well because it helps keep bacteria out. The product itself is clear, there is no color or smell (at least I couldnt smell anything) to it. It is very goopy, not sticky - goopy, and kind of cold. It recommends applying a thin layer to your clean face and leave on for 5 minutes. I applied a thing layer to my face, and was waiting to feel that ""tingle"" all the other reviewers were talking about. No tingle for me. Boo! It was like a regular mask, except no smell, no color, doesnt harden, and it actually is kinda difficult to get off. Not in the sense that it sticks to your face, but since its clear, you really cant see it too well if you actually do apply a thin layer. I ended up washing ""extra"" off my face this morning. I have not seen results yet, because I fell asleep right after my mask, but so far I like it because of its qualities. I'll keep testing this one out."
438,B000R961M0,"I have always used Dove hypoallergenic scent free soap, ever since a dermatologist recommended it to me as a teen. So I'm not into heavily scented soaps, but I decided to give this one a try. And I have to say the scent is just right, not too strong. I'm surprised someone would use the term pungent to describe the scent. It gives me a very fresh, clean feeling, with no lingering scents once I'm rinsed off. If I smell my skin afterwards, it just smells clean and natural. And it lathers up real nice. I keep my head cropped pretty short, and it lathers so good that I use this on my stubble as a shampoo. Pretty much the only thing I use in the shower.  Makes a great lather for shaving as well, haven't bought shaving cream in years. Only downside is, you'll go through these bars real fast as they tend to dissolve quickly. Lets get right to it.Pros-------------------------Value - I picked up 14 bars for $8.92 cents.  That make its $0.67/per bar.  I got it on sale, thus for me, the cost value -was good.-Scent - The scent was pleasant, it wasn't BAD, but wasn't really anything amazing.Cons----------------------The Bar It Self - The actual soap bar, is quite weak, I found that it broke very easily.-Longevity -  The bar burns through its size quite fast.  Literally, I had 7 bars ( the other 7 were given to my parents) and they lasted me a little less than 3 months.  We'll say 80 days to be liberal.  80 days / 7 = 11.42 days (again 80 is liberal).  I think the fact that the bar would constantly break and little pieces would fall off contributed to this.Notes:  I have skin that doesn't dry out or get to oily.  I bought this soap strictly because it was on sale.  So I can't comment on whether or not it works in moisturizing and what not.  To my skin, soaps seem to all do the same thing.Final Thoughts - PASS, unless that is, you get a smoking hot deal comparable or even better to mine.  There are better cost effective products out there. I usually don't write reviews but I felt a need to share my experience with using Dove soap. I've used Zest and Dial all my life and never had a problem with it. As the years went by, my skin started to become very dry. I, like most men, thought, ""Dove? Oh it must be for women. I'm too manly to use Dove."" I was wrong. This is the best soap ever. My skin got better in just two days of using this soap. For less than a $1 per bar (using subscribe & save), this is a bargain! No complaints about the soap, but keep in mind 14 is a LOT of bars of soap! I live on my own and probably use up a bar every few months, so this is going to last years. Thankfully, it appears that this soap doesn't noticeably degrade over time. I use this everyday. Scent is not overpowering. My skin does tend to get a little dry in the winter and sometimes I have to add a moisturizing body wash to my routine as I feel this dove soap can dry my skin out a little (either that or not moisturize it enough). Nice smelling soap. I have sensitive skin and I've tried lots of brands / types and always return to Dove. loving by these in Bulk! Much prefer to the smaller sizes. Product came undamaged This is soap. It’s good soap. It’s the soap our family buys every time. Smells great and my sensitive skin family can tolerate it."
439,B001ECQ4R6,"Good for any skin type. my mother, my mother in law,my sisters used this cream.Old fashion, but still the best.Good quality.Reasonable price. Best moisturizer for the winter and great deal! My mom used it, and as I do now. My face loves it. Quick service, great old style product I am looking for. Have ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT Been using this For years works good on my Skin Only lotion that provides full coverage and gets rid of dry skin.  I can’t use cheaper products after using this.  Great for sensitive ski as well I've been using this cream for many years....  Mainly as a body lotion because my skin doesn't tolerate most other moisturizers -- they tend to block the pores and/or don't get absorbed.  This moisturizer works very well -- it's light, not greasy, has a pleasant light fragrance...  Great for my picky skin =)  Never had a reaction or breakout from it, as I have with many other brands. Not being in a pump bottle is great for the wallet, too, you get to use every ounce of the cream without having to deal with turning a bottle this way or that way or cutting it open, even, to get every bit of what you paid for out ;) Worth it"
440,B001DJ15KG,"I give it three stars due to the poor delivery and execution of the seller. I ordered from this particular seller and received an open bottle. The seller taped the box and the plastic wrap, but not the nozzle of the bottle to prevent loose cap. The cap was very loose. The seller didn't even bother tightening the nozzle. Pathetic. Now I only got 6oz of the stuff instead of 8oz. I'm very disappointed.Lately I don't know what is happening with Amazon and places like it (it is happening everywhere, in fact)... but service and courtesy towards customers has gone down dramatically. Seriously! It's like these people don't care for their work or something. If you can't do it well, don't do it at all. Let those who truly care have the job. These sellers even have the audacity to argue with the buyer over things that the buyer have clear evidence, beyond substantial (actual photos and such). I could go on, but lets get with how great this product is.I am in love with Dr.Bronner's products. I heard great things about them, especially their fair trade and the no animal testing part, and it is made in the USA. Wow! Dr. Bronner's has it all. A soap, if get the water mixture correct, can be used for anything from body wash to hair wash to washing laundry and more. A washing conditioner (haven't tried it yet but will). Lotions of all sorts. I just love the fact this company follows the same values as I do. I think testing on animals for cosmetics is irrational. Treatment of employees should be mindful and respect, with dignity and fair pay. The product made in the USA that has ingredients I can read and know (I could make it at home). On top of all that and more, this company serves the country by giving 40% of its revenue to charities, schools or other public facilities to improve them. Putting money back into the people who use and support their brand. How awesome is that!?The products aren't just good for animals, people, environment and the wallet (a little goes a long way and a gallon bottle of their soap lasts for 6 months or so). I tried their soap and it's awesome. Got rid of my problem skin fast and no more issues on my hands, due to harsh chemicals from other cleaning brands. That soap is multipurpose and a small amount is all one needs. This lotion is no exception. A single pump, about a quarter size amount, is enough to cover my whole 4ft 10inch body, and a small tiny pump, nickel size amount, is enough to use on my hair, especially at the ends. That is right, you can use it on your hair too. I figured since this stuff is basically made of the same stuff as Bronner's Hair Lotion, I told myself after a shower, ""Why not the hair?"" A tiny amount is all I need. Granted my hair is at shoulder length for some hair strands and just slightly at the collarbone for other strands, I do have tons of hair strands (in a small ponytail I have an inch thickness). I have bleached out silver blonde hair, which I retouch the roots once month to every two months. This product doesn't discolor the hair nor make it dull as other lotions do. I think it's the oils within the product that add shine to the hair strands. My hair feels like hair after using this. I had used other products from big name hair companies and my hair either gets very dry, fuzzy, oily, dull looking or my hair color alters dramatically. My hair would feel worse after using those big top name brands at drug stores and such. I don't get those nasty side effects after using Bronner's All-One lotion for the body. After two weeks my hair feels thicker and healthier, even at the ends. WHAT!? Even so-called colorists are shocked at how healthy even my ends are. It is beneficial for these people to convince people to come to their place and fix the damage by chopping your hair off and recoloring it, so you can spend over $100 for their ""kind"" serve. Between my own tiny half an inch trim - you say 1/2 an inch to a salon lady and you'll get a huge 4 inch chop, plus a style that really doesn't go with your face at all - anyways, between giving myself a tiny trim and Dr. Bronner's lotion, my hair feels like unbleached out hair, new. Please keep in mind I did used a tiny amount of Wild Growth Hair Oil (white and green bottle) in my hair before applying this over. I'm so glad to have found this and using it. My skin seems to like it too. No more ashy, scaly elbows and knees. My skin looks and feels better than when I was 15 years old. Amazing.Again, the result for the low score was the horrible delivery service. Granted, a little goes a long way, but still I paid for 8oz of the stuff not 6oz. If the seller did a better job, I give this the full five stars. I bought this lotion after doing much research. I wanted a better and healthier alternative to the additive laden most products seem to be. Smells nice and seems to work well. Does not irritate my skin and seems to be helping with the dryness. Only reason I left off one star was the weak packaging. It came is a plastic bag with the lid half unscrewed. There was lotion leaking out around the lid. Also, no safety seal. So I am just hoping this is legit and glad only a little lotion leaked out. In this day and age, I would like to have seen a safety seal and some kind of package instead of a plastic bag. I thought the Lime smell would be passive, but I've got to tell you it's a strong smell. I do like this product but I must say that if your hands are chapped or cracked the peppermint stings! Feels very smooth and nice when it goes on but by the next morning my hands were dry again so I guess not long lasting… don’t think I’ll buy it again and I’ll stick with NOWS Cocoa butter or Vit e hand cream. I'm confused on this product. It goes on beautifully. Smells good too but, for some reason my hands feel dry after putting in on. I haven’t had a chance to try the lotion yet, but I know I won’t be repurchasing because of the way I received the lotion. I read some reviews and understand I’m not the first customer who received it half way open with the lotion leaked and spread all over the wrapping nylon. It’s sloppy and unacceptable, I don’t know how much lotion leaked from the bottle but it’s a waste of MY money. I’m not happy Patchouli seems to have a lovely it or hate it reaction with most people. The lime changes it just enough that everyone tells me how good I smell. I love this product as well at Dr Bronner's hair cream is also wonderful.  You just feel healthy using the stuff even if you aren't.  Now I love patchouli and you can smell it with this one (though there is also a Lavendar one as well) so be warned just in case you are not a fan or are around people who will complain!  It is kind of thin and watery but not in a bad way...more in a oil kind of way.  I love it and will continue to buy it again along with the hair cream and his bar soaps....highly recommend...."
441,B00121TESA,"Felt bad when I ordered this because it was just a small gift to go with my wife’s bigger anniversary gift. She had mentioned wanting some cetaphil after using some her sister had and I wanted to get her some. Times were tight so this small bottle was all I could really do at the time. Figured she would only get a few uses out of it, like you would a travel size bottle. I was WRONG. She still has this and she uses it often. (I bought it for her in Feb 2020, it’s now almost December 2020) Great price for this little bottle. Sensitive skin.  Lots of money spent with Dermatologists.  One of them suggested Cetaphil decades ago and it's the only cleanser I've used since then.  Wouldn't risk trying anything else. I was looking for a great product for my face and let me tell you this one will do it. It works for my oily face and it leaves it very smooth after wards I use it everyday. I heard many YouTube influencers rave about how good this is but I never tried it. I got burns from a terrible exfoliator that I recently got as free gift. I used cetaphil cleanser to clean it of my face and it soothed it automatically. I've never used something so gentle. I need this by the case. So if anyone is mega shmega super sensitive like me, you can't go wrong with this cleanser. Not paid, sponsored nor prompted review, actually bought it with my own coins For my whole life, people have been talking about how great Cetaphil is. I finally tried it out for the first time, because my older skin is becoming more sensitive and dry. I don't know if I will repurchase this. This particular Cetaphil just doesn't do a good job of cleansing my skin. I have been having to wash my face twice with this, in order to get it clean. What a waste of time and product. I wear sunscreen and minimal makeup and my cleansers are usually able to get it all off in one wash (minus eye makeup, but I use something different for that). Not Cetaphil. It's a little whimpy in the cleansing, for the price. However, it is great for dry skin like mine, because it doesn't irritate it or dry it out. My face did feel nice and smooth after, but I have moisturizer to do that. What I needed was a good cleanser. I'll pass next time. It's enough to even want to wash my face once at night, let alone twice. This is a well known ""go-to"" product that I've heard about for many years but did not use until was recommended to me by a dermatologist after I had a laser peel. I was told it was one of the most non-irritating cleansers that you could get. I used it for my ""recovery"" and was very pleased. I still use it now although I alternate it with a couple of others- one oil cleanser for hydration and one for exfoliating. Cetaphil is great as a gentle cleanser but if you have dry skin, or ""more mature""  skin, then supplementing it with others is a good mix- for me anyway. Soothing product for a good cleanse! I would not recommend this for people with bad acne, because this cleanser is geared more for people with very sensitive  or dry skin who just need a good squeaky clean wash <3 It will not dry out your skin and the formula is a gel-like cleanser with teeny tiny microbeads that work to clean your face of any dirt or oil, but still leave it moisturized afterwards :) Like many of the reviewers here, I have sensitive combination skin. I typically struggle with redness, small flakiness around my nose, and tightness after I wash my face.This product is gentle on my face and does everything that I need it to do. I still notice it to be slightly drying, but that's an easy fix - I typically pair this with a moisturizing night cream and my skin ends up happy :)I would recommend this to anyone."
442,B00021KD2C,"Very concentrated and soooo moisturizing.  I have very dry skin and this keeps me soft and hydrated.  I use it on my face, arms, legs etc.  A little goes a long way. I have mild rosacea. Most creams that don't irritate my skin dry me out. With this stuff, my skin feels soft & hydrated. I prefer to use natural, cruelty-free products, so this is a win. This is a very good cream for your face. Non irritating, smoothing and I have sensitive skin. Great for sensitive skin, leaves skin soft and easy to use under makeup Inexpensive and very saturated love it as a body creme! This stuff is great!  Doesn't help my fine lines but it's a great moisturizer and was vegan which is what I was looking for! Love that it also has retinol.  I'm on my second jar and will continue to use this product. It's not bad but its not impressive. It's a bit thin, and it does not absorb well into the skin on my face. It just sort ofsits on top This is by far my favorite moisturizer from Derma-e. I actually like the majority of their products, but some of the formulas have changed and prices have increased. This particular product has not changed and has only slightly increased in price. It is a creamy, smooth formula that spreads evenly and simply feels good on my skin (it even does well under makeup). I have a tendency to break out very easily (even in my 50s), but my skin responds very well to this moisturizer despite its thick consistency. Plus, it does not have a strong fragrance which so many products now have.If you have not tried any Derma-e products, I recommend almost all of them. I have been using their products for many years and very few people know that I am 52; most people think I am in my thirties still. So…yeah, I definitely recommend their products. 😅"
443,B00005NAOJ,"It's bitterly cold and dry this winter - no news, I know - and I was noticing that after showers I was feeling even more itchy and dry than usual.  I use Cetaphil liquid soap to wash my face, Cetaphil lotion for moisturizing face and body - so I thought I'd give the bar soap a try in the shower before I dried up and vanished from the face of the earth before Spring.  I bought it, I used it, have used it for a week now, and it's made a big difference in how comfortable my skin feels.  I'm very happy I finally tried the bar soap, and I have no plans of switching back to my previous soap (Ivory) in bath, shower, or next to the sink for handwashing.  Great brand, Cetaphil, and I've no qualms at all at recommending it to anyone and everyone.  Also:  this Cetaphil bar soap, fragrance wise, is either fragrance free or if it does have added fragrance, I can't discern anything and I'm super sensitive to fragrances, so if you prefer no fragrance in your soap for whatever reason, you can rest assured that this soap won't bother you in that regard, either. So far, so good. We trust our healthcare providers The soap is my favorite moisturizing soap. I have sensitive and dry skin. I’ve use this for many many years and wouldn’t use anything else. Nice soap but not effective on my skin. SIEMPRE CUMPLIDOS I have tried so may different soaps for my trouble skin. Eczema is a horrible problem. Because of this soap and the moisturizing cream, I have had less flare ups and my skin is softer and not as dry. Since I have only been using it for a week I am looking forward to seeing the results in a month! The soap is good for sensitive skin. I would recommend this product!! Good. Smells like a hospital. But good nonetheless"
444,B000O3UCTC,"I really like this. It gives me the protection I need and helps me to lighten my scars because of the sun protection. People complain about the initial white cast but so long as you don’t put on too much and you allow it a minute or two to absorb, you’re good to go! I just got back from a week in Cancun. It’s all day in the sun and water.. a great combination to burn!  But I never did. My skin stayed clear and never dried out  I am now wearing it daily under my makeup.  I’m completely hooked I have not use it yet but so far I like what I see. I tested it on a small area and it felt very soft, easy to spread, and I like the smell. Siempre batallo con mi piel xqe es muy sensible pero esto es lo mejor que e tenido lo recomendaria siempre me compuso mi cara practicamente porq hasta unos granitos qe tenia se me quitaron This is the best face sunscreen I have ever used.I work outside on boats and on the water. My face is constantly getting burned. I have been using regular sunscreen, and it's just aweful!!!! The spray on stuff doesn't work very well, it's greasy and burns my skin. It messes up my makeup, when I sweat it runs into my eyes and burns my eyes, it makes it's way into my mouth and tastes terrible all day and at the end of the day I am a shiney greasy mess....who still has a sunburn.The lotion isn't any better, it opens and clogs my pores and just seriously makes my skin and face look terrible on top of all the other problems I have with the spray on sunscreen. I feel like I could never apply enough sunscreen and I dreaded it every time.I was searching for face sunscreen because surely there has to be a better option, when I came across this.It said it was dry to the touch and matte as well as long lasting.I was skeptical but needed something different so I gave it a try.At first it feels like regular sunscreen but it dries and gets non greasy really fast. Like within seconds it goes from regular sunscreen to this amazing finish that actually makes my skin look a little better than it did.Each one of my boat tours is around 2 hours each. I reapply between each tour and I haven't gotten burnt since. I have had no problems with sunscreen sweating or getting splashed into my eyes which is super important because I am the lead boat and if I cannot see traffic in the harbor I am putting all of the other boats in danger.It doesn't get in my mouth since it's not super runny and messy.I get home from work and I don't look like my face is melting off.Seriously I cannot tell you how valuable this product is to me. It has solved so many problems in my daily life and I am so grateful that they thought to come up with this. Finally a sunscreen with no white cast! Although I am very very pale i haven't noticed a cast. Doesnt feel gross under makeup either ! I live in Santa Fe, where the sun shines 300 days a year, and at 7000', it is vital.  I bought this after looking at many sunscreens and like how easy it is to put on; there is no white haze on my face, it dries quickly, and my makeup sits nicely on top of it.  I like the max coverage of 70 SPF and Neutrogena's brand.  I will reorder this when I run out, which will be quite a while, as a little goes a long way. I bought this for my husband. His son burns easily. He feel comfortable with it. No reaction. And it did the trick. He did get a little sunburn but I think it's just because we were out in the sun all day. I would definitely buy this again."
445,B000BX1Z00,"so, I used to use this product a lot in high school, but then I stopped straightening my hair so I honestly forgot about it. I’ve been getting my hair done recently, and this is a product that has changed the game for me. I live in Texas so it’s super humid here, and that’s why I can never manage to keep my hair straightened longer than a few days.. but I recently rediscovered this product, and I am so grateful that I did! This product is amazing, leaves your hair feeling so silky, so smooth…I used to think I wasn’t able to straighten my hair anymore because of how bad it looked once straightened, but after a nice trim and just a little bit of this product, my hair looks amazing! This product spreads out so much, a quarter size is more than enough!!! (Remember it has to be activated w heat so doing it beware if doing after you straighten.. better do to before blowdrying or straightening!)If you’re like me and constantly feel the need to touch up but are scared of heat, then I’d recommend putting a super tiny bit in and then blow drying it w a brush. That’ll reduce any frizz and give it that truly silky finish. A little goes a long way!!  I have silver, wavy hair.  This makes my hair shine.  If I use it gently, my curls stay put.  A friend recommended it because I love her hair.  She has blonde straight hair and it is so shiny an soft. Love this, my salons sells it but it’s cheaper on here! Smells really nice but not overpowering and doesn’t look greasy. A little goes a long way! I’ve been using this for years! Not only does it protect your hair, but it gives it a nice shine. This one was a great price, so I purchased it on Amazon. I’ve used this for years. Works amazing. Much cheaper on Amazon. Saw a lot of reviews saying it was fake. But mine is real. Same smell and texture and product I’ve always gotten at the salon. Love the scent, it does what it is supposed to when applied to my hair, it moisturizes and cuts the drying time in half and it leaves my hair feeling soft but strong and manageable. It also makes my hair smell wonderful. I have used Chi Infra Silk infusion for years.  I started using it when I was swimming a lot and the chlorine damaged my hair.  It's a great product. The silk infuser is an oil that you work into your hair.  I love this stuff! A little goes a long way. Greatfor dry hair and ends."
446,B001E96N48,"Pure and gentle, it removes excess oil from your face, rinses clear and its hypoallergenic formula contains no harsh detergents, dyes or hardeners. No pore-clogging residue left behind. Helped a lot with my acne in the past, still using it after years. I began using Neutrogena as a freshman in college.  My roommate loaned me her bar and I was hooked.  It was wonderful for my sensitive, very oily skin.  No more shiny, greasy nose by noontime; pimples; or blackheads.  I use it in my ears as well. I’m 75 and still a believer in this fantastic soap.  I have rosacea and Neutrogena doesn’t aggravate my skin.  I won’t use any other brand above my neck-shampoo, moisturizer, makeup.  The liquid form for your face has the same qualities. Great product for oily skin. It keeps your pours open Use as bath soap not just face. Love it. Great gentle facial soap. The description says it is a pack of 8 what was received was a pack of 6 . Not returning it because i am presently out.  Lasts as long as a regular bar of soap, pleasant smell, easy on my face and neck."
447,B0016BBHC2,"Great value. Good scent and my skin appears brighter when I use daily. I have used this cleanser for years. The latest bottle seemed like the liquid had been diluted. Very watery. Had to use 2-3 times as much cleanser. Probably won’t but again. I have been using the A.H.A. 3% Facial Cleanser for several years now and decided I would try this for a change.  It was no surprise that this cleanser was just as good.  It removes oil, dirt and makeup with ease and leaves my skin so clean, without feeling dry and cracked.I’m happy that I have another choice when it comes to my favorite brand of facial cleansers. I discovered this product on a website that lists face wash that’s highly rated and gets a low ewg rating. This is the second bottle I’ve purchased and I like that it lasts a long time. Most non-toxic or “healthy” face wash is over $10 and lasts a few months.I also like that this face wash is a soap free formula and has a lite refreshing non-synthetic fragrance.I have a mix of dry, oily, sensitive, acne prone skin with large pores. The formula doesn’t aggravate my skin. I do moisturize in the AM.Shipping was fast, but I was disappointed that the pump nozzle wasn’t in lock position and it leaked inside the package. I like this better than their cream.  The smell is subtle, but clean.  It doesn't leave my face try or oily.  I like the consistency of it.  A few reasons I didn't give it 5 stars.  First of all, nothing about it screams 5 stars to me.  I feel like I have to use a bit more of it than I do other face cleansers in order to clean my face.  And I didn't experience some king of transformation in my skin.  It loos like it always looks.  This includes a brief time of just using body wash on my face.  So could definitely be better.  But for the price, the pleasant smell, the evenness in oils, and the fact that it's cruelty free, I'm happy with it and have stopped looking for new products to clean my face. Looking for a ""cruelty free"" face wash and found the BWC brand. Used the lotion cleanser initially, but it really didn't work for me. It was fine but I prefer a cleanser that foams up a bit. Tried this Vitamin C w/ COQ10 product and really like it. Nice clean scent and washes off nicely. Some other vitamin C cleansers that I have used seem to burn my eyes if I don't rinse it off well, but I haven't had that issue with the BWC product. Highly recommended if looking for a nice fresh and mild face cleanser. When i 1st used it, it burned a lil bit.. But i kept using it and it works very well. I have noticed my dark spots start to lighten up and skin appear brighter. I also have the serum to go with this. Will buy again Love this face wash! The smell is just amazing and helps me wake up a bit every morning, which is when I typically use it. Does not leave my skin greasy or with any residue. I am very acne prone and have very sensitive skin and this does not aggravate my skin at all. Although you're not supposed to use it around your eyes, some times I'll use it when removing makeup from the rest of my face and have had no irritation (great makeup remover btw)."
448,B000052YQN,"I have not used Ponds in many many years but i started a better cleansing routine now that im nearing 70..I did not realize I was getting such a small jar..plus it's not the Ponds I remember and this is my own fault..its the makeup remover type..I just wanted a regular facial cleanser..on the good note, my face is extremely soft and moisturized again..this stuff is greasy but in a good way and it DID remove my makeup well..I am going to keep using and probably order the one I thought I was getting..shipping fast, accurate This product has been around a long time. This is my go to facial cleanser and pre-moisurizer. It does the job in keeping my skin clean, and soft. I use it each morning and at night. It doesn't need much rinsing because it could even be wiped off once applied. The excess can be a moisturizer, so no need to over rinse. This is a classic product for makeup removal and I've been using it to remove drag makeup for some time.  It's easy to do on the go and I appreciate that you can remove most of your makeup without a mirror or a sink.  Drawbacks for me... It isn't great at breaking down eyelash glue and it leaves my skin feeling heavy/greasy.  Overall, I love this product, but I usually use it in combination with others. This is the best facial cleanser I have  ever used at a reasonable price. This product is moisturing yet doesn't stain my pillow cases.  It removes eye makeup easily and moisturizes the eye area so I don't need to buy eye cream for lines around the eyes, like crows feet. GREAT I’ve been using this forever it’s my favorite 😻 I had been using zero cleansing balm which I really love.,.  But it’s a little pricey for the small jar.  I wanted to try this to see if it’s similar.  My first thought was that it smelled like oil…. Not cosmetic oil or cooking oil.  It smelled like car oil.,,  that was weird.But I used it anyway and it does make my skin soft.  It doesn’t remove mascara though.  My mascara is not waterproof..,  I use princess lash in in the green tube and this can’t remove it no matter how much I use.  And it leaves a bit of an oily film on your skin so if you don’t like that you’ll have to use a second cleanser to remove that.  I sort of like that oil feeling, especially at night time.  So…. I had bought 3 jars and will use them but I’ll probably switch back to a cleansing balm soon and just use this once in awhile or maybe in the shower."
449,B001392TJM,"So... the item has a “new look” according to the box but also a new formulation, which is not mentioned.Firstly, it contains PEANUT oil, so please, if you are allergic to peanuts don’t use this!!The ingredients listed online do NOT match the ingredients on the tube. They moved some ingredients around, mostly down the list meaning less of it within the product. The “age radiance” complex is listed towards the end of the ingredients and is a mix of many many good ingredients BUT it is almost the last ingredient so the amounts of it are low. Enough to be effective? Who knows? Having said all that, I think, the ingredients aren’t that bad and I will use it.The actual product....It is a generous 4oz tube. It is a light pink colored, creme gel consistency. It does have fragrance, not overpowering (thank goodness) but present and is a light sweet, fruit scent that I don’t smell after I apply it.I would say this is a light moisturizer despite being called a cream. If you have combo/oily skin you should be fine, if you are dry this wouldn’t be enough moisturize. I have added a few drops of my own “beauty oil” to it before applying and it ups the moisture a bit. If you have acne prone skin I would not use this as the oils used in it are not acne friendly. They’re are also no “moisture spheres” as mentioned in the description. The product is a very smooth gel creme as I mentioned before. So, again, a bit deceptive in its marketing.Overall it’s a 2.5/5I will use it up but will not repurchase unless the results are just amazingIf you are looking for a lightweight moisturizer with some decent ingredients then give this a try. It’s 4oz for 10$. Not a bad deal 🙏🏻 Rich, luxurious moisturizing cream. LOVE IT!! I love this stuff! I usually find this for sale at Marshall's or TJ Maxx for $4.99. If they have more than one on the shelf, I will buy all of them. But when the stores are out, I will pay a little more to get it from here. I have been using the 40 Carrots serum for several months and it's been doing an excellent job. I needed a new moisturizer and since I love the serum wanted to try this. I was not disappointed. This stuff is so great! I have oily/combo skin, moreso oily in the tzone area. This is probably a little more moisture than I actually need but I really love it. Makes my skin super soft and smooth. With my skin type it does take a few extra minutes to soak in before i can do my makeup. I'm guessing my skin will get more accustomed to it after several months of use and should be even better. The smell is so amazing also, it's fresh and clean, perfect. The value is incredible, no way you can get 4oz of product of this quality at this price, I'm blown away. I do my homework on facial products and this was no exception. I have tried them all, high end and drug store, this is the best by far. I have been using this product for a few years.  I don't find the smell overpowering & it does work well enough for my dry skin.  The price point for this product is a huge plus. I put it on while my face is still damp.  During the winter months, I use extra moisturizing over this product. If you're someone with very dry skin, you may want to try this in the summer months.For the reviewers that have found to to be too drying. This may be due to the retinal in this productand having a sensitivity to that.I believe this product would be more of a stand alone product for those with combination skin. I am happy with itas a daily moisturizer for under my make-up. But, I still use a heavier moisturizer at night. ( why 4 stars instead of 5 for my skin type. ) I had used 40 Carrots before and loved the way it made my face feel but I had not seen it in a store for several years.  So glad I found it on Amazon.  I definitely will reorder it again. I only use a tiny bit for my face and ears but it works without leaving you greasy. Great smell. I get these spots in my eyebrow and around one of my gauges that my old Dr said was exczema and gave me an ointment for. It worked, but only when applied multiple times per day. This I don't even apply every day. Just after I shower only and it was kept these spots at bay!Update for the Mamas out there, this works GREAT on diaper rash! Like seriously amazing. My son just got a bad diaper rash from his overnight diapers the past few days and I put a small dab on each time he's been changed today on both inner legs and it's almost completely gone! Very impressed. Very disagreeable scent, returned."
450,B000Q8R6W6,"I like the way it makes my skin feel but I don’t like the smell I bought this because of the lack of a lot of chemicals and scent. And have bought it again. It works great, and I feel good using it. I’ve been using this product for years. And I love it! It soaks into your skin without leaving an oily film. Nourishes your skin and feels wonderful. And it is one of the best natural products out there at a reasonable price. I purchased this lotion because I love the scent of mango, and the reviews were mostly good.  Unfortunately, this lotion smells NOTHING like mango!  It has a scent that is not entirely unpleasant, but it is not even a little bit like mango.  And what's worse is that it lingers for hours, until you wash it off.  Even more unfortunate, it is not returnable, so used once and it will go in the trash... LOVE THIS LOTION! I have bought one for all the locations a sit in my house lol. Very nourishing and my nails are growing so fast + my cuticles look great (mainly use this on my hands and elbows)Highly recommended. I add this to my body crème for a vanilla chai scent Omg 😱 have not had to purchase for over a year what a disappointment. I have purchased this product 2 times prior. The scent is the biggest issue not lavender for sure. Yuck !!!!If I could return I would.  Cannot recommend Desert Essence doesn't disappoint. I buy their other body care products but this is the first time I tried their lotions and wow! Smells amazing, light weight and moisturizes wonderfully. Now I want their other scented lotions! Very pleased!"
451,B001E96M58,"Have used this for years. Kitchen sink worked like a miracle already used this soap before - for sensitive skin - is very good Product is great! I didn’t like the phishing e mail trying to get more info from me telling me if I didn’t fill out the info that my. Amazon acct would be discontinued! Working great for my sensitive dry skin. Cleans without drying.  No breakouts. In fact seems to be calming skin redness.  Like how my face feels after washing I have been using (Johnson & Johnson) Purpose Soap for well over 25 years for my face.  It can be used on all body parts, however, I keep it specifically for my face as I wash my face twice a day with it and it rinses clean and does not irritate.  I will continue to purchase it although I do understand it is being made under other than Johnson & Johnson.The package, however, arrived taped and was partially open--although the contents were intact.  The packaging could be improved. Many years ago I suddenly developed rashes on my face, ears, and hands. I went to my husband's dermatologist and he recommended this soap since I had developed a sensitivity to soaps, hair shampoo/conditioners, lotions, sunscreens, and cosmetics (even hypo-allergenic ones). All these products were causing me contact dermatitis. I had had isolated incidents in the past but at that point in time the condition became permanent. The dermatologist said I was a 1 in 10,000 person who is sensitive to hypo-allergenic products. Of all the products he tried on me, this soap and one other product were the only ones I could safely use. The other product was  discontinued by its manufacturer about two years laterI have been using this soap for 23 years. I have never gotten a rash from it despite getting rashes from all kinds of other soaps, skin, and hair products. I carry this soap with me when I travel because the free soap in hotels and soaps at the homes of people I am visiting cause me dermatitis.The manufacture of this soap has stayed consistent since I started using it. It's important that people giving this a try for contact dermatitis problems know this. Unfortunately, I have never found any brand of skin lotion, sunscreen, shampoo, or cosmetics which I could consistently use without getting a rash so I do still have bouts of dermatitis caused by these other products. I KNOW, in each incident, what is causing the dermatitis because it is always when I have just started using a new bottle or bar or other container of a product...and invariably, the list of ingredients have changed or it is labelled ""NEW and IMPROVED""!I applaud J&J for keeping it simple because I know I would be suffering without this soap.As he has aged, my husband has also developed skin rashes (not dermatitis but other types) and this soap is gentle enough to be non-irritating for his rashes too (other soaps cause them to worsen). He too uses and travels with this soap.This soap is hard to find at bricks & mortar grocery stores and drugstores. The ones that carry it often run out (we were near to running out recently and everywhere I went its space on the shelf was empty). It is NEVER on sale and rather expensive compared to the other bar soaps. The price on Amazon.com for a Prime member is better than I have ever seen elsewhere.BTW: Over the years, the list of things that cause me contact dermatitis has expanded to include latex gloves, latex medical equipment, laundry detergents, the adhesive on strip bandages, leather watch bands, plastic watch bands, some types of jewelry, the saps of many plants. The list just keeps growing (sigh). Very good soap for face, non allergic , no dryness. was recommended my Best Dermatologist Dr Manzini. I love him:)"
452,B000KJRK22,"First of all, it’s not brown sludge or mold, it’s a flower. I bought this stuff and saw it all over the islands of Tahiti and that’s exactly what it looked like (yellowish oil with a dark brown flower in it). Why does it turn white and thick? Because coconut oil changes from liquid to solid at ~75 degrees. Put the bottle in warm/hot water, give it 5 minutes, it’ll liquify. I’ve been using this oil for over 2 years for my hair. I live in Phoenix and my hair feels like straw from the dry heat. I put this oil in the bottom half of my hair (not scalp) and let it air dry (which doesn’t take very long in the desert). The smell of this oil (Tiare, which is the national flower of Tahiti) takes me right back to the islands! I loved this product all natural and a great price and nice scent!For all those who say there is something black growing inside the bottle there isn't you need to run the bottle under hot water and take a look like I did, it's just a flower that they use to make the product that's how natural it is they leave pieces of the flowers inside the oil. See my photos.1 photo was taken when it is white and thick and shows the oil before I ran it under hot water and yes it looks like something black is growing inside it but, I took the rest of photos after I ran my bottle under hot water and it revealed that what looked like something black growing inside the bottle was actually a dark purple flower inside the bottle complete with it's green stem. Coconut oil when not warmed to a certian tempature is a little more solid, again this validates how natural the product is, they use all natural coconut oil. For this reason I will definitely buy more and try a different scent as well. Love the smell and works well--but beware and don't be afraid: it will bubble up and harden, live olive oil in the fridge. Put it in a warm place and it will go back to being oil. Weird but fresh, right?! I first tried Tiara Tahiti on my first trip to Tahiti in the late 70’s.  After several trips thereafter I would load up as it was not available in the States.  Not much has changed, still that special smell and soothing coconut oil. Love this scent and the feeling on my skin When I was in my 20's, I travelled to Tahiti.  When I was there, I discovered this perfume/body oil.  It smells wonderfully of Gardenia, and is used by women all over the islands there.  When I found it online, I had to order some!  The downside of this product is that it congeals at lower temperatures, so you may have to run some hot water over it for a few minutes if it is not stored in a place above 60F (I guess that is never an issue in Tahiti!).  Also, it is an oil, and it is not a light cream, so be aware of that fact.  I just love it! I really like this scent a lot. I have the original, vanilla, and ylang ylang and I love them all. But the this and the original tiare get used the most. I really like this scent because it's easy to layer fragrance or I can just wear it alone. I love using this on my hair it's become so much stronger. It even seals my split ends till I can trim them. I have waist length hair and I use this as a pre wash and I use a little when my hairs really wet and run it through the ends. I do not use it on my scalp unless I'm doing a deep treatment. My hair feels and looks so much better.Also coconut oil can penetrate the hair follicles which is excellent as I love the results it gives me. I even use it in my boyfriends hair and it looks so soft, shiny, and a little thicker I think. As a body moisturizer I use it all the time and my skin is beyond normal soft. It's like a whole different world of soft. I don't mind the plastic but would prefer glass as Monoi ages better in glass. I'm thinking of switching my oil to glass bottles. I really recommend this oil. The scent is so yummy and tropical but subtle and a touch of sweet. Perfect, love! Monoï is my latest beauty obsession and new favorite multitasker. I already tried the Sandalwood scent, LOVE it, and wrote a nerdy extensive review on it. So I'll keep this simple: Same awesome monoï, natural, wonderful moisturizer, soaks right in and good for your skin. I use it all over my body, and it doesn't break out my face--even good for sensitive & breakout-prone skin. I've had success using it as a weekly pre-treat deep conditioner for my hair; I don't need to use conditioner after shampoo and it makes my hair extra soft & shiny. My first and absolute favorite is sandalwood. I'm not usually a fan of floral fragrances but I really like the Plumeria variety. It is very delicate and subtle. It is not the kind of overwhelming scent that people smell when you walk into a room, but something noticeable in an intimate situation. It also has great staying power and I can smell it on my linens afterwards.Monoï newbies should know that authentic Monoï is made exclusively in Tahiti and the first ingredients listed must be coconut oil and tiare flowers. Also I shouldn't have to remind anyone that coconut oil solidifies under 68 degrees Fahrenheit and will return to liquid once warmed. (Was it here I saw somebody complaining that theirs ""hardened into disgusting sludge"" because they couldn't read a simple description?) It's really not complicated to use lol. Try it."
453,B000052YLX,"I have been using this to cleanse my face since recommended to me by dermatologist probably 8 yrs ago.It cleans makeup off and is very gentle and non drying. Have been using it now for those 8 years with a follow up of witch hazel with a cotton ball. I’ve used this soap for many years and it works great on my oily skin. It does burn your eyes if you don’t get it all washed out good. It’s a little more expensive than I want but it works so I’ll keep buying it. I have sensitive skin and have been using this cleansing bar for years. Cleans extremely  well without over drying.  Now the price has more than doubled in price!! Price gouging and they get away with it. I've been using purpose cleaning bar for over twenty years. And I believe that my statement says it all. I have used this soap for YEARS and love it! I have a very oily face and struggled with acne growing up. My dermatologist recommended this as a teen, and I've been using it ever since. As an adult, I still get the occasional breakouts so I continue to use it twice a day. This dries out your skin, making it more difficult for acne and oil to build up. If I have an area with some acne starting, I will soap up my face and leave it on while I shampoo my hair or brush my teeth, to really help it seep into my pores.Highly recommend for oily and acne prone skin. Used this for years , love it !👍 I've been using this soap for several months to see how it does for my mild-to-moderate acne prone skin and it's living up to it's praise!I have mixed type skin (dry-to-oily, it's just all over the place!) and I get acne on my forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, and jawline.Since I've started using Purpose, I've seen a big improvement! My skin doesn't get as oily and my acne has died down. What acne I do get, I get around my time of the month - hormone acne, the best kind of acne - so while this soap doesn't prevent that acne, it does cut down on how long the nasty little face demons stick around.My only real complaint is that it does leave my skin rather dry after use - more so than any face soap I've used before - but, no big deal, a little mild moisturizer and I'm good to go. I'm a very happy customer. This is a great ethical and cost effective option for those with sensitive skin! I’ve used purpose’s liquid cleanser since 3rd grade (I am now 26) and in an effort to save money and plastic I tried this facial bar. I cut it in half, and I keep on half in the shower, and I am store the 2nd half to use once the first half is used up. I think this bar might last me a whole year. It is also great because you can carry it on when traveling, since it is not liquid."
454,B0009MHJS0,"I am officially a lover of shea butter thanks to this product. I am usually wary of natural remedies and when people report crazy amazing stories about them, but this stuff really works.I originally bought it for my hair, but I ended up using it for my skin too. For my hair, I mixed it with coconut oil (I think it was 2 tablespoons of shea butter and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil). It did wonders for my hair, which is very dry, 4b, African American natural hair. I use it for my twist outs and it makes my hair very soft and manageable.But, as I said above, I began to use it on my skin as well. I had really dry feet, especially on the bottom of my heels. It was so dry that it was rough and flaky; I could literally peel the dry skin right off. After using shea butter consistently for about 2 months, the skin on my feet have become SO much softer. The skin on the rest of my body has become noticeably softer as well. I love a combination of baby oil when I get right out the shower, a little bit of shea butter, and then topping it all with a small amount of my favorite lotion for the scent.The shea butter sold here is very soft, creamy, and easy to use. Unlike cocoa butter, which (in my experience) has to be melted down before you can do anything with it, you can scoop it out the container and apply it directly to your skin. Even though its not ""off-white"" like a lot of other reviewers complained about, it still works just fine. I've never heard of shea butter being anything but yellow, and when I researched it, most sources say there's no real difference between the two. But it works well for moisturizing either way.The only thing is that shea butter doesn't seem to help with scars and stretchmarks. Stick with the cocoa butter for that, I guess. But if you're looking to add a bit of moisture to your skin or hair, I'd strongly recommend this.The downsides: Shea butter is very greasy and oily when you first put it on. The thing is, its not really a huge deal because it absorbs into your body after a good 5 minutes and leaves it soft and smooth. Another downside I suppose is the smell. Its not a BAD smell, because it just smells kinda like a nut or something, but it can be annoying if you prefer perfumed lotions. That's why I put a little bit of my lotion on top (just a little though). Another downside is the packaging, which can be pretty off-putting for buyers who are used to pretty, flowery, decorative packages. It will come in something that looks like Tupperware. But to be honest, I wouldn't let the package deter you from using this great product. And again, even though the package says that it has healing properties, I haven't really seen that yet. Maybe with more use over the course of months I'll start seeing that.Overall, I think its a superb product. Please don't let the various, random bad reviews stop you from ordering this product if you're really looking for good shea butter. I already ordered another container of this stuff (and its just as good!) I've never used raw shea butter before, but I've been switching all of the products I own to 90%-100% natural after my abrupt case of ezcema.Even the shea butter I've been using from L'Occitane,it moisturizes other parts of my body well... but not my hands (with the problem) as it dries back up, flakes and itches within five minutes. And I've also recently found that it has some chemicals in it as well. And of course it's really expensive...I read the reviews and had some mixed feelings about it regarding the packaging and the quality of the product itself. But only at around 5 bucks with free shipping, I thought I'd take my chances.Packaging: It did not come in a zip lock bag like some people mentioned. It came in like... a plastic take out container. I made sure to order it while it was still pretty cold so as not to have a melted gooey mess. The picture shows a whole brick of the product, but it actually came in maybe...3-5 smaller chunks, not crumbs like for some people.Physical Description: It's a little bit more yellow than the picture. The picture shows a golden chunk of butter but it's actually a bright dandelion color. It looked almost unnatural like some people mentioned.. but I'm guessing that's just the color it has when it's untreated and raw.Product Quality: It's hard but breaks apart into ""cream"" texture pretty easily. I rubbed it on my left hand. It doesn't smell bad at all like some people say. It actually smells kind of like my argan oil but much less nuttier. It wasn't gritty like some said, very smooth, thick and rich. My left hand was left very moist and the butter was absorbed completely without the oily residue within minutes. Even the finger I used to rub it in was very moist! My right hand was very itchy while my left hand was soothed.I'm glad I ordered this product. Amazon said it would take longer to ship but it came quicker than expected. I don't love the container.. it's kind of hard to open.. but I have tons of containers that I can switch to, so it's not a problem.I'm not an expert.. nor do I have any previous experience with 100% pure raw shea butter, so I have nothing to compare this to and I'm not sure if it's pure and raw, but it sure seems like it. I love this product. It's VERY cheap (compared to my l'occitane that contains ""high (25%) concentration of shea butter"" which I get for $42/7oz), and for me the quality feels great. I would highly recommend this for people who use expensive shea cream like me! Add some essential oils, add it to a lotion, or use it as is. It's awesome! I put it on all over my body after taking a shower, and def too heavy, too greasy! I keep it in my fridge so it won't buttery melt, summer time over here and our bedroom is the whole attic of the house, air conditioner gets turned off when no one is home so it can get up to 80 degrees fahrenheit up here. I offered to put it on the hubby after he gets out of the shower, at first he was scared since it came with some weird take out plastic container and also he did see it in the fridge earlier. I rubbed it on him and sure enough our sheets had blots of oil on it. I read some reviews about how it's hard to put it on your skin as it crumbles up and also you have to put some heat so it'll be easier to apply. I didn't find it that way, at least for myself I didn't. I just take about nickel or quarter size and put it on my palms and rub my palms together. With the heat and the friction from your own body warms it up and the results are amazingly spreadable!All in all I did gave it 4 stars since even tho the hubby and I feels greasy for the first 4-5 mins, when it absorbs in our skin it actually made my hubby's skin non-ashy for the whole day. My feet smoother, great for elbows and knees. I follow it up with 100% Organic Jojoba oil so the results are TERRIFIC!Havent had a chance to put it on the kids but it'll prob give out good results."
455,B000X2H6R0,"I was very happy once this product came in the mail. I absolutely love anything coconut so this was perfect for me. Once I opened up the product I immediately smelled the coconut which was great. It may be a bit to strong for some people though. I evenly applied the product to my hair and left it on for about 5 minutes. I rinsed it out and my hair was very soft. Once I dried my hair it was still soft and still smelled like coconuts which was nice. My hair is naturally curly, frizzy, thick, and dry. My only cons with this product is that I don't really like the container it's in and how the product seems a bit watered down. I wish the product was a little bit thicker. All in all I think its a great deep conditioner and recommend it to anyone with hair like mine or for someone who just has dry hair. After seeing several of my fave beauty gurus online mention Coconut Milk, I stumbled upon another fashion blogger who explicitly mentioned this product that has helped her maintain her 3b/3a hair. Okay, knowing that my hair is a 4c, I thought I would give this product a try, using it primarily as a deep conditioner and or leave-in conditioner. LOVE LOVE the smell of this product but the consistency of this product put me off. It was very liquid-y (moreso than I would anticipate for something that is ""milk"" based). I do not use this product everyday but when I do I love the way it smells and how weightless it feels on my hair. It doesn't weigh my hair down but it also hasn't really done anything to improve the condition of my hair. Since purchasing this item, I am now half way done with this milk product but I am not too sure if I would buy it again?? It just smells and feels great but I don't really believe it actually has help grow my hair or improve the condition of my hair or strengthen it, but thats just me =/ Bought this product 2 years ago,  it sat around, finally used it and loved it.  Could not find in a store but was lucky to find it on Amazon.  Was not the same.  Not asthick.  Did not condition my hair as expected.  Tried It's a Ten Hair Mask and whao, what a difference.  No more snarls and dryness.  A little more money but worth it. I have thick hair and I really like the OGX coconut milk products. I was a little disappointed with this one. It was not the best daily conditioner but if I left it on for an hour it would make my hair feel nice. I do think that this product goes well with the regular coconut milk conditioner OGX has. I most likely will not be buying this again but I will use it up. Normally I use the regular shampoo and conditioner for this line. I also use the macadamia nut deep conditioner. I thought I would try this instead. The results were not to my expectations. My hair was not as soft as when I use the macadamia nut product. It did smell very nice and was shiny though. I have very curly, kinky, dry and frizzy African hair and I was never happy with any product until I tried this. It gives my hair the daily moisture it needs and gives it shine and restores a healthy looking curl. The bonus is that I get compliments on how my hair looks now, which never happened before, and how my hair smells great! I ordered two jars of this because I never want to run out of it. I think I'll start using the shampoo and conditioner from this product line as well since I am so satisfied with the treatment. I purchased this product due to the other great experiences I have had with OGX coconut milk products.  Needless to say I was quite disappointed.  It didn't give the nourishing repair as what was expected, more like a general basic conditioner. A positive is that it smells beyond amazing! Works for softening and rejuvenating coarse hair. Should let it sit for a long time though for best results. Very good, not a miracle, and I wish it were heavier and creamier because it leaves my hair too bouncy when I rinse it out."
456,B0009DVDTU,"Have been using for many years. It seems to be doing the job. When I use this, I have less puffiness on my lower eyes. It was recommended by a dermatologist. This is an awesome product for an absolutes steal. I was so excited to use this product however, it really dried out my skin. Make sure to consult your doctor. Enjoy. I have used this for years and swear by it to help decrease the appearance of dark circles under my eyes.  A little expensive but a jar lasts me almost a year so very worth the price.  Helps reduce fine lines as well. I didn't notice it helping with the dark circles, puffiness or fine lines.  I only used it for about a week but I started noticing a redness under my eyes .  Have it 3 stars because I don't know if it would've helped had I been able to use it longer No noticeable improvement in under eye circles but feels very very nice on my sensitive skin so i purchased a second jar. No stinky smell. no allergic reaction and I’m allergic to most everything. Great Product I purchased this from Skin, Inc. on Amazon and the product is legit.  I have used this product for over 5 years and swear by it.  I have extreme dark circles that circle my under eye and puff up into my cheek. - this is largely hereditary.  This is the only product, and I have tried many salon and boutique brands, that works!  I use it twice a day, and the jar lasts approx 6 months.  After about 2-3 months you can use it once per day and use something else the other time.  I usually do not do this, preferring to use this 2 times per day, so my results are based on this.The change is not overnight but subtle over time!  The first time I bought it I was questioning it's value about 1-2 months into it.  I asked my husband and daughter what they thought and they both soundly agreed that the product was making a real difference.  Two times over the last 5 years I have stopped using it in favor of other products and both times it was a mistake!  After about 3-6 months my dark circles appeared more noticeable.  My point is, stick with it.  You will not see immediate or drastic results - but one day you will look in the mirror and notice an overall improvement -  or others will complement you.I was hesitant to order from Amazon since very few retailers other than Dermatologists carry this.  I ordered this from Skin, Inc. and it is legit.  The box was sealed.  The product does not have an expiration date (and never did before) so I cannot confirm if the products age, but all appears fine, the color, consistency, and packaging appear new."
457,B000NN7FSO,"Update after 2 months:No new breakouts. More scars from the purge than I would like but they seem to be healing and fade a lot quicker. Still happy to continue to use this twice a day as I think it’s stopped the outbreaks, just need to generate new skin and fade these scars and get my skin into the promised land we all dream of. So far so good.Update after 6 weeks:Great stuff. No new breakouts. Purge has virtually disappeared, only have one spot that’s drying up. Skin feels good and tight and looks more even in color. I like that it’s dried my skin a little (in a good way and not irritating, like I said earlier adjust the amount and how often you use it at first and listen to your skin then increase it), I was always oily and feel this controls that and cleans out my pores. Now I’m working on lightening up dark scars with some Kojic acid cream. Continuing to use this twice daily as I’m not breaking out anymore. Stick it out.Original review:Great stuff. Never used anything like this before. Was breaking out on my forehead and temples for years. For the first week i jumped in and I used it twice a day and it seemed to control the oil on my face, I had a bunch of new white heads break out in the normal areas but they seemed to dry up within a couple of days - they disappeared a lot quicker than they normally would have. Second week, no new breakouts, skin seems to have cleared up and it’s keeping new stuff from starting. I think the acid does the actual exfoliating not the beads everyone keeps talking about, it has some biodegradable scrub like stuff in it but the acid is the thing that’s working. I did notice in the first week I couldn’t use it under the eyes or top of the cheeks or nose due to excessive drying but now I can. My advice is try it once a day or a few times a week first. See what dries out and what doesn’t and adapt how you use it, use it where you get no problems and use less in areas that seem overly dry. It really works. I think I had an oil problem and probably skin blocking up pores. Recommend it and I recommend sticking it out to see if the initial “purge” goes away. Mine did. The consistency is too watery. It does the job . My face feels clean. It helps the black spots to lighten. Moisturizes and exfoliates well. Product goes on easily but it has a smell I don't like at all. I haven't seen any changes but I  just started using it a week ago I have suffered from hyper-pigmentation for years, 10+. I can honestly say this line of products is the only one that has given me true results, this quick, with no adverse reactions. I use the coco butter soap bar first on all my effected areas, then using a soft brush exfoliator , i use the Ambi Even & Clear Exfoliating Wash for a minute, i do these steps in the shower daily. Once out of the shower, i use Ambi Even & Clear Fade cream every night and each morning as well on freshly washed skin. I have never seen my skin begin to clear up this quickly. Some spots i've been dealing with since 2019 are beginning to fade right in front of me. I am sooo excited to finally be on the road to even clear skin. As the directions say, start off using the fade cream and the exfoilationg wash once a day and then progress to twice a day to make sure your skin isn't effected my the ingredients. It came package well wrapped in plastic safely, but the consistency is something I’m struggling with as I am use to creamy thick face scrubs and this one is white and runny. I’m going with the idea that it’s for a “gentle” exfoliation and if I use that thought I will finish the bottle. As far as cleansing- not real impressed on that level either, but mix with another face scrub oddly enough I’m pleased with the outcome. It does not have a smell. Fairly easy to rinse off. I’m on the fence.. if you used other products in this line then you may have your mindset already… if not I would say… honestly you could probably live without ever trying this particular item. It was worth the try for the price. Very gentle. I first use Ambi bar soap to wash my face before using this exfoliating scrub with a facial sponge. It makes my skin feel really soft, and it does reduce the occurrence of acne. Love it This is a good product. It makes my face feels so smooth after using it and it also helps with my blemishes. Definitely recommend"
458,B000ZECIDS,"Feels different from last year or so ! I bought this the same time I purchased the ""(African) Black Body Wash"" from this brand (via VitaCost). At the time, I was in the process of changing over my regular skin care products in favor of ones more natural. This looked like it would fit the bill, being that the front label states ""Certified Organic Ingredients"". (NOTE: The ""Honey & Black Seed"" only contains ONE ingredient that fits that description-- Shea butter.)I thought both might work as a facial soap (and thankfully were much cheaper than my old chemical based face soap). However, after trying the ""Black"" wash on my face, I found that I was wrong. Both soaps have a fragrance to them that lingers long after it's rinsed off (refer to my review on the ""African Black Body Wash""). So (BE ADVISED) if you're in any way sensitive to semi-strong/lingering fragrance, you may want to steer clear of these soaps!!(Even though the ""Skin Type"" listed on the back of the ""Honey & Black Seed"" is for ""Sensitive, All Skin Types"".)I think the ""Honey & Black Seed"" may be a tad less potent (fragrant) than the ""Black"", but not much. It seems to be less water based than the ""Black"", and has a thick & sticky feel; both are sudsy. I have used it in my hair along with shampoo to make it stretch- with success (meaning it doesn't make it look dull or overly greasy looking).With that said I'm not really keen on trying another soap from this company; nor and am likely not to re-purchase either soap again.I have since found a couple of other soaps that I like for my face (one being ""Ilumina Organics Head To Toe Baby Wash with Aloe""); and as for a body soap, I'll continue to use ""Kirk's Castile"" (coconut) bar soap *fragrance free*.Here is the COMPLETE list, if you'd like to know the exact INGREDIENTS:""Cocoamidopropyl Betaine (Coconut Oil Soap), Decyl Glucoside (Sugar Beets), Lauroyl Lactylate (Palm Kernel), Deionized Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Honey, Apricot Seed Oil, Black Seed Oil, Lonicerna Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract"". ""*"" means ""Certified Organic Ingredients"".Note: Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract is actually a (natural) paraben.  For more info go to organicconsumers (DOT) org/articles/article_17679.cfm  *no spaces, add . * Amazing scent and your body will feel moisturized after you dry off. I only gave this one four stars because the honey sticks to itself and then the body wash element separates and so you have these clumps of honey on your body that aren't combining with the body wash very well. I overall love the smell of the product and I don't know if it something I did or something that happened in shipping but it's just strange and makes it hard for the product to spread over your body. I got this because I love the deodorant and I was excited to have a matching deodorant and body wash but I found I'm not using the body wash as often as I want to.  I tried shaking the bottle before used thinking maybe they're just settling and I need to shake the bottle to combine them back together but it didn't make a difference. But I will still be checking out more products from this line because they're amazing! I love this body wash. It leaves my skin feeling nourished and soft, clean, but not over cleaned and dry. It seems to be helping clear up my kp (used in conjunction with gentle scrubbing gloves) and has cleared up the minor acne I was getting on my back (used in conjunction with a natural hair long handled back brush). The smell of the wash is pleasant, kind of calming, but maybe a hair too sweet smelling (probably the honey). It foams enough that you can see you still have some on your body scrubber, which is nice and I don't have to use a lot of product so I think this bottle will last me awhile. (I've used a lot of natural body washes that don't foam at all). Plus, it's got an EWG rating of 2, so I feel comfortable putting it on my skin. I love this brand and this product.  The ingredients are plant-based and cruelty free.  The company values and honors the rich resources and people of northern/western Africa; the founders are from Liberia.  The company supports the people whose nations provide the raw materials for each product, and also supports several community projects.So the company believes in things that I support.  On top of that, they make great body washes and lotions.  The scents are strong and delicious; with the wash, a little goes a long way.  Same with the lotions, which are thick and cream like frosting.The washes rinse off easily but the lovely perfumes linger.  The lotions stay put and keep my skin hydrated all day/night. Read other amazing reviews and the product did not disappoint. It leaked a little in shipping but still amazing and will be buying again. I started using this body wash 2 years ago and I have reordered it twice. It has taken care of a skin itch that I had been dealing with for several years. It has a very pleasant smell and leaves my skin soft."
459,B000146LKS,"Soothing and relaxing. I recommend Love the smell of patchouli I bought this soap because I loved the scent when I used it years ago. There’s hardly any scent any more. It came in a double wrapped plastic wrapper. I don’t know if the manufacturer is cutting costs, but I will not be buying this soap anymore. NOPE. I LOVE this soap!  Patchouli has a very distinct smell and you either like it or you hate it.  I like it and it is very hard to find.  I found this brand at a local store that never has the same inventory and the next week the Patchouli was all gone.  I frantically looked for it online and found it here on Amazon - YaY!  I love this stuff.  The soap itself is really nice and does not produce a filmy mess like some soaps do and it has the perfect amount of fragrance.This soap comes packaged very nice and would make a nice gift (if your recipient is a lover of Patchouli!).  I also like to put a bar of this in my chest of drawers to make my clothes smell nice and on a closet shelf because it makes my closet smell heavenly.  I also have one in my center console in my car because it makes the whole car smell nice and isn't overpowering.Glad I was able to find this on Amazon - it's a GREAT product!  :) I've been using Plant Life soaps for a couple years now.  I don't love spending $7 for a bar of soap, but I think it's worth it.  They do last a surprisingly long time. It leaves my skin super soft, and the scents they offer are natural as opposed to weird and artificial smelling.  Patchouli, Sandalwood, and Cedar are my favorites.... like a walk in the woods. I just love this product. First off, let me say I absolutely love patchouli.  I find it difficult to locate good smelling patchouli...anything.  I have purchased products from PlantLife before and been pleased.  I must admit that when I bought this particular soap, I was skeptical.  I had never smelled the patchouli sent from PlantLife before and with patchouli, you never know what you are going to get.This scent was wonderful and earthy and everything I could have hoped for.  The scent lingers on your skin after your shower but is not a heavy, cloying, overwhelming smell which I appreciate.  It is also not weighed down by a bunch of other ""filler"" scents.  It does not leave any type of chemical or manufactured smell.  The soap itself is great quality as I expect from previous experience with PlantLife products.I also like the simple packaging and the lack of a bunch of dyes and coloring that manufacturers often put into their products to give visual appeal (lavender soap is lavender colored, rose is pink, cucumber is green, etc.).  All of Plantlife's products are natural and non-irritating and this particular one is no exception.  I will happily purchase this particular soap again. Excellent Hard to find in the store.  Not drying and real patchouli scent but not overpowering."
460,B0009BVK0E,"Yes, as some people have said, this soap is a bit stinky, but not so stinky that it's repulsive.  When you first start using it you think ""Oh, this isn't so bad.""  But, then you're soaking and you start to smell this slightly musty peanut smell.. But, it so doesn't matter when you learn what it does for your skin!  This soup is also suitable for conscientious people, when it comes to their own health and even the environment.. and washing with it feels SO GOOD.. the lather is rich and creamy and... I just can not put it to words, you have to feel it! It's vegan safe, paraben, sulfate, and gluten free.So, what's in it? Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Melia Azadirachta (Neem) Seed Oil, Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Hydroxide, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract.Benefits of the Ingredients:Olive Oil:Olive oil has the same healthy fats as avocado, and plumps and moisturizes the skin with a combination of vitamin E and vitamin A.  Vitamin E is an antioxidant.. which combats against free radicals, free radicals aid in the formation of cancer, and unsightly wrinkles.Coconut Oil:Coconut oil also helps to delay the occurrence of wrinkles because it contains antioxidant Vitamin E, known to protect skin cells from damage over time. The Vitamin E found in coconut oil soothes eczema, sunburn and psoriasis, and its antiviral and antifungal benefits even help to treat bug bites.  Coconut oil contains 3 fatty acids: capric acid, lauric acid and caprylic acid. Each of these acids kill candida, a common cause of fungal infection on your skin.Palm Oil:Lipids in our skin can be damaged or oxidized by ozone exposure, which can lead to free radicals being generated in our skin. Palm oil can fight free radicals, but it can also prevent them from forming in the first place. The oxidation of lipilds resulting in free radicals have been proven to be an underlying cause of many skin diseases, including cancer. Toctrienols have been proven to be 40 to 60 times more powerful than the common tocopherol in preventing lipid preoxidation.Neem Oil:Sometimes the best way to know what Neem Oil helps is to ask what it doesn't help.. lol!  Neem oil, is amazing. Due to the healing properties of neem, it's useful in treating a variety of skin conditions and is especially effective in treating those who don't respond to typical medical treatment. Neem is used to treat such skin conditions as acne, psoriasis, eczema, ringworm, scabies, and warts. It's also beneficial in treating the scalp for dandruff and scaling, as well as head lice. Neem is beneficial to skin by helping heal minor scrapes and skin abrasions because of its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It is the Neem Oil that lends to the soap's slightly musty peanut smell.  If you were to smell pure Neem Oil, you would say this soap is the best smelling thing ever.. Pure Neem is the Super Hero of Stink.. but it's also the Super Hero of Oils.. :)  It is WISE to do research on Neem Oil if you are going to use it.. as it should NEVER be used in its undiluted form, or by women who are looking to get pregnant, are pregnant or are breast feeding.. Neem has a natural contraceptive property that is not only effective on pests, but also on humans, Neem Oil has been used as a birth control method for thousands of years in India.. I repeat NEVER use Neem Oil without diluting it.. This soap is just fine, the Neem is diluted in other carrier oils.  ^_^Shea Butter:Shea butter is chock-full of vitamin A and is deeply moisturizing. Shea is derived from nuts that grow on trees in West and Central Africa, and it is known for being so nourishing to the skin that even in Africa's dry climate it works to soothe thirsty skin. The American Shea Institute notes that shea butter possesses the ability to improve pesky skin blemishes, eczema, wrinkles and dermatitis. Shea is also known to soothe insect bites, sunburn and frostbite. This butter packs a powerful punch for an array of skin ailments.Jojoba Oil:A natural emollient, jojoba oil's similarity to sebum allows it to absorb easily and readily into your skin, making it a gentle, skin-softening moisturizer for all skin types. It also helps to combat acne and treats skin infections.Rosemary Extract:Not only does it smell nice (which helps cut down on the funk of this soap *grin*), Rosemary oil tones and firms the skin. The herb is an astringent, helping to reduce excess oil in skin and hair. Rosemary tones and firms sagging skin, and it is used as an ingredient in anti-aging products. The disinfectant and antibiotic properties of rosemary contribute to its use for treating acne, dermatitis and eczema.This soap has it all, and I love it, and I plan on ordering about 20 bars to keep in my bathroom so there is always a bar when I run out of one.. I will never, again, use another soap.  I have been SUFFERING from terribly dry skin, from hormonal changes, and these DREADFUL New England winters.. My skin was itchy, tight, and dry.. I did nothing but scratch day in and day out.. I used this soap and the intensity of the itch was GREATLY reduced!  After one use!  I got in a tub of warm water, washed as normal, and then laid in the soapy water for hours, reading a book.  I only got out when the water got cold, and then I followed up with the Organix, Theraneem Skin Lotion, 8 Ounce.. You can find that here too at varying prices on Amazon.I come from a country where having beautiful skin is KING.. we go through a 5 step skin care regime daily to maintain stunning skin.. This did SO MUCH for my skin, even parts of my skin (after having a child) that felt a bit unfirm, have firmed up.. It's not even advertised as doing such.. but it did for me.. I LOVE this soap!  And I will tell all my friends about it, though many are stubborn and probably wouldn't try it, because they can't see spending 7+ dollars on a bar of soap.. but, it's worth it..BUY IT! <3 Highly recommend once you start to enjoy the smell.  It can be intense at first, but the benefits outweigh the scent!  It is amazing for dry acne prone skin!  10/10 highly recommend!  Give it a try! I have been using this soap for about 6 weeks now. I bought this soap along with other Neem products to combat a scabies infestation. Neem does not kill scabies directly, it disrupts their hormone cycle and causes them to eventually die. It also does not kill eggs, so to use it for scabies, you would have to use it for several weeks. Frankly, I bought it to repair the damage from the prescription scabies medicines I was using. Those left my skin dry, raw, and extremely irritated. Additionally, I have mild acne, and dry skin also. First, understand that nothing is a miracle cure, and there is no cure for acne. Second, don't always listen to your dermatologist. I am in the medical field myself. If someone asks me about a product I don't know, I tell them I don't know, and then I research it myself. Someone told me of the benefits of Neem, so I researched it myself. I asked my dermatologist about it. He had not heard of it. Rather than saying, ""I'll look into it and let you know my professional opinion,"" he summarily dismissed it as hooey, b/c it was a ""natural"" product. Many of the prescription meds out there are gotten from plants, so there is no reason to dismiss a product simply b/c you haven't heard of it. Anyway, third, the smell. The smell of the soap is not nearly as bad as the pure oil. Not by a long shot, and you do get used to it after a little while. It's best described as a mix of rancid garlic, mixed with rotten peanuts. As I said tho, it's not nearly as strong as the oil, and really doesn't smell that bad. Finally, how does it work? Excellent. One reviewer commented that it took longer to work than was expected. Yes, it is not a miracle that will cure you overnight. For me, it took about 3-4 weeks to truly start working. My acne has diminished greatly. I have only mild acne, so don't expect major results if you have bad acne. I also had several areas of dry, red, patchy skin on my upper arms. It took about a month, but these patches are now gone completely, and the redness is about 98% reduced. My skin is no longer as irritated and itchy as it was either. The bars last a long time too, generally 30 showers or so. I will now be using this as my regular soap. In summation, this is a great all around soap that will effectively treat a myriad of skin problems. Just don't expect a miracle cure, and you have to stick with it. If you do, you may just be amazed at the results. This stuff is pricier than some other options, by quite a bit, but it is consistent and works WONDERS.My skin is ultra sensitive, and I get body acne in random spots. Someone told me to try neem soap, and I found this brand. I first tried some in a pack from a market by my house and they were inconsistent & smelly.This one has the neem scent, but it is mild and doesn't stay on my body for long. Lots of other great oils in it that are very moisturizing. I use with exfoliating gloves, and am in love. I bought three backups. Exfoliating and getting rid of skin parasites didn't work all that well but helped some. My child has sensitive skin and this soap works awesome on her face! It helps keep her face smooth and keeps blemishes at bay. If you struggle with acne this soap is for you. I used it years ago but recently bought it for my daughter to try. She didn't want to try it and I was having a little bit of issues from using hair products I'm sensitive to (Someday I'll learn to just stop using them!) sooo I started using it on my face again and my skin looks great. Neem is so good for your skin! Get past the weird smell, it's not crazy awful, just not a nice pretty scent like we're used to. It's worth it! I've used neem for years to heal my skin and also to protect it, especially during the summer months.  This soap lathers well and smells really nice.  The scent is very light and smells like neem."
461,B000GDDKJO,"This is a product that does exactly what it says.  I use it about once per week and haven't been disappointed.  I don't have skin problems but lately I've been getting more than my fair share of pimples and was looking for a product I could add to my skin care regimen.  This product does the trick - my only suggestion, especially if you have sensitive skin, is to follow the directions carefully and be sure to not leave the mask on for longer than 10 minutes.  Also, I find that it's not really a good cleanser, so if you have oily skin you might want to wash your face first using a very small amount of your normal cleanser, rinse, and then apply the mask at the end of your day.  The mask will get rid of the pimples and slow down their desire to form and the results should be noticeable in the morning.  Last but not least, no product will ever work effectively if we don't provide the proper, natural care for our skin which means in addition to using this product, drink plenty of water - making sure that your water intake surpasses the consumption of all other beverages AND get plenty of rest.  This is the real secret to beautiful skin. I have small blackheads around my nose and the slope of my face leading to my nose. This mask is really good for treating these areas and blackheads specifically.It’s really great for reducing redness and evening out my skin tone.I use it for spot treatment overnight which works well too.I wouldn’t recommend this to someone with dry skin as it can really dry out my skin if I don’t moisturize well enough after using this.I use a mask probably once every other week and I leave it on at least for 40 minutes.I suggest using a light exfoliating method of washing the face afterwards. I use purpose face soap and a hand towel which works well for me. I have had inflammatory adult acne for years. I put it on a few times a week overnight and the next morning my pimples have shrunken, redness less, and overall clearer. This is the only acne product I use currently. I don't use any acne cleansers or spot treatment (this is my spot treatment as well). (This might sound really like a no-no but I sometimes squeeze painful, bulging pimples and then I put Murad clay mask on overnight.) It also works on large pores with junk in it. I got off my 2nd round of Accutane over 2 years ago. My coworkers and friends have commented on how much smoother, clearer my skin is. I recommended this clay mask to a teenage son of my colleague and her son's skin after a few weeks of Murad sulfur clay mask improved too and he stopped having bigger whiteheads. I also told a friend about it and it also worked on her cystic acne. Totally worth it! A tube lasts for months. I have suffered from cystic acne since I was a teenager, and I have used all sorts of acne creams, used alcohol, peroxide, I've been to a skin doctor and none of the medicines have helped my cystic acne I get on my chin. I would go weeks with it hurting and not going away, or when it finally went away another came back. I bought this murad on a Thursday. It's not Monday and my cystic acne I had is almost gone. I am so happy with this product and would purchase it again. The slight sulfur smell isn't as bad as some say you, you get use to it by the second time you use it After using this for a month or so, my acne has became way better and it help get rid of it fast. Very happy about my purchase and I would highly recommend it. Although this is a mask, I only use it as a spot treatment and leave it on over night. In the morning I wash it off with a cleanser and it usually takes most of it off. My skin is dry and I do moisturize a lot and only use this product 3 times a week but it doesn't leave my skin dry. I love it. I have cystic acne, but after seeing an asthetician for a year and using murad products, I no longer have as many breakouts and when i do have a bad breakout, I use this mask.  It does have a smell that lingers on your skin thats sulfur like if you use it like a mask, even after moisterizing.  However, I find the best use of this to be if you get a really red cystic breakout, you can use it to spot treat your acne before bed and leave it on the affected areas all night and the swelling from the inflammation does subside by morning.  You don't need to use a lot of this so it lasts awhile, which makes me feel better about the price of it. Then shower, use your normal cleansers, treatments and moisterizers and you are good to go. I have used this product for myself and my teenage son. It has been very effective for both of us. It goes a long way toward clearing up my son's teen acne and helps to keep my oily skin clear. I also use other Murad products on a daily basis, but my son usually does not. If you need a deeper treatment than your daily cleanser, this mask works well. If you are prone to breakouts, you might want to give yourself a few days after using in case this brings deeper impurities up to the surface as breakouts after first use. (So if you have school pictures or a big event, use this a few days in advance to ensure clearer skin the day of the event.) I can usually find Murad products on Amazon for less than it is sold in stores or spas. I suffer from monthly breakouts starting the week before my period. I use this as a spot treatment and wear it overnight. It does seem to help dry out the pimples a little, but it doesn't make them disappear. I have friends that swear by this product. Topical treatments have never worked at all for me in the past. I'm giving it three stars because it does seems to help a little - more than any other spot treatment I've tried, including expensive prescription ones. It's not a miracle treatment but it does help. I'd say it's worth a try, especially if your skin has been receptive to topical solutions in the past. It might be better to try and get a free sample to see if it works for you before paying full price for a whole tube. I've heard they carry samples of this at Sephora."
462,B001EJXCH4,"I finally found one that works with my eczema! You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find something that actually works. My skin feels fantastic after using it. Customer for life! Good product Good product Good product for my sensitive skin. I only buy Tone, which is the best soap for me for a number of reasons. It checks off all the boxes for the best soap.1. The bar itself is bigger than other brands and it’s just the right shape in terms of the design, which fits perfectly in your hand and doesn’t have those clunky edges like some soap that comes shaped as rectangles.2. Tone soap is moisturizing for your skin with vitamin E and cocoa butter, but it still creates a great lather unlike some other brands such as Dove that moisturizes but doesn’t feel like soap because it doesn’t lather. Dove seems like I’m a bar of solid bar of moisturizing lotion instead of soap.3. The scent is great. It’s a combination of coconut and cocoa seed butter. There is also papaya fruit extract in the soap, but I don’t smell it.This soap is definitely worth your money. A+ i LOVE THIS BODY WASH! Its so silky and luxurious. A little goes a long way so its a great value too. I never see Tone in the store anymore. Maybe it's because I just don't see it because I go straight to one brand or another, but it popped up in my feed when I was shopping for that stuff.I noticed the price first, and that's what put it in my cart. Once I received it, the product spoke for itself and I keep putting in my cart!I bought the blue Hawaiian something scent first, and this time tried the coconutty kind - both smell amazing, and have a lasting, but not overpowering scent.It's nice and thick, lathers up to great bubbles, and rinses away clean, but leaves my skin moisturized. Everything you need from your body wash at a fraction of the price! I'll let you know what scent I get next 🤗 I love this body wash it is in my top favorites I try to buy it as much as I can"
463,B001HITLQI,"I give it three stars due to the poor delivery and execution of the seller. I ordered from this particular seller and received an open bottle. The seller taped the box and the plastic wrap, but not the nozzle of the bottle to prevent loose cap. The cap was very loose. The seller didn't even bother tightening the nozzle. Pathetic. Now I only got 6oz of the stuff instead of 8oz. I'm very disappointed.Lately I don't know what is happening with Amazon and places like it (it is happening everywhere, in fact)... but service and courtesy towards customers has gone down dramatically. Seriously! It's like these people don't care for their work or something. If you can't do it well, don't do it at all. Let those who truly care have the job. These sellers even have the audacity to argue with the buyer over things that the buyer have clear evidence, beyond substantial (actual photos and such). I could go on, but lets get with how great this product is.I am in love with Dr.Bronner's products. I heard great things about them, especially their fair trade and the no animal testing part, and it is made in the USA. Wow! Dr. Bronner's has it all. A soap, if get the water mixture correct, can be used for anything from body wash to hair wash to washing laundry and more. A washing conditioner (haven't tried it yet but will). Lotions of all sorts. I just love the fact this company follows the same values as I do. I think testing on animals for cosmetics is irrational. Treatment of employees should be mindful and respect, with dignity and fair pay. The product made in the USA that has ingredients I can read and know (I could make it at home). On top of all that and more, this company serves the country by giving 40% of its revenue to charities, schools or other public facilities to improve them. Putting money back into the people who use and support their brand. How awesome is that!?The products aren't just good for animals, people, environment and the wallet (a little goes a long way and a gallon bottle of their soap lasts for 6 months or so). I tried their soap and it's awesome. Got rid of my problem skin fast and no more issues on my hands, due to harsh chemicals from other cleaning brands. That soap is multipurpose and a small amount is all one needs. This lotion is no exception. A single pump, about a quarter size amount, is enough to cover my whole 4ft 10inch body, and a small tiny pump, nickel size amount, is enough to use on my hair, especially at the ends. That is right, you can use it on your hair too. I figured since this stuff is basically made of the same stuff as Bronner's Hair Lotion, I told myself after a shower, ""Why not the hair?"" A tiny amount is all I need. Granted my hair is at shoulder length for some hair strands and just slightly at the collarbone for other strands, I do have tons of hair strands (in a small ponytail I have an inch thickness). I have bleached out silver blonde hair, which I retouch the roots once month to every two months. This product doesn't discolor the hair nor make it dull as other lotions do. I think it's the oils within the product that add shine to the hair strands. My hair feels like hair after using this. I had used other products from big name hair companies and my hair either gets very dry, fuzzy, oily, dull looking or my hair color alters dramatically. My hair would feel worse after using those big top name brands at drug stores and such. I don't get those nasty side effects after using Bronner's All-One lotion for the body. After two weeks my hair feels thicker and healthier, even at the ends. WHAT!? Even so-called colorists are shocked at how healthy even my ends are. It is beneficial for these people to convince people to come to their place and fix the damage by chopping your hair off and recoloring it, so you can spend over $100 for their ""kind"" serve. Between my own tiny half an inch trim - you say 1/2 an inch to a salon lady and you'll get a huge 4 inch chop, plus a style that really doesn't go with your face at all - anyways, between giving myself a tiny trim and Dr. Bronner's lotion, my hair feels like unbleached out hair, new. Please keep in mind I did used a tiny amount of Wild Growth Hair Oil (white and green bottle) in my hair before applying this over. I'm so glad to have found this and using it. My skin seems to like it too. No more ashy, scaly elbows and knees. My skin looks and feels better than when I was 15 years old. Amazing.Again, the result for the low score was the horrible delivery service. Granted, a little goes a long way, but still I paid for 8oz of the stuff not 6oz. If the seller did a better job, I give this the full five stars. I bought this lotion after doing much research. I wanted a better and healthier alternative to the additive laden most products seem to be. Smells nice and seems to work well. Does not irritate my skin and seems to be helping with the dryness. Only reason I left off one star was the weak packaging. It came is a plastic bag with the lid half unscrewed. There was lotion leaking out around the lid. Also, no safety seal. So I am just hoping this is legit and glad only a little lotion leaked out. In this day and age, I would like to have seen a safety seal and some kind of package instead of a plastic bag. I thought the Lime smell would be passive, but I've got to tell you it's a strong smell. I do like this product but I must say that if your hands are chapped or cracked the peppermint stings! Feels very smooth and nice when it goes on but by the next morning my hands were dry again so I guess not long lasting… don’t think I’ll buy it again and I’ll stick with NOWS Cocoa butter or Vit e hand cream. I'm confused on this product. It goes on beautifully. Smells good too but, for some reason my hands feel dry after putting in on. I haven’t had a chance to try the lotion yet, but I know I won’t be repurchasing because of the way I received the lotion. I read some reviews and understand I’m not the first customer who received it half way open with the lotion leaked and spread all over the wrapping nylon. It’s sloppy and unacceptable, I don’t know how much lotion leaked from the bottle but it’s a waste of MY money. I’m not happy Patchouli seems to have a lovely it or hate it reaction with most people. The lime changes it just enough that everyone tells me how good I smell. I love this product as well at Dr Bronner's hair cream is also wonderful.  You just feel healthy using the stuff even if you aren't.  Now I love patchouli and you can smell it with this one (though there is also a Lavendar one as well) so be warned just in case you are not a fan or are around people who will complain!  It is kind of thin and watery but not in a bad way...more in a oil kind of way.  I love it and will continue to buy it again along with the hair cream and his bar soaps....highly recommend...."
464,B000WOU3I8,"Love these.  Can't find them to purchase in local store anymore. These wipes are perfect for travel, post-workout and when you need to remove makeup/dirt, but can’t wash your face. I have sensitive skin that’s fair, so it shows ANY irritation I get that’s even mild and these wipes don’t irritate my skin at all and remove all of my makeup - even stubborn waterproof mascara. Scent is very mild (preference for me bc fragrance can bother my skin) and I only have to use 1 wipe to completely clean my face and rid of makeup. Initially, they can leave your face feeling a very mild “filmy” feeling, but that goes away completely in a minute or two after drying. If that feeling of having a film lasted, I wouldn’t recommend these, but they work great! Strong enough to use both sides without tearing or drying up & removes all makeup. Those late nights after work or going out when you’re too tired/lazy to fully wash your face? These are lifesavers for those nights! Highly recommend! The products arrived on time as scheduled and was packed great where the wipes would not dry out.  I have sensitive skin so I am also nervous when trying new products.  I was sweaty from working out and had some light makeup on when I first tried the wipes.  I applied the wipe and I can honesty say that the wipes do what they say. The peppermint is not too strong but it's light enough where it leaves a refreshing feeling.  My face felt clean after using the wipes!  I will definitely be using these in my nightly routine even when I don't wear makeup.  Highly recommend to someone looking for a new staple product to include in their beauty regimen!The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is because the sealant for the wipes dispenser didn't seal the best for traveling purposes. I have dry to combination skin and am acne prone. These wipes are very gentle to the touch. They glide across the skin very nicely, so no tugging or harsh rubbing is necessary to remove your makeup. This prevents acne and is great for sensitive skin. It also leave the skin feeling soft and refreshed.The reason why I removed one star is the scent of the product is a bit strong when first applied. Once it has completely dried, the scent does fade, leaving a more subtle fragrance. I have purchased others products from this brand in the past and understand that this is likely their signature scent. If you're not sensitive to a bit of fragrance, then this should not be an issue.Overall, great product! Perfect for those late nights when you're too tired to wash your face. Or even for those on the go, who need a little refreshing. Packaging is slim and fits conveniently in any purse.QUICK TIP: Flip packaging upside down, that way the product evenly distributes throughout the wipes. This way the bottom wipes won't be overly soiled and the top wipes won't be dry. It works fine. I feel a little guilty every time I use one and throw it away when I just could have used a simple washcloth. Also, the way to open and reseal this is awkward. I seems as if I've thrown the seal away? Not sure. Eye happy with this oroduct Nice product to take off makeup. Would like to have been more thick, but does the job. Great for sensitive skin and no fragrance. It does take off my makeup and feels good on my skin. It does not irritate, no real scent, it is soft snd easy to travel with. However I do need more than one."
465,B000J41UO2,"Awesome soap! Large bar, very creamy, great lather, and oh my god I love the scent. Just strong enough — not overbearing!  Will order again! I liked how silky it feels and how I can still lightly smell it on my skin after I get out of the shower.  It's not an overpowering scent on my skin, just a pleasant warm shea butter. I like the frankincense and myrrh sent and it's a big bar of soap that moisturizes as you clean I like this Soap a lot, but I’m conflicted on the fact that definitely sells itself as a Black  owned business/product while it’s anything but. I mean,  it's called ""Nubian Heritage"" with an African Adinkra symbol on the box,  but the company is based in Sweden. I have only bought this product when it’s on a steep sale because of this. 5 stars for the actual product,  but -2 stars for the manipulative sales practice I am absolutely in love with this soap, and most of the nubian soaps.  It makes my skin so soft, it also lathers really nice. The scent is pretty strong and lasts, make sure you like the scent.  It’s my new favorite. The Raw Shea Butter Soap is scented with Frankinsense.  What a spiritual and relaxing experience in the shower. Not moisturizing and extremely strong scent that stays on through washes with an unscented soap. I actually like the smell, just can’t handle the intensity of it. Going back to Honey and Black Seed soap from this brand, which is top notch. I am extremely sensitive to soaps and face washes (so sensitive that I have to use hypoallergenic makeup), so I was looking for a more organic product that wouldn't cause me to break out in rashes, leave me with painfully dry skin, or cause me to break out. This is the perfect facial soap! It smells wonderful (without being artificially perfumed) and leaves my skin soft and clean. When I use my exfoliating clarifying lotion after washing my face, the cotton balls come away clean... a true testament to the power of cleanse. My skin is positively radiant since I've been using raw shea butter soap. My pores are smaller, my skin looks fresh and dewy, and it's the softest and clearest it has ever been. I think that it may have also helped to even out my skin tone a bit.I will never use another soap on my face now that I have found this product! If you have mostly problem free but dry, sensitive skin like me, try this soap! It cleans and moisturizes as well as (if not better than) expensive, high end department store soaps."
466,B000FDMREY,
467,B000I7S8XG,"This soap is the best for acne prone skin!  I have been using it for years now, and it has worked better than any other soap to help clear up and prevent breakouts. I am getting to an age where I need to moisturize quite a bit because this soap does dry my skin out, but I still choose it over anything else. I don’t use it consistently but it isn’t bad at all I couldn’t finish using it due to the fact that it has jasmine oil in it and I’m allergic to it, I wish they would come out with an unscented version. I remember when I first went to my dermatologist and they recommended I purchase Grandpas soap. I almost fell over and questioned their credibility, because we all know how soap is supposed to be so ""not clean."" But with my oily skin and larger pores, this soap is exactly what the Doctor ordered! I will never use another product again and it has changed my skin for the best. I am a lot less oily and I find my pores have shrunk in size. Also, um hello!? the price!?!? You cannot beat it for the results you get. I just read the directions (i mean who reads directions when it comes to using soap lol) and it says to leave it on your face for about a min. Trying to do that now, maybe the results will be even better! This soap works miracles. I'm 21 and have been using this soap for 4ish years now. I've seen huge improvements in the reduction of my acne first noticeable after just a week of using it. Don't waste your money on proactive - it never helped me, in fact, it seemed to make it worse. This soap did more in one week than proactive did in the 8 or so months i used proactive. Just use this soap every time you shower. Rinse your skin with warm water. Soap up. Let the soap sit for about 1 minute. Then rinse it off. Sometimes I use I have used this for 3 months now (morning and night, over night spot treatment). I originally bought it because of the reviews saying it helps perioral dermatitis— which I had a moderate case of. I used this with conjunction of teatree oil and Prosacea, and getting rid of my fluoride toothpaste— my perioral dermatitis is gone and went away within 2 weeks of starting that regimens, after having it for 6 months! The smell is not strong, it is not something others could smell on you, and it does have a regular “soapy” smell that masks the sulphur smell well. I have sensitive skin.  Products like benzoyl peroxide aggravate my acne problems and my dermatologist advised me to stay away from it.  I am also very fair skinned so every red spot shows immediately. I have had good luck with sulfur based products, so I tried this soap.  The soap does dry my skin out, but I have also found that any cleanser that has helped my acne usually does.  At first some spots on my face broke out a bit, but there had been some latent spots that probably needed to be ""pulled out"" so to speak.  In the past few days these spots have started to dry up and lose color.  I will alternate use of this bar with a gentle cleanser like Purpose, but I think it has helped my skin a great deal. The soap was nice it did not have a bad smell and it has fine grade grit to help scrub off your dead skin I’m not sure if it’s really helping with acne but mentally I like it."
468,B00006K14U,"....what you now use is bar soap. Both clean, this just cleans better. The scrubbing ingredients are particularly useful if your life style creates dirt or oil on your skin. The strength of agents to remove that in a regular bar of soap would damage the skin whereas the scrubbing elements present here do the same thing without causing harm to the skin. Just as easy to use in the shower as with a sink, it applies easily and rinses off just as easily. (I think it's better used in a shower but that's personal preference.) One thing to remember is that there is a certain amount of grit in this that can get in your eyes. It's easily washed out but if you're not expecting it, there may be another surprize. Also when using this, I'd take out any lenses so that the cleansing agents can't get under them.  (Another reason I prefer it in the shower, eyes can easily and quickly be cleaned.) Unlike some products whose efficacy is seen over time, this works the first time. Black heads are gone, skin smooths, pores open and all that in under a very few minutes. This isn't a mask to be left on, it's a replacement for soap. I use my hand to apply it and my finger tips to really get into the depressions around my nose and those cavities that develop as we age. And, by the way, using this adds flexibility that relaxes the furrows of age.This is a product specific made for men and addresses issues germane to men. What more can I say? Buy it. Try it. You won't be disappointed. I work in an urban environment with a 2-day break every five days which usually involves sun, outdoors and a totally different type of skin exposure [not that type of exposure, you filthy minded beasts].  As a result I tend to have dead skin buildup and oily patches in odd areas of my face. So after getting the shower started and cleaning and conditioning my hair, and the shower mirror fogs so I can no longer admire my chiseled physique, I bring out the face scrub and do a gentle once-over of my whole face and neck - yes, neck.  When you get nuzzled by supermodels every day, you want an exfoliated neck. I want that also. Anyway, this cleanser does a great job of the dead skin on my brows and forehead, nose, and oddly behind my ears while cleansing the over-oily parts. After rinsing my face feels clean with no oily or dead skin patches, but not dried-out like you get from soap, and not that stretched-out feeling from using more vicious face exfoliators. I find 3x a week works quite well. Unfortunately, I have really coarse thick hair on my face and have lately been suffering from black-heads on my forehead. Nothing too bad but I have noticed 4-5 a week that I did not used to get. I have only used this a few times, however, I am noticing results already. I used it in the shower the other day prior to shaving and can say that I have not had that close of a shave in a LONG TIME. I had been looking at switching over to a new shaving regimen thinking my Fusion and gel were not the right combo. Add this baby to the mix and I'm right as rain. Not sure how people have a hard time rinsing this off of their face...I work on my cars and bikes and have been able to get oil/grease/gas off my head no problem. Use it in the shower if it is that hard to do.I will report back if I start noticing any issues with the product. I've been using this product for about a week now, and so far, it's worked really well! I like that it leaves your face feeling clean and smooth, which is something that I haven't been able to find in any other products I've tried. As you use the product, the scrubbing beads do not dissolve, allowing for a  thorough exfoliation. While others may prefer using this product every other day or when shaving, I have been using it once daily in the shower and also before shaving. I haven't had any irritation or breakouts since using this product (keep in mind that I can sometimes break out even after using a product 2-3 times). I recommend this product for anyone looking for a pre-shave scrub AND deep cleanser, especially during these summer months! I wanted to balance out today's 1-star review of the face wash with a positive one for this scrub, because I am still using this product after 14 years. Nivea face wash and scrub products were excellent until the formulas of both were changed a few years back. Although the formula change (specifically the addition of menthol) ruined the face wash for me, this scrub did not suffer as badly. Although I do feel that the formula was similarly cheapened, I continue to use it because it works similarly to the original, and that was the best value scrub I've found. I'm also open to suggestions! With only a few reviews about this product, I wasn't sure I wanted to purchase it but I made the right choice.  You need very little applied to your face, and you don't need to scrub your face hard, or rub it into your skin too much.  It really does deep-clean and most guys like myself need something better than just using a bar of soap on the face which clogs the pores.  After I used the Nivea Face Scrub for the first time (this past week), I felt a slight burning sensation to my face after I left the shower.  However, there was no visual burning or redness on my face so I'm pretty confident it was just a result of the cleaning ingredients doing their job.  I plan on using this product 2-3 times a week as I think using it more would not serve the intended purpose. I bought this for my caveman husband, in hopes of bringing him into the wonderful world of men's skincare. He has sensitive skin, and has like Nivea products in the past. He uses this in the shower before shaving, and has said that it doesn't irritate his skin and makes it easier to shave. He also said it smells nice and it ""wakes his face up"" in the morning. He says he likes the grittiness to it...that it makes his face feel clean. If he's happy with it, I'm happy with it. Will continue to sneak more Nivea mens skincare products into his daily routine ;)"
469,B000ICR9UO,"I waited awhile to review this soap, making sure to allow some time for any reactions that might crop up. I've been undergoing a systemic campaign to reduce my facial redness (in response to high stress or irritating products I can erupt in pimple like bumps and red patches.)In my obsessive campaign to reduce the redness, I came to the conclusion from my research that it was probably a reaction to mites (that are everywhere, on everyone's skins, they always will be), or rather the 'end products' of the mites! When one's immune system is under stress, from emotions or illness etc, the reaction to the mites, or possibly their populations themselves, increase. These tiny creatures have been implicated in MANY serious skin conditions, (Rosacea, psoriasis, exczema, etc) and in some animals also. (A well reputed dermatologist told me that a small percentage of the population - often with Celtic genes but not exclusively - lacks the enzyme that breaks down mite waste products - thus the reactivity that can take many unsightly forms!). They can even be responsible for a certain sweet musky odor that can show up in bedrooms where the bedding is not washed frequently. I know that is all pretty gross to realize, and makes one squeamish.  But it's nothing personal, just nature, in its complex glory.These little hitchhikers apparently hide out in our hair follicle areas (and sometimes in the eyebrows and eyelashes) and come out at night to 'feed' in areas on the face!  Once I found this out I really got freaked out and started looking at myself with magnifying glasses etc at night, because apparently sometimes they can be seen 'emerging'! Never saw anything like that thank goodness.Now the thing is they can't be totally eliminated - but at least reduced in numbers. Science may one day prove they are 'helping' us somehow, in a symbiotic fashion. In the meantime, we who are sensitive, must try to reduce them at least.This soap has sea buckthorn and other ingredients which have been shown to reduce the mites.So I began laundering my pillowcases more often, using Borax (which helps kill off mites) in the laundry, and even spraying around the bed area with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and Borax. The one measure I've taken that really helped (besides this soap) has been using mite proof allergy dust covers on the pillows, under the pillowcase, and changing the pillowcase daily. In two weeks I've seen a HUGE improvement in my skin doing this.My skin is fair tending to ruddiness, reactive.  I typically use a gentle cleanser to melt the makeup first if I'm wearing any (Armani Mineral melt is my latest, previously used Burt's Bees Cleanser for sensitive skin, I liked that too), then I've followed with this soap - but I found it too drying to use daily so now more like every other day.The soap doesn't have much lather, and not much scent, but what there is is mild. I notice an immediate reduction of redness after using it. Again, its a little drying but would be perfect if you are oily. My own skin is in the 'normal' range especially in the T-zone.A good product and recommended. Good luck in your search for clear skin and especially in the fight with the old 'epidermal hitchhikers'. Does to do what it promises? Yes and no. Yes it does kill the demodex mite and improve skins appearance. But it is too drying for me. You have to leave it on for at least 1-3 minutes as directed on box. That is a long time. Not quite sure why you must let it sit. I can't use it myself it's to drying for my skin. It smells lovely. I was able to see improvements in redness and bumps but I abandoned it because it was too much effort for me to use daily theme have to slather on lotion to counteract the drying effect. It did and does stop my skin itching very well. I use it on an as needed basis. AFTER SUFFERING FOR YEARS WITH AND MISDIAGNOSED/UNDIAGNOSED FACIAL SKIN DISORDER DERMATITIS ETC I WAS TIRED OF MY SKIN NOT EXFOLIATING LIKE NORMAL PPL LAYERS OF DRY DEAD SKIN NOT NATURALLY RELEASING ITS BOND WITH THE UNDER LYING SKIN THIS SOAP HELPS TREMENDOUSLY IT IS NOT A CURE BECAUSE IF I SKIP A DAY IT WILL COME RIGHT BACK BUT IT DOES WAY MORE THAN ANY PRESCRIBED MEDS EVR DID MY SKIN IS CLEAR MY OLAY REGENERATING CREAM CAN BE PUT ON MY ACTUAL SKIN NOT dead unsloughed skin sorry for capital letters didn't realize type too slow to do over I'm a hairy, rashy person who has a lot of minor allergies. When I read about the mites, I was intrigued. I thought it could be possible that I was having an allergic reaction to the mites' saliva or other excretions, so I had to try this soap.I like to give any new product a month or more before I judge it, and here's what I think:This is the best thing for my skin I've ever found and I consider myself a veteran in the acne war.I'm 40 and I've had acne since I was 12. I used tetracycline and accutane as a teenager.  I've used benzoyl peroxide for over 20 years and had a brief stint with retin A.This is the only thing that has made my skin better. the hundreds of rashy forehead bumps are gone.This in itself is miraculous, but the rest of my face has also cleared up.I still get the occasional zit or two but now I can even leave the house without cover up on my face. I'm fine with one or two pimples compared to the red, active 40 I had before.Also, the bar lasts a long time. I still have more than half the bar left after 6 weeks of washing 1-2 times a day. I love this soap and have been using it for years to help calm my Rosacea.  I wouldn't use anything else! This is the first review I have written but I felt I needed to do so because this product is so good. I have had Rosacea for years with both breakouts and redness. This soap is the only product that has cleared up my Rosacea and that includes using prescription medication.After the first couple of days it helped to clear up my breakouts and then I did have a flare up for about a week or so. After sticking with the morning and evening washing regimen for about 3 weeks, I saw a clear improvement.I have been using this soap for about 8 weeks and it has cleared my face of all breakouts and redness. Now that my Rosacea is under control, I have stopped using my prescription medications to treat it saving me a lot of money.If you have Rosacea, try this soap and stick with it for at least a month to see the full affects. I couldn't be happier with this product."
470,B0010BBCFK,"I am almost 30. Not much wrinkles yet. But I do have some, some blotchy areas, large pores, dry and sensitive skin. No acne. When I use this product I see a difference in my skin. I live in a very dry climate in Northern California at a high altitude. I also have hard water. Ever since I moved here I have been battling dry skin. I was given a demo of this product at the mall. I am so glad I did not fork over $175 at that time. I found this on Amazon and was thrilled to pay a reasonable price. I see people complaining about the oily residue. A lot of people don't like thAt aspect of it. But contrary to evey face wash commercial you have ever seen: oil is GOOD for your skin. We all have natural oils that are being stripped from our skin when we wash it or expose it to the elements. A good way to use this product is before bed time. You are not meant to wash off the oils. So do this at bedtime and let it absorb overnight. I go this and in the morning all I do is rinse with cool water as to not remove the oils. When I sleep with it on, I feel it gives the oils time to absorb. I wake up with smaller pores, plump skin, and even skin tone. Maybe the magnet is a bit of a gimmick, but I can't argue with results. Do the mask evey 1-2 weeks. People compliment my skin on a daily basis (but I suppose a good portion of that is just plain genetics).  I also moisturize with 100% organic virgin coconut oil at least every other day. UPDATE: I no longer use the Premiere Dead Sea line. I still think it is a great line. Unfortunately, I have bought several items from Amazon with the correct packaging, but it does not match the product from the cart (different smells, colors, consistencies and results in the creams and serums). I am not going to pay 300 bucks for a single bottle or 30 for the wrong stuff.I have always had large pores, so I began to use the Dead Sea Premiere Biox Line. I was amazed at the results- my pores visibly shrank. However, they were still noticeable. I remembered a sales agent trying to sell me this mask for a $300 price. She said it would help my reduce my pores as well - as long as I wasn't broken out. At the time, I wasn't able to afford that price tag. Eventually, I found it on Amazon for less than $30 bucks! It is amazing!First you apply this iron enriched mask on your face. I like to apply it fairly heavily. Let it sit for about ten minutes. During this time the dirt is suppose to attach or get stuck in the iron mask. Then you use a magnet to remove both the iron and dirt. Immediately after, I notice that my pores aren't as clogged - but they don't look smaller. This is because it takes time for the pores to shrink. As I go throughout my day, I notice my skin looking healthier and cleaner.On a side note, these Dead Sea Premiere Products make my skin glow. I have told people that I wasn't wearing any make-up, and people are shocked. I strongly recommend several of their product line. Me super agrado I had purchased this in the mall and paid....a lot more...than on Amazon.  I was glad to learn on Amazon about the ""bargaining ability"" with the mall people and also that the best place to purchase it was Amazon.  I had bought one at the mall (got two free products) and I bought two more on Amazon.  My son has psoriasis.  He same over one day with a bad outbreak and we used it on his leg.  He called the next day to ask where I got it as it had cleared up the outbreak. His father has it and uses a lot of prescription and expensive over the counter products to control it. My son had tried numerous over the counter as he has no insurance and nothing worked until he used this. I knew he wouldn't pay what I did at the mall so I bought them on Amazon.  I love it and my daughter as well on the face.  It leaves your face smooth, without blotches and moisturized. It really does make your skin radiant and it smells wonderful too.  I actually haven't received my Amazon purchased ones as they are shipped from Israel but the reviews were good so I assume they will be as good as the mall product and a LOT less expensive.

Couldn't afford the $300 price tag though.  So happened to be on Amazon and found this.  The mask came well packaged in the original packaging/box.  Premier safety seal was intact and the product was well within the ""use by date"".  I believe this is authentic because I used it today and got the same results as the one in the mall for $300 and all safety seals were intact which leads me to believe it was not tampered with.  At this price I can use this every week if I would like too.  Would buy this product again and from this seller also."
471,B000GCICTS,"Use for moisturizing and cleansing. I have an allergy to almost everything I use on my skin! This aloe is the best one. I use it for everything. Works great on my hair, to tame frizzy's around face, sunburns, dry skin (eczema patches). The only brand that I like. This is the exact aloe gel I've been using. Unscented is great because of my allergies to manufactured fragrances.Some people complain of the ingredient ""urea"" probably thinking of something different. This ""urea"" is common to a lot of moisturizers and is is manufactured and does not come from animals. (Note: I purchased the crystal clear regular gel, NOT the Clear Blue.  This is pure gel without lidocaine or menthol.)  I've been buying this aloe vera for 25+ years.  It's one of those items that's essential.  The last bottle lasted for four+ years.  I first purchased it when I moved to the desert many years ago.  I used it for vaginal dryness, as well as for dry itchy skin and burns.  For me, it stops itching immediately.  Nothing soothes like this this product. I've also used it for caregiving- after bathing, for minor skin irritations.  It's non-toxic, safe for sensitive skin, for sensitive areas.  There are MANY uses- for pets, for using as a conductive substance for TENS units.  I buy 99% DMSO gel (which assures delivery of substances- e.g., medication, nutrients, etc, thru the skin- organs for transplant are packed in it, miraculous stuff, but undiluted it burns) and cut it 25-50% with aloe vera gel, for use with my facial TENS unit along with skin nutrients, like hyaluronic acid- instant facelift.  DMSO also deadens pain, and I've used it along with aloe vera gel with pets and other animals, for example (in small amounts).  I found a injured mockingbird whose leg was broken, it turned black- I applied a 50-50 mixture (not too much for such a small creature), and amputated the leg- she appeared to be in no pain whatsoever and recovered fully.  I've also used this mixture with colloidal silver added for wounds large and small, hastens healing, works miracles.  I wouldn't be without this stuff, it's the BEST. Good moisturizer for your face. I also use it for my wash and go style. This stuff keeps me alive. Warning though, the top on this one sucks. I swapped it out for my older bottle that had a locking top (the one that you don't have to pump it all the way down (wasting product) to lock it). This product came with a broken pump and you can't return it through Amazon. The product came busted and leaking. The aloevera is good but the packaging and container is bad. Don't recommend. It's pretty good for what you pay for.  I'd keep buying it, although it's not 100% aloe.  There's a bit of water added as well as a few other ingredients including vitamin E Acetate (and the other few are probably to preserve it) There's not much scent to it, and it coats and stays on the skin for a while. It keeps me moisturized."
472,B00117F5PG," This is a wonderful product.  Over a period of about three months, it has smoothed out a lot of wrinkled areas and prevented new wrinkles from cropping up.  It was by chance that a  sales rep at the mall gave me a couple samples from the Premier Dead Sea kiosk.  I always love free things, so I gave it a try.  It felt so wonderful, and  have now been using it ever since that time.  I recently went to a party with 10 of my friends who are either around my age or younger, and my complexion looks vastly smoother and younger than theirs.  After washing my face at night ( frequently exfoliate to open pores and remove dead cells) I apply a small amount over all areas of my skin except my nose.  It feels so smooth afterwards and the absorption is lovely .  It's not greasy and doesn't sit on top of the skin like other oils.  I have used products that will leave residue on the skin which actually seems to exacerbate the wrinkles.  Not so with this serum.  Because I live in a very dry area and spend time in the sun, I use the serum in the morning as well.  I couldn't be happier, and it took a lot of errors buying other products to find this one.  The benefits of this truly outweigh its cost;  I highly recommend it and wish I had started using it sooner.  The product is about four times more expensive at the mall, so this is a great value. Use in everyday facial routine I AM LOOKINF FOR THE BOTO TARGET WRINKEL FILLER. Value for money I don't use anything but Dead Sea Premier products on my skin!!You know the products are working when your 16 year old son notices and tells you that your complexion is smooth, flawless and glowing and your friends insist you've had fillers.  I am 50 years old and most people I meet think I'm 40 and are stunned to learn my age!Since I started using Dead Sea Premier products almost 2 years ago I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin.I absolutely love their serums, cream facial products cause my skin to break out, since starting their product line I no longer have breakouts.I recently started using the Dead Sea Premier Concentrated Facial Serum with Vitamin E & C and I love how silky my face feels. I didn't think it would be possible for my skin to look any better but since I started using this serum my pores have minimized even more.I have tried many, many product lines over the years in all price ranges and some that you can only purchase through a physician and NONE of them perform like Dead Sea Premiers products do.  I do not work for them or any companies associated with them or who sell their products and I don't know anyone who does, this is my testimonial and it is not influenced by anyone. I read the data about using a dermaroller to help with skin care. Also known as ""microneedle skin care."" The dermaroller company suggest an intense serum with Vitamin E and C to be used after microneedling. The needle system allows more product to absorbed into the skin, therefore you will see better results. They also say not to use anything that is not in a pump as it will become unstabalized. This fit the bill. While using the derma roller I use EMU oil to keep infection down, and then wash my face with antibacterial soap. You only have about 10 min to get the concentrated facial serum on your face before your face pores begin to close up. So after I wash with antibacterial soap, I run the derma roller over my face again, and put on the serum. The lines around my eyes have literally disappeared. The lines around the top of my lips are diminished by 50% and the deep lines are now barely noticable. I am a 54, white female, with oily skin on my forhead and dry skin on my cheeks and eyes. I am going to order another bottle. Everythi v perfect..Great Seller"
473,B00142C8KS,"Love this eye cream! Has zero scent, which I love, and I do notice a little difference after applying this. It's a thicker cream but you can wear it all over the face without feeling greasy or heavy. I don't feel like it really works well for dark circles, however, I feel like it is a good preventative for wrinkles and keeps the eye area hydrated. Respetuosamente les manifiesto q realice el pedido de 3 productos , y solo me llego uno ... y me cobraron 2 ??..Necesito me envíen todo el pedido completo ... Recomendado I'm 26 years old and have huge, deep set eyes and the skin underneath is very thin which makes me look tired all the time. I don't wear a lot of make-up so I'm glad to find a product that isn't just a cover up; it actually helps reduce the look of puffiness and dark circles. This product works well so long as you use it in the morning and at night before going to bed. It's non greasy and does NOT have an ""old lady"" smell. sorry - I am in a hurry I’ve tried a few eye creams but this is the one I always go back to. It has never irritated my eyes, which is quite important to me. There’s no fragrance, and I like that because who really needs their eyes to smell good?  I do think it has helped diminish my crows feet, and I definitely haven’t added any! I’m over 40. I love thick, creamy eye creams that make me feel like its working.  This product doesn't do it for me.  I suppose I should have known because of the price however, I wanted to give it a chance and wanted to love it, but I cannot recommend.  Also, it does sting my eyes a little but not that much.  I would not purchase again.  On to the next eye cream search! I haven't been using this product for long, and later will come back and comment on its anti-aging properties.  But for now, I gotta say I LOVE this cream.  I just started using it in conjunction with the Himalaya Undereye Cream.  I use the Himalaya and the Home Health Goji Berry in the morning before I apply make-up, and I love the combo. I use the Home Health alone at night.  It applies so easily and is quickly absorbed.  The scent is pleasant and not over-bearing at all.  It's like a drink of water for the skin around my eyes.  I usually suffer from dryness on my eyelids, but I haven't had any issues with that since I started using the Goji Berry cream.  I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out.  My eyes have already thanked me!I'll update my review at a later time to comment on the anti-aging effects!"
474,B001F51TVI,"Firstly this same 3 pack costs only $9.88 when you buy it from Sam's club so at this price you're being ripped off.This is simply the best body wash I've ever used.- container is designed very well so you can get all your body was out- Body wash does a great job without leaving your skin feeling dry and itchy.- It has a subtle, very pleasant aroma for a man or woman.I'll certainly buy this again, but not from Amazon as it's much cheaper elsewhere. I do like this body wash... but not as much as my husband does.  It's the ONLY thing he will use.  His skin gets a little dry especially in winter months and he says Olay Ultra with Shea Butter is the ONLY one for him... I prefer more ""natural"" products and things that smell most musky.One thing to note about this body wash is that it's so moisturizing that the stuff doesn't rinse out of washcloths well.  It actually has changed the texture of every washcloth he uses... Hmmm. Olay advanced healing lotion AND Olay's ultra moisture body wash w/shea butter has got to have a part in showing me signs of healing my problematic dry skin areas. This regimen started in March also leaving the Dove soap bar. Olay's body wash actually c-l-e-a-n-s your skin. When I started this body wash, my shower suds were dusty but No More. Maybe that's why my dry skin areas are waking up, no longer ?clogged?  That dermatologist never queried how I washed my body!?! On-line viewings prompted my departure from soap bars. Definitely move away from soap bars! Take my word for it, I have dry skin areas that are showing signs of workable life. I knew I was wasting money with that dermatologist. I love being able to purchase the name brand of this soap on Amazon at such a great price, and have it delivered on a set schedule so we never run out.It is soothing, with a light scent that does not compete with other products.  It's creamy, and only a little is needed so it lasts a good time - certainly longer than the generics I've used from Target, etc.  It works well for shaving as much as for cleansing.  No sticky or oily residue.  We use this for adults & children without any problems. Love this brand and was glad to find a bargain bulk purchase. That said, the water is so hard here in my phoenix bedroom community the shea butter sort of sticks to you a bit. It's not too bad, I just use less and make sure to use a sqwishy sponge. I cannot say anything bad about something that smells so good; I am a sucker for things that smell good (lotion, shampoo, conditioner, washing powders, etc); this item was at a resort I stayed at while on vacation, and loved the smell so much that I determined to buy it.  Amazon had the better deal, so I got the 3-package deal.  It glides on smoothly and doesn't take a lot; yep, I'm hooked..... Love this body wash. I suffered for years with dry skin (especially during winter season). Using this product every day, I no longer have itchy dry skin any more. Have been using this for years now and won't change brands. While other products claim to be moisturizing, nothing comes close to this. As a man using this product, I was worried the fragrance would be more for a woman, but it is not, it is a simple clean, fresh scent. The Shea Butter in this makes your skin soooooo soft I love it!  You don't feel dried out several hours after you have gotten out of the shower.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fragrance. It has a strong flowery smell and I prefer a refreshing citrus or classic clean smell.  I with they had more fragrance options to choose from."
475,B0009F3NGE,"Best tanner ever! Great Best self tanning product out there.streak free beautiful color.I get so many compliments on my summer tan. It doesn't streak Nice stuff!  I read a lot of reviews of self-tanners, and chose this one because it sounded like the best, and is very affordable.  it really IS easy to use.  I seem to have a knack for applying it, or else it's just really easy.  I am NOT an experienced self-tanner.  So, I followed some advice about applying moisturizer first, just to the areas you DON'T want to take up the tanner as much (like elbows, knees, ankles and dry skin over the achilles tendon) and then, go for it!  It spreads easily, and dries quickly, and I don't mind the odor at all.  My skin took it up quickly, as far as the tan goes.  The very next day I thought I looked like I'd been out in the sun.  It looks very natural, and I don't notice lines where I stopped applying the stuff.  For example, I like to put it on my neck, shoulders, upper arms, and chest.  It doesn't look like there's an obvious line where I didn't apply it to my forearms.The first time I applied it to everything (well, like hands, wrists, feet and toes) I did notice extra tan between fingers and toes, and I think it's nearly impossible to apply the stuff to the hands, and then somehow use soap and water to get it OFF your hands, and still end up with natural looking tan on your hands.  Good luck with that.  The best I did was to finish up applying around my wrists, and then, after I was all done, including washing with soap, I rubbed the backs of my hands over my thighs in order to get a little self-tanner there.  That was good, but now that the sun is out and my hands have a little more color, I don't bother with the self tanner there anymore.Have fun!  This is a really nice, easy to use product.  Looks GOOD.  Very natural.  I look good, and my husband hasn't noticed I've been getting a tan.  I think that's good.  He notices artificial things (like a little make-up). This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE self-tanner out there!!! And I have tried MANY!!  I used to be a ""Sun Goddess"", owned a Tanning Salon, and even had a tanning bed in my home. Until I was diagnosed with skin cancer. Now I avoid the sun like the plague, but I am so excited that I found a product that is as close to the REAL THING as this is!! It is almost too good to be true. It sounds like I am getting paid to write this review but, trust me, I am not. I love that it's a gel, it doesn't streak, it doesn't smell, it develops slowly-as a tan from the sun would, and it does not smell bad! The only issue is that lately I've been having trouble finding it. I will be HEARTBROKEN if L'oreal decides to discontinue this. Maybe I shouldn't have written such a good review! I better start hoarding and stock up!!! Hands down the BEST self-tanner I've tried in my entire life. And trust me, I quit tanning beds a longgggg time ago & have tried dozens of different brands. This stuff is gel...so it's very smooth going on & is easy to even out. It's a small looking bottle; but unlike lotion that can get chunky while trying to spread it out (and therefore using twice as much product), I drip a quarter size drop in my hands & that alone will cover an entire limb. The scent is a very mild ""clean"" smell, that doesn't linger for long after applying. I am a blonde-haired, blue eyed chick with very fair skin. I think the bottle says ""for medium-dark"" skin tones, but after one use, I had a great sun-kissed color within hours. I reaply to my entire body 2-3 times a week and I maintain a gorgeous color of bronze. The gel also dries very quickly and does not streak whatsoever. Sweating or other activities involving water wont cause it to drip off your skin. Great price & I will probably be ordering this stuff continuously for my entire life. VERY HAPPY!!PS- Be careful when pouring it into your hands. You don't need to squeeze the bottle...the gel will just slide out by itself. :) L'Oreal.. My 2 x cents..  This is my favorite tanning product.  Man, during Seattle winters I look so white its' horrible.  Since I'm from Hawaii something has to be done. So, this tanning lotion does work very well.  Best by far that I've tried & I've tried them all..  Put it on the face evenly and avoid touching light color hair.  For example my beard is grey & if i get it on my beard it turns orange.  Also, white t shirts neck area will turn orange.  If you leave it on your face it will get tanner on day 2... Does use a lot, just takes a little bit of product, its more important to use it evenly.. The result looks very nice & it's easy to use, cheap, doesn't cause achne, doesn't sting the eye area.  When done applying it, make sure you wash your hands really well with warm water and soap."
476,B001441QE0,"I have extremely dry skin due to an illness and a nurse recommended a drugstore body lotion that's full of preservatives and chemicals, and it worked, but I'm not spreading that stuff on my skin. None of my mostly natural lotions were cutting it, but this one absolutely does. It's rich and creamy, absorbs quickly, and keeps my skin soft for more than a day. It is the best I have ever tried. I can always add a drop of essential oil or my favorite scent to it if I feel like it, which I love. Truly one of the best body lotions I've ever used. I have been using this product for a long time now, and keep coming back to it.  It has a mildly fragrant scent (which I love!), and it sinks into my skin quickly, without leaving any visible white film or greasy layer.  According to my trusty app that shows ""dirty"" ingredients , this lotion comes near perfectly clean.  I would highly recommend, and will continue to love this lotion. This product was recommended to me by a friend who also went through chemo. I have used it for 2 years and it works the best- no scent, no irritation, goes on smooth, absorbs quickly.  My skin changed so much , have been extremely happy with it. Sa much as I liked my previous moisturizer, the chemicals were irritating me in treatment.My only problem was the pump just wouldn’t pop up this last time, so luckily I had my old pump and just switched- I use every last drop- even cutting it open towards the end :) I love this lotion, and have been using it for years. Product quality is still excellent. Packaging is not excellent. The past 3 bottles I purchased have had pump dispensers that do not unscrew to pop the plunger up into position for use, or just do not work. Again, the pump doesn’t work properly on this bottle I received.Disappointed and frustrated. I've loved this lotion for a long time but the new yellow bottle is so hideous I cannot have it out in my house or buy this product again, so disappointing I bought this for one of my daughters as part of her Christmas gifts.  She has very delicate and sensitive skin.  This is the best moisturizer for her.  There's no scent and it soaks in quickly. If your looking for a good lotion that softens your skin and keeps it soft!  You'll love this one!! Amazing moisturizing!!! Kept my skin amazing the whole brutal winter!"
477,B000MAQWA0,"My sister purchased this product for me years ago. So happy  I  found it again. Serum really is good for your  skin Works well, once a week,  quick 1 min peel. I used this for a year.  It had a tingling at first but as your skin gets used to it, that goes away.  It still made my skin feel a little tight.  The smell is not great but that is the nature of vitamin C and all products smell similar.  It has always arrived a little brownish, never clear.  Not sure if it That meant it was oxidized, but it did seem to work. I  stopped my subscription when I received it and the top was a little loose.  It didn’t fee the same so I think it had oxidized.  It is not worth it to me to buy a product that the company doesn’t invest in by putting a little money into a wrap of some kind to ensure it doesn’t come loose or leak.  It is too expensive to throw away!  I switched to Timeless which is 20% and is clear in color.  It arrived with good packaging, has an air pump to keep air tight, vitamin e, the good kind of vitamin c, and best of all, is half of the price.  It was recommended by Angie from hot & flashy. I also now keep it in the fridge to preserve it as long as possible.  Mychelle needs to invest in better packaging. I've suffered with acne for around 8 years and finally managed to clear up recently thanks to antibiotics and prescription retinol. I've tried other very expensive serums (Lancome, etc) and other vitamin C serums from various brands. I didn't see much of a difference on my skin at all; I thought vitamin C just wasn't for me. I have scarring and uneven skin. I decided to try a sample of MyChelle's 17% serum from the store I work at and I saw my skin overall look better in about 5 days. Less redness and oilyness. I decided to then buy the 25%.My skin is luminous and looks healthier now. I've only been using it a month! I've been getting compliments on my skin as opposed to before. Feels good to find a product that actually does what it claims. It has also been helping my dark circles under my eyes a bit but I don't put too much in that area because it's sensitive.I was using it twice a day but you shouldn't mix retinol and vitamin C because they contradict each other. It caused me to get a few breakouts. I only use this after my day routine now. Retinol at night. My skin is better now and radiant. I store this in the fridge along with my retinol.Like others have mentioned, the pump isn't great. I deducted a star due to this. Vitamin C is very frail, hence why I store in the fridge. I'm wondering if they could perhaps get a better dispenser while keeping the product effective. The pump gets hard sometimes but I've managed to get the appropriate dose so far.I definitely recommend giving this a shot if you can afford it and deal with redness, extra oil, and dull skin. I've never been happier with my skin and it's improving every week now. I use the Perfect C Serum along with other MyChelle skincare products. At first I wasn't sure that I would continue with it, but I quickly noticed a difference after I stopped using the C Serum. I easily go through one bottle a month (if I'm lucky!) so, at $30 a pop, it's just as expensive as the high end C-serum lines. Still, I love the non-toxic MyChelle products and have found that they're as effective as they claim to be. And even though I'm now putting more serums and lotions on my face than ever before, my skin is not breaking out which was an unexpected, and welcome, bonus. Another bonus is that the MyChelle line smells great, not perfumey,  but honest-to-goodness yummy.The one negative, in my opinion, is the C Serum packaging. It would be nice if they sold a larger size with a better dispensing mechanism. The calibrated pump doesn't always dispense a full application and it stops working before the bottle is empty. I've taken to undoing and replacing the cap which seems to help as the bottle gets low. Towards the end, I just shake out as much of the remnants as I can. This stuff isn't cheap so I try to get every last bit of it!Best deals: So far, I've found that Amazon is the best place to buy MyChelle. Their prices are consistently lower than average. You can also get deals on eBay, but you have to work (snipe) for them. MyChelle does not supply expiration dates (they are supposed to be good for 18 to 24 months from purchase), so I prefer to buy from a reputable source. The MyChelle website does have a really good sale every now and then so, if you like her products, you may want to get on the email list.About me: I am a 48-year old grandmother of three and in the past three months, since I began using the MyChelle line, I've been carded twice and have received numerous compliments about my ""glowing"" complexion. I followed the suggestions on the MyChelle website and I'm using the My aesthetician recommended this to help fade my malasma and it WORKS! Nothing else that I've tried works but the components in this cream do work. The scent is what I'd call brown sugar and I don't like it but it fades quickly. I still use my moisturizer on top."
478,B001DXOWA2,"Do not buy this product at the mall because as other reviewers have mentioned it has a huge markup there.Now, I have been using this product for around four weeks and I can honestly say that it performs the same as some creams that cost upward of $250 dollars. There is a small thing you have to remember when using this cream and that is that you have to keep using it to retain the results! I have been guilty of discontinuing use for a day or two because I was ""just too tired"" to go through with my normal regimen and I noticed the difference immediately. While using the Ageless future cream I noticed an immediate softening and fullness in the one present small lines I have on my 34 yr old face. My husband also noticed the positive difference in my skin immediately.The one thing that keeps me from writing a five star review is the fact that this product contains UREA! Yes, I know most cosmetics use the synthetic form of UREA. However that knowledge doesn't keep me from being a little queasy that I'm putting the synthetic properties of urine on my face. Also most cosmetic research agencies indicate that UREA can cause inflammation. So if you are sensitive you may want to try this at the mall without buying to find out if you will be sensitive.Overall I like it and it makes my skin feel great! I have been using this cream for at least 8 years or more and I just love it.  I get more compliments about how I never look my age - I am 62 and most people think I am in my 40'2.  I also teach school so I am home all summer and I am at the beach and in the sun 24/7.  I am also in the sun during my vacations.  I use this cream before I put on my make-up and before I go to bed.  You only need a little because it spreads and covers very well. Great Product - all Premier products are great and I swear by them and Amazon has great prices and ships right away!!!! This one fits any age and any type of skin. I am only 19 yrs but it makes me feel my skin smooth, soft and moisture, even in the dry Pennsylvania. The reason I did not give five star is I do not really like the smell. I think the it has natural smell and no more any additional fragrance added. But somehow I prefer the flower secent. I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  I have side by side the ones I purchased from the mall and the ones I purchased from Amazon.  They are identical.  One difference is the ones from Amazon at 70-90% discount from the mall.  What not to love about the products.  Ladies with mature skin, try them.  Cream works well with serum.  Your skin will thank you. I have just started using this product so suffice it to say, it's not a miracle cream and I don't see ""results"" yet, but I do love the way my face feels after I use it.  It feels smooth to the touch and looks softer - for that reason alone, I give it 5 stars. I have used a few other Premium products but I really like this one.  My skin feels so soft after applying it and I do feel that my skin has improved some. I have used this product for the past year and while results are good, I find the skin on my forehead showing more fine lines. Haven't found another product that works as well Actually.. we are just using it for 3 days and no skin irritation occurs so its good so far I will write a proper review once i see a real result on my skin."
479,B0001EL5R2,"I’ve tried many acne creams and this has to the worst bang for your buck hands down. Expensive as hell with zero results. I try rubbing it in completely- not helpful. I try leaving a glob on my incoming zit- not helpful. This feels and acts like nothing more than a super expensive moisturizing lotion. This product line was recommended to me via a medi-spa when I had an IPL facial. As a 38 year old female with combination acne prone sensitive skin, I was scared to try a product I thought might either make me break out or react negatively. I had tried other products in the past from the drug store (Neutrogena) or beauty counter (Clinique), or online (Paula Begoun) all with mixed mediocre results.The price was a little steep, but the three week trial kit this came in let me test drive it. I used each product in the trial kit as directed. After the three weeks had passed, my skin was clearing and managing the retinol very well! The brightness, tone and texture of my skin improved daily with very visible results! I decided to invest in all the full size versions of the products in the kit, and though it was pricey, it was completely worthwhile.After two months of use, my skin is possibly the best it has ever been.  I have very minimal to no breakouts. I don't have to wear much makeup at all beyond a little foundation or concealer to even out my color.  Lines by my eyes and mouth are reduced. Redness is gone.  Old acne scars and discolorations are fading. the texture is GREAT.  I have gotten compliments on my skin lately. (You look healthy / are glowing! / look so young! You can't be 38!) I almost wish I had taken before and after photos. I cant believe it, but I actually threw out all the other non-PCA skin care products in my cabinet without hesitation.Anyway, PCA Skin is an awesome line.  It does not disappoint. It is gentle yet effective. No greasiness or icky perfumes.You get what you pay for with PCA Skin. I have been battling acne for about 6-7 years now. I am a 23 year old guy and still have weekly ance. I have never had really bad acne, but I do get deep cystic acne every once in a while and several weekly pimples. I started a new regiment 2 weeks (Listed Below) ago and by the looks of it I finally have clear skin with no signs of new pimples or cysts emerging.I have to say that this cream is powerful stuff and should only be used as a spot treatment. I dab a little, right ontop of an emerging pimple at night and by morning the size is reduced significantely. 2-3 days later its gone.Took me years to find the right products for me - I have very sensitive skinMy Skin Regiment ~Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (AM/PM)Yes To Daily Balancing Moisturizer, Tomatoes (AM/PM)PCA Skin pHaze 33 Acne Cream (PM only)Zinc for Acne - pills (AM only)Fish Oil - pills (AM only)Other Things to Consider when trying to achieve great skin - Probably the most important too64 - 128 oz of Water Daily6 - 8 Hrs of Sleep a Night1 Hr of Exercise per day (5 per/week)It all adds up to great skin in the end... Hope this helps! I'm in my mid forties and dealing with acne that's worse than any time during my teens.  I found this product at my plastic surgeon's office when I was in for a per-cancerous mole removal but kept whining about my middle age acne issues.  This isn't magic but it really has worked wonders for me.  I can use other products with so-so results but as soon as I return to pHaze 33 my face clears up.  I can use most soaps with little impact - it's this cream that is making the difference.My (step) grandkids have discovered this in my medicine cabinet and as they grow through their late teens, they've all tried it and LOVE it.  I should probably include this in with their stocking stuffers from now on...To use: at bedtime, wash with a good cleanser (I'm just using Noxzema these days) rinse with warm water and pat your skin with a dry or damp cloth to remove most of the rinse water.  Apply pHaze 33 to areas where acne is showing, or you can feel it coming.  Don't use as a preventative, if it's not their don't bother treating that area. I have been dealing with acne for about 7 years. I have tried everything, tons of over the counter prescriptions, Acnefree, been to my doctor for antibiotics, birth control, been to a dermatologist, done microdermabrasion, used natural oils, honey, face masks, etc.. okay so basically almost everything. I have never heard of PCA Skin until I came across the amazing reviews on Amazon.. and now I see why people love this product. I have had a million little pimples on my forehead for a long time and I have used this product for only 2 days, along with PCA clearskin. This morning I woke up with half as many pimples and I am seriously amazed. This was a little expensive for just a little thing of it, but I only use it as a spot treatment so I think it will last me awhile. Anyways, I recommend this product to anyone dealing with acne! I know everyones skin is different but I would give it a try if you are searching to tackle your acne. I hope this product continues to work for me because I am so happy with the results so far. My face has lately been breaking out worse than ever, and I knew I needed to try something else besides my daily face wash. I ended up buying this and giving it a chance. Surprisingly, it's healing all of my acne.Little bumps aren't really going away, but the few that were close to or were white heads are gone. On top of that, one scab is healing quicker than it should've. This is definitely helping and I'll keep using it.But just be aware of something - .5oz is a darn small jar. It came in a huge box for the size (about 6 inches by 8 by 4) and in another box that was the packaging for the actual jar. The jar itself is barely an inch tall. Don't be surprised. It works well for the money but it was definitely a shocker."
480,B0009RFAPY,"I’m 86 years old and was in my forty’s before I used moisturizer because I had sensitive skin and didn’t react well to most products. The product I used was discontinued and was I searching for some thing new when a dermatologist listed this as one of the products he recommended.  I have used it for almost 30 years and continually get complements on how well I look and my skin. Now I know I’m getting old looking but my skin is certainly good for my age and it is comfortable.  Not dry or scalely. My favorite facial cleanser, but great for other body areas where skin is sensitive. I’ve been using this product for years and love it. I was breaking out with pimples because my face was so dry after moving to a super dry state, Texas.  This product helped my face because it did not dry out my skin and was super soft so I could was 2 times a day without my face breaking out.  Love this product because it cleans really well but does not strip your face and very gentle on your skin (as an acne product that's pretty awesome). Purpose soap a great gentle face soap. Great product. I have eczema and most face wash dries out my face, this removes my make up and gently washes off any dirt of grease. This is what cleared mt acne along with eating ect but this helped so much!! These bottles are very tiny for the price they are selling at I didn’t realize they were half the size of what I normally buy for about the same price I have been using this facial cleanser for about 20 years now.  I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts, and this soap has helped my skin care routine so much!"
481,B00121TEQW,"Ever since the pandemic started, my hands have been dry to the point of cracking and bleeding. It's off and on. But being a stay-at-home mom w/ two toddlers and two dogs, I wash my hands A LOT. I was coating my hands in aquaphor and putting nitrile gloves over them every night. It was hard to find an alternative that didn't irritate all my little fissures of bloody cracks. I decided to take a chance on this. Starting with the small bottle. It only a few days, it has helped tremendously!! My hands were dry, just about to crack, and now they are just fine! I really can't believe it. Usually once they're that kind of dry, it becomes tough to recover with the cycle of constant hand washing. This stuff is great!HOWEVER, I will say, it smells like the slide grease I use on my trumpet. It's not off-putting to me, but may be to some. I'm alright smelling like I'm in the band room all day. Also, you definitely have to use it with damp, not wet and definitely not dry, hands. I learned this the hard way. A friend recommended this for dry cracked heels. I apply a thin layer of urea cream and allow it to dry and them apply cutemol to seal it in. It is the only thing that I have used that works. I had very deep cracks in my heels but they have closed and healed. Have been using it for several years for dry hands/cuticles and brittle nails.  First recommended to me by my dermatologist who uses it as well.  Takes a few weeks to correct initial condition, but used nightly helps keep hands and nails in good condition. My dermatologist recommended this because my fingernails were splitting at the tips.  She said it is due to excessive hand washing (guilty) and use of hand sanitizer (also guilty) which dries out the nail bed...but in my defense, I am a teacher of small humans.  Dr. said to put it on at bedtime each night and when the nails grow out they should be healthy again.  Night one and my hands were super soft in the morning.  I hope it works as she said on my fingernails.  It is a little thick going on until it soaks in, but I think it will be worth it. Used for dry, winter skin. I developed adult eczema. I had it as a child and it returned. This cream is a bit expensive, but worth every penny. I would suggest to get the 8oz. For some reason it goes a lot further. The 2 oz you have to buy more often. Idky.🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ Best cuticle cream/moisturizer I’ve found. This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  It’s super thick and holds moisture great.  Not greasy like Vaseline.  I use it mostly on my hands.  Absorbs well if you follow the instructions"
482,B0012TCFBA,"I bought this creme to see what all the hype was about. I’ve been using the Biologique Recherche durmapurifiante cream and decided to give this one to go since it got better reviews. The smell is wonderful, but it’s so incredibly thick I feel like it’s hard to even smear across your face. It takes a long time to soak into your skin, too. It’s like it just sits on your skin, caked on for the first 30 minutes. I like it, but I don’t think I’m in love with it. Unless I see drastic results from this cream, I will probably switch back to my old trusty. Best on the market. Nothing new on the market can top this This looks bad when I just opened it, and I explicitly took it to the shopping mall asking the counter staff to verify if it's authentic or fake. I was told it's authentic but it's not fresh, but not expired... However, only the top thin layer was dry, if you remove the top thin layer, underneath it's still creamy. The seller is friendly and has good attitude. So I bumped from 1 star to 3. So buy at your own discretion. In general it's ok. I HAVE USED LEmER FOR YEARS AND GREAT TO GET IT ON LINE Great gift for my wife a great price she loves it Yes I started using this cream years ago when Clinique stopped making the night cream I used for my skin during the day. I was surprised to find how well Creme de la Mer made my skin feel, especially in the winter when the heat goes on and my face feels like it is literally cracking even with other creams on it. I also use it often on my lips (and my kids loved it too) during the winter to keep them moist. I was using a cortisone cream around my eyes because that area would become so dry, I was able to stop after starting the Creme de la mer. It has become very expensive so I do look for sales but am glad I can still afford to use it. I have tried many other creams and some I can even use in the summer when there is humidity but in the winter, I would be lost without this cream. DO NOT BUY!!!! I think this product is fake. I recently about to finish my old one and opened this one. I was about it to use it. However I noticed something seems off when I applied it on my hand. The texture is weird and watery. The packaging is different than the real one that I got from La Mer. I got this thinking that it was real because at around that time the cosmetic company store had promotions and was selling it for cheaper than the price I paid for this one. I thought this was a resell. Turned out it was not."
483,B000PSPK7U,"I purchased this lotion because it smelled good, after using it for a couple of days I randomly noticed that my skin looked dewy and smooth. I love The the affect this lotion has had on my skin so I purchased more of this brand, different types. I was gifted the naked bee handcream and it has become my favorite!Thick and absorbs nicely and love the scent! ☺️ My granddaughter is a nurse.  This helps her hands not crack and stink.  She has a lot of the nurses and medical staff using this product This one was a gift, small tube for the money. The scent makes up for the size. Moisturize nice, no residues. The scent is not too strong- just enough to enjoy ant not overpower. This lotion is the best around.  Silky,  not greasy.  The orange scent is fabulous. I use all over my body,  face included.  It deserves a 10 star rating.  And,  the price is right. I love the product it’s a little expensive. My favorite hand moisturizer! I keep it in my desk drawer at work."
484,B001ANOONK,"I just got this on January 28 and I since using it January 29. Makes my lips super soft and hydrated all day. The orange taste is super good! It doesn't have that blossom smell or a flowery smell which is fine ( I'm not sure even what a orange blossom is just assuming a flower). it smells just like oranges! I loves this lip balm tried so many since I was little nothing worked. I keep it in fridge for cooling effect and to help it stay longer life. All my skincare goes in my fridge expect my face wash and face scrub bc I don't need them to have a cooling effect on my face ( wouldn't help my pores and pimps if I had them in the fridge bc cold can't help get rid of them only hot/warm water can). I’m always searching for the perfect lip balm. I can stop now…this is the best! A+ This is my favorite lip balm! It keeps my lips moisturized without burning feeling or drying after prolonged usage. Love the scent too! This lip balm works great for me, keeps my lips hydrated. I work outside in very hot to below zero weather, lips are always soft. Already did  I love this chapstick. It keeps my lips moisturized all day. Best because it lasts, doesn’t feel waxy, is smooth and light. Smells wonderful and not overpowering. Only chapstick I use."
485,B000GDA07E,"Small for amount paid. But happy it is here Nice I bought this 2 days ago and am in love.I usually use Rodan + Fields, but decided to try Murad because of the price.  I needed an eye cream and looked at the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try.  So glad I did.It makes my skin feel firmer instantly.  Love that I can put it on my lid as well.  My mother has droopy eyelids and I don't want to get them.  Most products can't be put there but this one is safe to do so.The only fly in the ointment is the bottle.  When I squirt out a full pump it's too much for one eye.  If I squirt out a half, it's not enough.  There must be a sweet spot somewhere in the middle.  I'll figure it out, and if that's the only problem, I can live with it.I would recommend this to a friend and will be buying more when I run out.  Love it. I needed a product to help with festoons that I got during chemo. Never had them before. This stuff worked great for me and quick. But for my typical wrinkle reducing I found my usual product worked better. I was about to order this from Sephora after trying it from my sister. It was around $80 at Sephora and I was hesitant to spend that much on an eye cream, so when I found it on amazon for much less, I ordered it almost immediately. Thought it might be a knock off, but it came in the original packaging and was authentic! Other eye creams don't do much for my dark circles but this did wonders! I have to use it twice a day for it to truly work. The consistency is very creamy and it doesn't make my eye area oily, sticky or very shiny like other eye creams because it absorbs into my skin very quickly (I previously used the Shiseido Benefiance WrinkleResist24 Intensive Eye Contour Cream) It also doesn't irritate my eyes like other creams do. I would repurchase this! I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine. Well, at 56 I just felt my skin wasn't looking great and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money). My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great. That was when I decided to invest in the entire Resurgence line of products. I started with the wash to day/night treatments, the mask etc. It was a costly order but the results are worth it! It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing. Even my husband noticed the difference. Don't waste money trying to 'save' money. I will never look for any other skin care products because I don't have to, I finally found what was right there for years! I first received a small sample size of Murad eye cream,  and by the time it was gone I knew I had to buy the full size.  It feels good on my skin-gentle and not too greasy, and the small wrinkles by my eyes weren't as noticeable.  It's a great product,  I recommend it! Typically I love this brand, I have been using Murad for years.  However as I am getting older and experiencing signs of aging, I was looking to them to find a solution for my under eye area for puffiness and dark circles.  I was going back and forth on whether I should purchase, but since I had enjoyed their other products for years and read the good reviews, I decided to take the plunge.  I started using it religiously every night… no reduction in puffiness or dark circles.  The reason I gave 3 stars - I do think it has helped with the suppleness under the eye and the cream absorbed nicely, however I think I can get that from many other products that are a little easier on the pocket book.  Needless to say, I will not be repurchasing this product, I'll stick to my cleansers from Murad."
486,B001G7R3JW,"It works on my stretch marks and texture is really buttery I ordered this after trying a much more expensive product right after I had my baby. That product was trash. This however seems to be effective. I am starting to see a difference just after using a couple of weeks. I will likely order another after finishing this one. It's worth a try. I feel like this product would have been great, but with being pregnant I can’t handle the scent, so I can’t use it.  They should make this fragrance free for all the smell sensitive pregnant women.It does leave your tummy pretty sticky as well. I wouldn’t put a shirt on right away after applying. As a disclaimer, I used this as a stretch mark prevention, not a stretch mark treatment. I used this every day on my belly, hips, and butt as soon as I started showing during both of my pregnancies and I never had any stretch marks. It is very thick and greasy, truly like putting butter on your skin. Not the most desirable feeling on your skin, but TOTALLY worth it to prevent stretch marks and itching. This product is a must for me during every pregnancy. I am using it from 2017 it’s really working by time We all know (who have them) that stretch marks can be very embarrassing.  I was nervous about getting stretch marks during my pregnancy since I have a few from when I rapidly gained water weight while taking a new medication (that I immediately stopped).  I have tried so many products to try and remove my previous stretch marks with little to no change.I want to clarify, I did not purchase this product to make my previous stretch marks disappear, I bought it to prevent new stretch marks from appearing during my pregnancy.  It worked PERFECTLY!  I did not get even ONE new stretch mark during my pregnancy. I started early in my pregnancy, before I even started to show to make sure my skin was well moisturized prior to it stretching to fit my little bundle of joy.My daily ritual was to apply the Palmer's Cocoa Oil then Palmer's Cocoa Butter morning and evening (and during the day if I had time/remembered).  Applying the oil helped the butter slide across my skin and absorb better.  The more I used the product the less product I actually needed since my skin eventually got the hydration it needed (since I don't usually moisturize).I was using Palmer's Cocoa lotion for pregnancy but found using all three was too much.  I liked the way the oil lathered onto my skin and the way the butter gave a long lasting all day/night working feel.A plus is the smell.  It's actually very pleasant and dose not have a chemical smell.  The texture is wonderful too.  The product absorbs very well.  My husband actually liked the smell and the fact that the product didn't just sit on the skin but absorbed, so he would help me put it on sometimes. This product doesn’t need to say it’s for stretch marks because my dr said trying rid stretch marks during pregnancy is a myth. I think they’d sell much more product just being honest. I used this during my pregnancy and after giving birth at least 2 times a day and I have no stretch marks. It leaves a very nice feeling on the skin and massaging is so comforting!"
487,B0016G2BJK,"I’ve used Dove shea butter body wash and bar soap for years and I love it. My daughter had this fragrance, and I was surprised how much I liked it. I don’t like flowery, sweet candles or soap, but this one is very mild. It’s nice to change up from time to time, and it’s Dove so the quality is excellent. It’s soap, and it’s refreshing!😊 My father was a dermatologist and I have been using this soap since age 5. My friends tell me I look like I'm in my 40's and I'm in my late 60's Why?  I HYDRATE my skin, DOVE is the best. Simply stated, it's The BEST!!! Love, love , the scent. My favorite Dove smell. Highly recommend to anyone with skin allergies. Smells wonderful and I put the bars I am not using yet into clothes drawers to keep them smelling pleasant.Suds right up and rinses easily I like using Dove soap. I use it to bathe. Smooth Like  the item"
488,B00008CMOR,"I love masks, creams, facial goops of all kinds, and the contents of my basket of facial products might have a higher retail value than a decent used car. And yet, no matter how many $120 night creams I try and reject, I always have this old-school peel mask around. Why? Not because of what it does on its own, but because of what it does in conjunction with those fancy-pants creams and serums.This mask does clear out your skin nicely, leaving the texture smoothed, that's true. But what it really does best, in my so-humble opinion, is it makes your skin THIRSTY. When you finish this mask, your face is ready to drink in whatever you put on it, double-time and double-the-benefits.Yes, this mask is cheap. Yes, the texture is much less pleasant than newer formulations of peel-off. Yes, your grandmother might well have had a faded tube of it sitting in her medicine cabinet. But grandma knew what she was doing.So here's my advice: Grab yourself a tube of this stuff. Slather it onto a clean, dry face. Make a weird expression at the thick, gloopy texture. Wince at the way it seems to gather into pale-purple snot balls on your cheeks as it slowly warms up while you're spreading it. Power through the rubber-cement-and-cheap-rum smell. Persevere until you've got a nice even layer, and then sit around for 20 minutes and let it dry. And then, once you've peeled it off? Grab a jar of your rootiest, tootiest, how-did-I-spend-this-much-money-on-face-cream product and smear it all over your face. Gape in wonder as your skin sucks down the cream/serum/oil/whatever in moments. Maybe apply a second coat of cream. Who's going to judge you? But when you're done, you'll know that this mask is one of the best things you ever bought. (Or, you won't, but you're out four bucks. But I think you will.)Oh. One more thing. The snot-ball effect is way lessened if you warm up your tube of gloop under the hot water tap for a few minutes. FYI. So I have used this product before a few years ago so I have something to compare with. I really do think that the one I got was expired or close to it. As it does not have a date on it its really hard to tell, but the mask was thicker then it should be when coming out. After applying it to my face it doesn't dry well everywhere which is the problem I was having when I had mine for a very long time. I have tried applying liberal amounts to thin coatings and still it doesn't try well. Last time I used it, it was horrible I barely got the stuff off because it wouldn't dry. I will try to order again maybe I just got a bad one and if its better will happily change my review. I would not expect this product to solve any ongoing problems for you (i.e. acne, pores, blackheads), but it IS a great mask. I have sensitive skin that is acne prone, and I try to use this once/week to rejuvenate my skin.  I love how clean, fresh, and glowy I look after using it. In fact, I have taken to using it for special nights out and such because my skin looks a little brighter and feels much softer.Word of advice - wear a headband/pony tail when putting this on, or those little hairs that sweep around your face will end up stuck to it.Cleanse your skin well before using this, with warm water to open the pores.  Blot your skin dry and apply a thin layer to your face. Yes, it's goopy and sticky, but it's not bad once you get used to it.  I usually put a grape-sized spot right in the middle of my cheek, then use my fingers to spread it around.  I apply only with my right hand so that I don't end up with TWO sticky hands.Leave it on for at least 10 minutes; a few minutes longer if it still feels damp in spots. At the end of my time, I get a few fingertips barely damp, then rub them near my temples to loosen up the mask enough for me to pull off.If the whole mask won't pull off, just use a warm washcloth to gently wipe it away.  Moisturize after! I put this on my forehead, between my eyebrows and slightly above. I create a soft v like shape and as it dries it tightens. Usually I do this before bed and when I wake up my lines are softened. If I forget and they’re particularly deep in the morning, I’ll do it then. It helps to plump the skin and relax the muscles. It’s great for targeting certain areas. Doesn’t have to be used as an all over mask. Much cheaper than the sticky pads that claim to do the same thing but don’t last very long. I love peel-off masks for the way they pull off one more dry layer of skin after I exfoliate. I like pretty much all of them I've tried, but the coolest thing about this one is that, when it dries, (and that takes a pretty long time to get it fully dry), it has the weirdest smooth feeling.  You just want to rub your fingers across it again and again because it feels so cool. It really stays intact once dry and peels off all in one piece. Feels good, too.  I also stumbled across a second benefit to using it-- I hate it when I dye my hair and dye gets on my face or makes my hairline look irregular for a few days, which happens ev en though  I always use a barrier cream along my hairline to prevent this.  I guess some dye goes through the cream.  Last time I dyed, I used this mask as the barrier and let it start to dry before I applied the color. It protected my hairline perfectly and when little wisps of hair fell against my face, as they always seem to do when I dye, no problem. I just pulled the whole thing off and no problems!  The Queen Helene mask worked better than all the others for this purpose. I will never dye my hair without giving myself this facial mask treatment again!"
489,B0000536EK,"Used this oil my first pregnancy and it worked so well!  This is and prenatals were the first things I ordered with my second pregnancy. I don’t love the cocoa butter smell but it’s faint and doesn’t linger. I apply as soon as I get out the shower and make sure to do the sides of my belly/waist and lower back/hips  bc all that skin stretches! A light oil, so I follow with avocado oil and then a heavy cream to lock it all in. They say that stretch marks can’t be prevented because it’s hereditary but I beg to differ.Started using this after a cousin in law told me about it. I believe I was 4 months then. I started using it a lot, reapplying every 3-4 hrs up until recently. Now I do twice a day, morning and night.Im 32 weeks now and not a stretch mark in sight. I’ve gotten really big too compared to prepregnancy with many commenting that im “really big” for being 7 months… my sister and mom both had stretch marks starting around 5-6 months, so I thought I for sure was going to get them. Even if I end up getting them in the remaining weeks of my term, I still think it has at least reduced the amount I will get.The oil smells almost like light peanut butter. Every time I put it on, my dog can’t help but try to lick my hands because it smells like peanut butter lolI seen some commenting that it doesn’t absorb well… it absorbs very well after a shower. If you are applying and haven’t showered, all you have to do is rub it in your palms for a short while til the oil gets a little warm then it will absorb better.One last thing, if you suffer from sensitive skin and get itchy while you’re pregnant, this oil helps A LOT!I will most def buy for post pregnancy and future pregnancies. First of all, I am NOT pregnant. I just wanted a good skin oil.I have normal skin, not super dry, but not oily like when I was a kid. I live at 7,000 feet elevation in the desert and am out in the (constant) sun and wind every day.I use this ALL OVER MY ENTIRE SELF. I mix it with my body lotion to create this amazing concoction that makes my skin so happy.Recently I started mixing it with my vitamin E face cream and holy moly it's amazing. I had no idea I should have been using oil on my face this whole time! I see the difference! The texture of my skin is smoother and bouncier, brighter, more even, and my pores are less prone to blackheads.It absorbs into my skin beautifully! Even if I use it straight I do not get an oily layer on top of my skin.The scent is very subtle and only smells like the oils because they do NOT add fragrance. (THANK YOU)The dispenser can get a little messy and I don't recommend traveling with this bottle. This was recommended to me.  I'm pregnant and have been using.  I like the smell and very moisturizing. No complaints. I’m not sure if the oil got frozen or something . Used this throughout both of my pregnancies and the scent is nice and light and it feels so nice on your growing skin. Highly reccomend. I live this product. It’s a wonderful treat to indulge and bond with your baby and engage in self- care. This is my third pregnancy and I wish I had found this product for my first two pregnancies. I definitely recommend this product!! I plan to use post-natal as well!! This stuff is super moisturizing. Stretch marks are genetic, so in my case they couldn’t be entirely prevented but I really feel like this helped.  I’m 6 weeks postpartum and using this to heal and my stretch marks are fading very quickly. I also have been using it on my cracked heels and my feet have never been softer!I will say that when I was pregnant I was using this and the smell was unbearable - like chocolate mixed with rotting plastic. I had to switch between this and another brand some days. My husband didn’t understand and now that I’m not pregnant anymore, I get his confusion. There really isn’t a scent at all. Pregnancy hormones are wild. But buyer beware that it may not smell great if you don’t like cocoa butter and have heightened senses."
490,B0018V1DWE,"I absolutely love these microdermabrasion crystals! My skin feels so soft after using them, and it definitely gets rid of the dead skin layer on my face. My skin looks bright and younger every time. I mix this with my facial cleanser and it is amazing. Makes my face feel and look amazing I’ve had the same bottle since 2012.  Continuous use. That’s a pretty decent value! I have bought several products from Skin Obsession and I absolutely love every single one of them. This one is no exception... I love it too! It is a small bottle!  Other reviewers complained about the size. I guess they did not understand what they were buying because I knew it was going to be a small bottle, however you are only using a small amount every time. Even with a small bottle I see this lasting for a while. I use a little bit with my daily cleanser which is Cetaphil and I think it works perfectly. These crystals are not something I'm going to use every day but definitely see a benefit to using it once every week. These leave my skin feeling smooth and soft and by using the Skin Obsession products I have had clear skin for a long time. I am very very pleased and would recommend Skin Obsession products to anyone with problem skin.By the way I just turned 38 this summer and I have experienced adult onset acne for the last few years. It was never horrible but it was enough to make me self-conscious and it was regularly during certain times of the month sometimes hormonal, sometimes not. Whatever the cause of my acne was, Skin Obsession has definitely improved my complexion, my pore size, and reduced the number of breakouts significantly. They are nearly non-existent and have been for a long time. I really love these products!7/7/19This little bottle has lasted two years with weekly and biweekly use. I'm getting ready to order again. Anyone on the fence about this product really should try it! I'm not going to mince words here: this is the best exfoliator I've ever tried. That's saying a lot since as a former makeup artist and recent skin care junky I've tried more exfoliating formulas than I can count and have always gone back to the same one (Clinique) for over 25 years.The crystals are the perfect size and texture; I could not imagine them being effective by the looks - they are super fine, smaller than table salt grains yet, extremely effective. You just need a tiny bit and it works with just water!After one use, the skin on my face felt totally transformed. Not exaggerating here; my health has been facing a bit of a challenge over the past several months and I was put back on cortico steriods which just ruin the skin. Dull complexion, breakouts, dryness, hyper-pigmentation and the list goes on. Over the past few months I had been re-trying ALL of my old five star standbys but had very little success at bringing my skin back to where it was prior to the change in prescription status. With just the first use of the crystals the difference was dramatic!My face was a little red for about two hours after using the crystals so I'd suggest you don't use this just prior to going out. After the redness subsided, my pores looked smaller, my skin appeared less dull/more healthy, the dry patches were gone and my face felt softer than it has in months. And that's all after ONE use.Such a tiny bottle - worth every penny and then some though; this size should last for months.Well, my skin still has a ways to go before it's restored to a condition I'd call *glowing* but this is a HUGE first step in the right direction.Will *definitely* purchase again and HIGHLY recommended. I started using this product in Fall 2008. We are now a couple months away from Fall 2010.Here are the pros and cons of this product:Pros:1) A little goes a long way. A bottle of this product can last a couple months!2) It's just Aluminum Oxide crystals. I can't use a lot of products because of severe allergies, but this product does not irritate my skin at all.3) I have had professional microderm treatments before, and I think this is pretty comparable in the way it makes my skin feel after I use it.4) For the type of product you get and how long it lasts, it's pretty cheap.5) I feel like it improves the appearance of my skinCons:1) You are not getting the amount advertised. As noted in an earlier review, this is pretty dishonest. Of course, they may be looking at the overall shipping weight. But still, the manufacturers should advertise the amount of CRYSTALS in the bottle.2) Did I say bottle in Con # 1? Yes, yes I did. You do not get the cute clear plastic container advertised. You get a plastic bottle: the type you'd put your favorite shampoo in while on vacation. As a result, you can't really get all of it out at the end.So that's my review. Seriously, for as cheap as it is, just give it a try. I would be interested in knowing if someone finds a comparable product from a different vendor, and how much it costs."
491,B0011DL8T2,"Very soothing on the face after a day in the wind. I love this! Smells like roses and is very soothing. Love that they put tape on the bottle so it didnt leak! I use this project a lot. It smell great and moisturize my hair nicely. I use this to set my makeup. This is much cheaper than Scindinavia, and works just as well if not better. Sometimes I go a little crazy with makeup, ya know, layers of foundation, concealer, blush, bronzer, contouring, and then I like to powder bake to make my lines go away. At the end,  there are so many layers that look great on camera, but in real life- everyone can tell you have makeup on. So I spray this 4-10 times all over, and it doesn't erase the work I've done on my face- it just makes it stick to my skin (don't worry it doesn't FEEL sticky). It also gives me a glow from within despite all the layers I have, so it really makes it seem like I have great glowy skin. I can't live without this product now, and it's going to be in my makeup arsenal forever (or until the obviously powdered face becomes a style). I love this product! After watching many youtube beauty gurus use this product as a primer ( prep before applying foundation), I had to try it out myself and at such an affordable cost, why not?  I put a little bit of the rosewater on a cotton pad and apply it thinly to my face and let it absorb into my skin for a few minutes. After that , I apply my foundation on top and do the rest of my makeup. Im not entirely sure if this product keeps my makeup on or not BUT the super nice but not overly powerful rose smell alone is enough for me to want to repurchase it again and again. I have had the product for a few months and it is still about 1/4 full as I don't always remember to apply it. Overall, great smelling product and would repurchase and recommend to others. It works at its best, I personally love rose water smell and I used it as my toner, works really well This is a gift for my 96 year old mother that used Glycerin and Rosewater for 70-80 years on her face and hands and she looks to be in her 70's , not almost 100. We had not been able to find it for a number of years and when I found it on Amazon I ordered one for part of her Mother's Day gift. The smell is the same or similar to what she loves.If she likes it as much as I think she will I will order in quantity next time. I used this for two types of DIY conconctions. Once DIY hair and DIY skin lotions. The DIY hair had a mix of cayenne pepper and Dr. Adorable Peppermint Castor oil. I yielded 2.5' of new growth within 3 weeks doing the greenhouse method. For the DIY lotion, I used several oils, lotions with this rosewater and glycerin water and added epsom salt and have had the best exfoliating lotion ever. I have no dry skin on my body. My skin is smooth and the glycerin has allowed the lotions to enter into the skin wonderfully."
492,B0012E2I8A,"I love the smell of this Rose blend. It comforts me and brings peaceful feelings. I have used the Rose oil from Auric blends for years. Still my favorite scent When you retire (after working 48 years!), some old habits have to, sadly, die by the wayside. Buying perfume is top of the list.All my working years, I was known for the various perfumes I wore. In the 60s it was Jungle Gardenia. Everyone wore it because Liz Taylor said it was her favorite scent. And, at that time, she and Richard Burton were #1 on the gossip charts. Even though it was way too heavy for me, personally, I wore it for years. In the 70s I wore White Shoulders. In the 80s it was Diorisimo. This was allegedly Princess Diana's favorite perfume. In the 2000s Jo Malone fragrances were my favorites. Still are. That said, I cannot afford to go into one of her lovely stores in Manhattan and buy a bottle and a couple of bars of her perfumed soap any longer. It comes down to perfume or eating homemade soup for a month! No contest.I researched all the perfumes on Amazon and then decided to try the perfumed oils.  I looked at all the choices for days before deciding on Rose by Auric Blends. I love it!  It goes on strong and lasts all day. It is an authentic rose scent, not some synthetic watered down mix. It compliments everything I am wearing from casual to night out. It isn't overpowering but isn't wimpy either.I keep it in a dark, cool place in my bathroom to keep it from evaporating and losing it's scent.  I wear it every day, not only on special occasions. A lady sitting next to me on the Subway last weekend commented on how wonderful it smelled. She was really surprised when I told her what it was and where I bought it.  I don't know what I did before amazon. Well, actually, I do.  I spent every Saturday walking from one end of Manhattan to the other end searching for items I needed. Now I just go to Amazon and find everything I need.  I really love this oil.  Highly recommend it to anyone who wants a rich rose scent that doesn't cost $100 an ounce. Great choice. This is such a beautiful scent! Pros:1. Really does smell like roses2. Long-lasting perfume that stays on throughout most of the day and moderate activity levels3. The scent is downright soothing when tapped onto a pillow4. Great price (as of this review)Cons:1. VERY strong and very easy to put too much on. Rose is a naturally overpowering scent and Auric Blends Rose perfume oil can be very overpowering if you cross the delicate line between too much and just right.2. A few of my friends and family have said that the scent reminds them of scented baby powder or a bath salts.I love Auric Blends Rose perfume oil! If you are looking for a perfume that really smells like a rose bush, this one is a must have. The smell is strong and lasts most of the day (I work outside and inside at a state park and love having a perfume that will stay on me for most of the day to offset the sweaty smell most of the us rangers and volunteers tend to get). I would really recommend this to anyone looking for a rose scented perfume. I ordered a bottle in April 2020 and liked it enough that I bought a second bottle in October 2021 to give as a gift. The original bottle had a clear oil inside and was VERY strong, but as long as I only use a small dab on each wrist, it is a nice rose scent that lasts for hours. The new bottle has a YELLOW oil inside. It is also very strong, so I tested it out with a small dab on each wrist. This new oil smells somewhat rancid along with the rose scent. The rose scent dissipated quickly, leaving just the rancid smell and some overpowering ""perfumey"" smell behind, so I had to try washing it off. Even with only using a small dab, it left me with a huge headache. It's not returnable and I'm super disappointed that I will just have to throw it in the trash. This is the same rose scent that you probably smelled in your grandmother's powder or rose scented soap.  There is nothing particularly exotic or alluring about it, but if you are looking for a nice quality, budget friendly, long lasting, very distinctively ROSE perfume oil this is it.As others have stated, it's potent and gets even stronger once your skin has had a chance to warm it so go easy.  One tiny dab on the pulse point at the back of the knee is probably all you want and you'll be trailing rose scent all day.  Anything closer to your face might be headache inducing.If you are looking for something more exotic, layer this on with another scent and try your hand at the art of perfumery. Nice with the tiniest touch of musk, vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, something green, something fruity, oriental scents, etc. Rose varieties all smell a little different and you can create your own special rose scent with a little touch of something else. When I read the 2 and 3 star reviews complaining that the rose smell was overwhelming I knew I found what I've been looking for. I wanted an oil that made me smell like I fell in a rose bush and laid there for hours. Let me tell you............one small roll on your skin goes a long way. When I kept seeing the remarks of the strong rose smell I brought two bottles immediately. The oils came in the mail this morning and I immediately placed a very small amount on my wrist. Six hours later I'm still smelling like a rose garden. I've gotten several compliments about it already. ""Mmmm, you smell so good. What are you wearing?"" is the common question asked. I have brought a few oils in the past only to be disappointed in the end by the faint scent of rose. With this oil there is no mistaken. It's definitely a rose perfume oil. I have a feeling these two bottles will last me the rest of the year. Very satisfied."
493,B0009ET6BQ,"I use their vitamin c serum and then put this moisturizer on top. Afterwards I follow up with my tinted sunscreen. Iv been using this for almost two months. At first my skin broke out from the vitamin c serum perfume my skin but now that it’s purged my skin is super clear and glowy. Es excelente para piel sensible e hudrata muy bien 👍🏻 I use this after my face wash. You can definitely feel how it moisturizes right away. A little goes a long way. The sent is just right. Love that it comes in a glass jar. I used it on my neck and hands. I recommend this. At first I was worried product would cause breakouts, which it hasn't. this is a good product for my skin during the winter and I can tell/feel my skin face, neck and décolletage have responded to the ingredients as promised. I will purchase this again in the future as a little bit of product goes a long way. My skin is super dry and I break out still. This works and isn’t greasy and doesn’t make me break out. Wish I found it long ago. The night cream is way better tho. I really very much wanted to like this. I didn't give up using it despite not liking it, and after half the cream gone, I still very much almost hate this. I have lots of products from this line, and I really love all of them. But this cream  - upon application my face becomes red. Why? No friggin idea, but it does go away in about 5-10 mins. It is not burning or itchy, so it is not allergy that is causing it I think. This happened also to a person who I tried to give away the cream to - he got the same effect from using it. I kept using then since it didn't seem like an allergy. But even after the redness goes away, the face feels rather matified instead of moisturized. I tried to apply this on dry skin, damp skin, wet skin, but nothing helped improve the texture. It is as though when it gets absorbed on top of my face, it becomes a drying texture. Not a fan of this particular product, at least for myself. I have very dry skin and I was struggling since I was unable to find a good cream for my skin. Then I tried this one and I realized I found the right one! It completely changed my skin that now looks much better and glowing. The cream has also a very subtle scent, very enjoyable! Love this stuff… it goes VERY well under my makeup - my face is not greasy or oily during the day, which is what I found with a lot of other “day creams”. Not as moisturizing as I’d hoped, but maybe that’s a good thing. I’ll continue to buy and use."
494,B001E724VG,"I have a five year old and another one going to turn two at the end of this month. I have had great luck using lavendar and low lighting to help mellow them out in the evening, and specifically bought this bubble bath to help relax my children so that I can get them to bed a little easier. You don't often find good quality lavendar bubble bath in children's products, so after reading the great reviews on this particular product, I decided to give it a try.  My children often still take their evening bath together and I have used about a bottle and a half in the last month - with an average of every-other night use.  The bottles could easily last a very long time if being used just occassionally for an adult or for a special treat.  The product bubbles very nicely in our hard water... the bubbles do not last that long, though; but it isn't exactly like my kids are lying and soaking... they are playing in the tub and making it a point to handle the suds.  Mr. Bubble doesn't last any longer with my two... so I cannot take off any stars based on the bubbles.The scent is a decently strong true lavendar smell - not a perfumy lavendar, but the smell you would smell if you took and rubbed a lavendar plant between your palms.  It is a somewhat raw, earthy, green smell that might be off-putting at first.  The scent does dilute nicely once in the bath water and I have NOT noticed that it lingers on my children's skin even when my son gets out of the tub before I get to their final soap down and rinse.  Neither of my children have had any skin reaction, (even if not properly rinsed) but their skin is not overly sensitive.  The one thing I did worry about is that it might sting their eyes, but neither have had issues with that either.  In summery, I do feel confident recommending this product to help calm you and your little ones.  If you are used to the scent in most ""lavendar"" products; then this will smell different to you, and I worry that people will take the initial sniff and get the smell ""stuck"" in their nose and not give it a fair chance.  If this is your first experience with this product, I suggest avoiding the temptation to open the bottle and take a big whiff... instead, let your first impression be that of the product in a tub full of water. Pros: When I got this bubble bath 3 pack I got it for the insanely low price of $0.96. Honestly I am more impressed with Amazon than I am this product (Amazon posted the wrong price by accident but honored the advertised price because the error was their mistake) this makes me love amazon even more than I all ready do. For 96 cents it was an awesome deal but I think you can get similar or better bubble bath for the regular price of over $30. Smells greatCons: Doesn't make very thick layer of foamy bubbles and when you get in a lot of the bubbles die :( Smells nice but smell isn't as intense as I would personally like.Overall: If you are looking for lavender bubble bath and have some extra money burning a hole in your pocket then by all means get this bubble bath. However if you are on fixed income like me and can't afford $30 for bubble bath then either find something cheaper or hope that they make an error in price again so you can get an awesome deal like I did. One bottle of bubble bath arrived in damaged condition -- at least half of the bottle had leaked over the entire shipment.Fortunately the 2 books were not damaged -- probably because they were on top of the bottles. But everything else was drenched in lavender.Please replace.5/1/16I'm asking once again that one bottle of EO's Lavender Bubble Bath be replaced since it was damaged in shipment.Interesting that you ask for reviews but do nothing about damaged items.What do I need to do in order to have this taken care of??? These bottles of bubble bath are great. They foam well, smell great and keep the girlfriend happy. A three pack will hold you out for a while if you use the amount wisely, and can be a good investment if you tend to take baths often and want to relax.The biggest problem will be the shipping- the bottles are wrapped lightly in plastic to prevent leaking into the box, but it doesn't actually prevent leaking in itself. One of the bottles leaked a bit, which covered everything inside the bag in goop. A quick hot rinse took care of the problem, but it could have been worse.Packaging is a no, and I do have to take away a star, because of the volume lost as a result. Otherwise, go for it. And enjoy. I was worried about the bubbles lasting on this product based upon some reviews and that my last non-sulfate product only had bubbles return when I turned jets back on.  I need not have worried.  In fact, the bubbles were hard to eliminate down the drain as they stubbornly existed.  I could have molded a miniature statue out of these suckers!The scent was excellent and relaxing and not feminine.  Just real lavender scent that did not linger.  As a man, I was worried that I'd smell like a flower all day - have no fear! I got three bottles of this when it was priced as a promotional item ....it was .96 for three bottles!!!!  I believe Amazon and the supplier were inundated with orders because it took about a month to get it filled, but it actually came with no extra charge.  What can I say?  It's soap liquid....it smelled nice, it lathered nice and it seems to be a ""natural"" product (EO brand) which has to be better than those other products loaded down with chemicals.  And for about .35 a bottle, I could use it to clean out my toilet and still be making money (I actually use it in some refillable hand soaps throughout the house since I'm more of a shower person myself). I like the product.  And, there's nothing to dislike.  It's the right consistency and the bubbles are great.  The scent is not too much, just right. Works as advertised."
495,B000URVDRW,"It was perfect The ingredients are: Coral Reef Sea Salt, Safflower Seed Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Organic Coconut Oil, Orange Oil, Citrus Peel Oil, Spearmint Leaf Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Menthol, Anise Oil, Fennel Oil, Vitamin E.The smell is very subtle and is not lingering. The only smells I get are spearmint/menthol/coconut even though orange oil, and citrus peel are listed above them in the ingredients. I would have preferred a citrus smelling product as there's nothing like citrus to make one feel invigorated, fresh and clean. I would have loved this product more if not for the spearmint/menthol smell. On the plus side, the smell, like in the other body polishes in this line, is very subtle, so it's not hard to ignore the smell.The sea salt crystals give a slightly rougher scrub than the sugar scrubs. If you like a gentler polish, opt for one of the sugar polishes. With them you also have a range of aromas to choose from. I chose the lemongrass tangerine, and there, since I love citrus smells, I wish the smell were stronger and lingered more!It's a truly natural product with no chemicals. That also means that the chemicals that will keep a product at an ideal level of softness/hardness are absent (which is a good thing!), so you will have to take the extra trouble to melt this product in cooler weather before you can use it. I leave it over a floor vent for about 30 minutes and keep a small metal spoon in the shower to mix the ingredients prior to using.With a textured shower floor, the oil doesn't pose a slipping hazard.This makes skin look glistening and oily before toweling off, but after toweling off, it tones down and the skin just looked well moisturized. The oily look and feel doesn't remain. So I don't see a problem using this in the warmer months as well.Vegan, not tested on animals, all natural, organic ingredients which are all great. Product works well. Would have been five stars if it smelled of citrus. I love that this is cruelty free, vegan, free of synthetic fragrance and has such a short and simple list of ingredients! I have been using this with every shower since I got it 8 days ago and the container is half empty. I was skeptical at first that the oilyness it leaves on my skin would make me break out but it has not. I have noticed an improvement in my skin, it is not dry and is smoother and softer. When I got this the oil had completely separated from the sugar  and the sugar was solid on the bottom so I had to give it a stir with a spoon. In the shower the oil also is usually separated in a puddle so I just keep a spoon with it, I prefer scooping it out with a spoon anyway. I love the scent, smells like pineapple in the shower and leaves a lasting fragrance in my bathroom. Later on my skin smells sweet like coconut. With all of these positive things there is one negative that I am not taking away any stars for because I feel it can't be helped, it's oily. Therefore in the shower this can be very dangerous! I have a shower with seats and a washcloth bar that I use to help me from falling so that helps. I start from the top of my body and work my way down rinsing with pretty warm water as I go and when I get to my feet I sit and do one at a time and rinse while I am sitting and it is still very slippery! Maybe a bath mat would help or maybe a hand towel laid on the shower floor? I'm not sure as I haven't tried. Be mindful though, this stuff has a warning label for a reason! If I had one of those ceramic tub/showers instead of plastic I'm pretty certain I would have fallen by now. I noticed some reviewers saying they got expired product, so I checked for the date on mine but there is no expiration date, I did however find the date that it was manufactured which was on 10/15, so it's only about 3 months old. I've used other scrubs before and usually thought they were ""just OK."" The only reason I bought this was because of reviews I'd read about coconut oil and scrubs helping out with keratosis pilaris, and I've recently decided that I've had it with the ""chicken skin"" on my legs and upper arms getting in the way of my tank tops and sleeveless dresses.This stuff is AMAZING!!! It really does smell like coconut and pineapple, feels nice to scrub with, doubles as shaving cream for super smooth legs (surprise!), and best of all, helped get rid of the bumps!!! I was so happy. I had literally been resigned to just having dotty, bumpy skin all my life. This scrub, in combination with the Exfoliator Loofah Sponge that I also found on Amazon, left me with smoother skin than I've ever had after JUST ONE SHOWER. A previous reviewer mentioned that they didn't even need to use lotion after using this product. Now, if you're at all like me, lotion is a must. Skipping lotion after a shower?? Welcome to ashy. But GET THIS--those reviews aren't lying!!! This product gives you the exfoliation of the sugar scrub, and then locks in the moisture with incredibly emollient coconut oil. I literally pat dry and get dressed right out of the shower...no lotion necessary!I should point out that there are two drawbacks: the main ingredient is coconut oil, so it'll make your shower build up with oil/get slippery. Also, if you do choose to use this to shave, it will clog up your razor. Like, FAST. I wouldn't try it with a razor that isn't one of the disposable kind that you only use a couple times anyway. For skin this smooth, I couldn't care less. I definitely will always keep this on hand from now on. This is my new favorite body scrub. The peppermint is so refreshing; I love using this scrub after a hard workout. My husband even commented about how soft my skin is after I use it. I did learn the hard way to be careful when you rinse so it doesn't get into your ""girl parts..."" that stays will you for a while. It's a lovely blend that I will definitely purchase again for myself and as gifts for friends!"
496,B00164DUY2,"Great product to keep skin clear.  I used in conjunction with the AHA on chest and back and was clear in a couple months.  My problem wasn’t severe, but bad enough I wore shirts up to my neck.  I used twice a day 10-12 hours apart.  I didn’t feel I needed the extra step with the BP.  I washed with the cleanser, let my skin dry 15 minutes then applied AHA.  After being clear for a year I went down to just cleansing and treating with AHA at night.  After a few months I would treat every other night and now I don’t treat at all, but I still use this cleanser. The product itself works very well. I have extremely sensitive skin but this is the best cleanser I have found so far. After using this on my face, my skin does turn slightly red, but like I said, this is to be expected because I have such sensitive skin. Overall though, this product has been the most gentle on my face compared to everything else I’ve tried. I can already see a slight difference after only a week of using it, twice daily. The reason I gave it four stars is because the bottle arrived broken. The top of the bottle where you press down was broken and product was leaking out of cracks on the tube of the lid, which was disappointing. I originally bought the travel size and now I upgraded. I love this cleanser. I have always struggled with acne and as a 23 year old I still had constant (albeit not as bad as my teens) blemishes. I use it twice a day and there is a legitimate change in how clear my skin is. Not 100% but huge. I've never liked a cleanser as much as I like this one. I love how gentle it is and that it foams. It dries very quickly on my skin and so I only have to let it sit for as long as it takes me to brush my teeth. It works quickly and gently. Love this. This is the best product for anyone who has ever struggled with acne! It is honestly life-changing. This is not a sponsored review. It is just that awesome. I'm pretty sure I've tried every highly recommended acne product out there in the last 5 years. This tops them all.I started struggling with acne as an adult. Cystic acne, which is painful and causes severe pore damage and scarring. My journey has taken 5 years and I've spent so much money on so many products that didn't work. First I tried proactive and it made no difference whatsoever. I went the opposite route and only used simple over the counter cleansers like neutrogena, but that didn't help. I bought water purifiers for my shower and sink because I thought my skin was reacting to toxins in the water, but that didn't work. I switched to Mario badescu and spoke with a specialist and bought the whole regime which helped a little, The ""buffering cream"" in particular. But I had to be painfully religious with it (including wearing masks to bed every night) and even then I would still break out. I changed my diet and cut out all gluten soy dairy and sugar for 9 months. But that still didn't work. I took prescribed medication. And that worked while I took it but quickly stopped working when I was off of it. I took over the counter medication. Supplements... You name it.Finally, I came across this product while watching a YouTube video. The testimonials were pretty convincing. And so I went for it. After a month of religiously using it I noticed a huge difference. My skin was still covered in bumps and small breakouts but the cystic acne was gone. Within three months, my skin was even. By six months I had clear skin with occasional breakouts. By 8 months, my skin was gloriously even clear and normal. Scarring went away almost entirely. My pores were smaller. I use it now about 5 times a week and I never breakout. I still need to use it regularly but not as religiously. Now I get compliments on my skin. When I tell people about my battle with my skin, they don't believe me.The large bottles of the regimen lasted me about 8 months. Currently, I use the large bottle of the cleanser and regular sizes of the other 3 creams. I do use the glycolic acid as well and recommend it. If you're camping or don't have access to water, you can use cleansing face wipes and go through the rest of the regimen as you normally would.So there's my long-winded recommendation and way more information than you needed to know.If you're struggling with severe acne, get this. It really works. Stick with it. Don't give up. And you'll be so happy you did. This face wash is IT! I will never use anything else, I trust it. It has absolutely zero scent & isn’t over drying, plus you really get a lot of product for your money, my bottle I purchased back in October 2020 has lasted me til now, I’m not even out yet! After suffering from acne for the first time in my life this past year (‘mask-ne’, thanks 2020) I started doing research & discovered this product through a reposted tik tok video of a girl showing what she used to clear her skin. She showed this face wash & the Rugby benzoyl peroxide, so that’s what I bought back in October, and now it’s April, I’ve officially taken 3 months off of work since quitting my job in January so I’ve been home, haven’t been wearing a mask, and this face wash + that benzoyl peroxide, along with KeyConcepts acne patches (pictured) have i combination made a huge world of difference in my skin. I would recommend all three of these products but the acne wash is a MUST. I use this and the lotion and my 50 years of fighting acne is over. Get the moisturizer too is all great."
497,B000F63OG6,"From previous statements about this Olay Regenerist Targeted Tone Enhancer it seems that the product made in the middle of the last decade was imperfect.  The flaws must have been addressed because now the package insert is correct - the age spots are diminished and the skin is toned.  This is not the same as having cosmetic surgery/treatments in a medical setting, but for those whose problems are minor (small spots, early skin aging) it doe indeed work. One excellent aspect of this product is that it does not plug pores which would lead to comedones. It is worth the investment if the expectations are right.  It would seem that the product has been finessed by Olay - they are a company who constantly upgrades their offerings.  Grady Harp, December 11 I have been using Oil Of Olay for over 20 years. I am an African American woman in her 50's.  I started using Olay Regenerist Targeted Tone Enhancer about 2 years ago, when the dark spots on my face were getting worse with age.  This has been the best product.  It has made my cheeks looks even toned, and a lot of the spots are gone and I don't have any new spots on my cheeks.  It is nice and creamy and makes my skin feel very nice all day.  I only apply it once in the morning.  I also use Oil Of Olay skin cream with this during the day.  I would say just be patient to the people who say, this does not work.  Give it some time it will work in the long run. At 58 my skin has gone thru the era of `no one knew about the hazard of direct sun lighton your skin without anything to protect it...I even used baby oil to advance the burn/tanningprocess. So I have a few spotting issues. I've tried MANY products to diminish these sunspots and this is the BEST so far that I have found. The problem I find is that I cannotfind it at Walgreens, Hyvee or Walmart. So thanks for this great find. I bought this for my wife but after 1 application, my vision got real blurry.  Her friend told me SHE was supposed to put it on.  Didn't say that on the directions.  They need to be more specific. So glad to have found this product again. Wish they still sold in stores. It has helped fade the brown spots. Even prevents an unexpected zit when it pops up! Will buy again when needed. After a month the my recent adult acne scars have faced nicely. The tone enhancer works for me.  I'm in my 60's and it lightens a lot of the age spots I have.  It doesn't make them totally disappear but lightens them noticeably.  I use it in the morning and before going to bed.  Just cover the area with a dab, rub it in and forget it!!  Takes about 2 weeks to begin to notice a difference. I'll use up the bottle but probably not buy it again. I can't see much difference in my complexion even after a month. But the, I was looking for a miracle and the advertising kind of promised a miracle. Will I never learn?"
498,B001E5D0L6,"Warning! Warning! Danger, Will Robinson! The palm oil used in this soap is highly destructive to the environment. Palm oil is grown on plantations cleared from rain forest, causing violations of indigenous people's rights, loss of plant and animal habitat which endangers species, soil erosion, global warming, and so on. Our close and adorable relatives the orangutans are being eradicated. Along with other rare species. Palm plantations are a major cause for loss of rain forest.  Indonesia and Malaysia (where this oil comes from) have been found to use forced child labor in remote areas. The third world farm workers are exploited by the large refiners who pay them very little. One with Nature should switch to certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) and palm kernel oil (CSPKO) even if it means raising the price a little bit.(One with Nature gets their palm oil from the Malaysian Government's  ""Malaysian Palm Oil Board"", ""The custodian of the Malaysian palm oil industry"" which ""forms the economic backbone of Malaysia "".  It claims to ""balance"" sustainability with economic needs. It appears to mean that this is just the same as all unsustainable palm oil because it is not certified as sustainable by any NGO but has the cover of the Malaysian government to soothe consumers like us. The Malaysian palm oil producers have to wage their own public relations campaign to protect their business. I'm sure they also don't want to totally wreck their land which means they have to work towards sustainability. But IMO this doesn't mean that palm oil used by One With Nature is environmentally friendly, it's just the regular cheap harmful oil. Bye-bye orangutans.)Still I am not dropping the review stars because child labor and killing orangutans doesn't decrease the quality of the soap itself even though it's obviously a great reason not to buy it. I list some other good and safe bar soaps below that do use environmentally friendly oils. As much as this is my favorite soap after doing this research my conscience as atrophied as it is will make it hard to buy more.One with Nature does work with EcoPeace Middle East to promote cooperation among Jews and Arabs in protecting the environment and the Dead Sea in particular.Positives for this soap:* No harmful chemicals. Saponified vegetable oils like Castile soap with other natural ingredients. No harmful foaming agents. Only a few bar soaps are totally harmful chemical free, even of ones claiming to be natural.* There are some small bits of something like pumice in the soap that are pleasant and scrubbing but not harsh. It also has bath salts and mud built into the soap from the Dead Sea which I can't detect but may contribute to how well the soap works.* It sudses up well, rinses well, lasts a long time, and is pleasant to use. The large bar is easy to grip.All the one with nature soaps are great. The rose one has a great rose scent. The shea butter has lotion in it.It lasts longer and is more pleasant to use than the several ""castile bar"" soaps.South of France French Triple Milled Soap (made in the USA) I've purchased the 6-pack of 7-oz bars several times because this is my favorite bar soap. The lemon sage and lavender scents are great. There are absolutely no artificial offnotes at all in these soaps, they are nice hefty size (7 oz bars) and last a long time. The lemon sage smells mostly lemony and the lavender definitely smells like lavender essential oil. I store the unused bars in the linen closet, unwrapped, to gently add their fragrance to the closet.I love scented soap but not over-powering ones that use manmade fragrances. In the past, I've thrown away many ""natural"" lavender soaps ordered online that smelled nothing like natural lavender. This brand is the real deal. After trying lots of soaps, this one is the winner. It lasts a good long time, is fragrance-free, which I need, and moisturizing but not too much (not greasy). I will probably use this soap exclusively unless they stop making it. Highly recommend it, especially for people who are fragrance sensitive. very nice! Seems many reviews say this One With Nature bar soap leaves their skin soft and moisturized.. I can't say I agree with that.. This soap does lather up nicely and rinses off clean which is what I like, but I did notice my skin seemed to be drier and itchier than it normally is when I use Nubian Heritage bar soaps.. Big bar lasts a long time but I think this soap might be better suited for use in the summer rather than in the winter when you are exposed to heat and much dryer air.. I definitely need to use a moisturizer after using this soap.. Other than that this is not a bad bar soap. Lathers up very well and rinses clean but leaves my skin dryer than I'd like.. I like the exfoliating Dead Sea soaps. The scent is good, they last a reasonable length of time and, they leave me feeling clean and refreshed. no scent , moisturizing, and price I have had adult acne combined with eczema and dry skin for the last 20 years. I have used every product and medication (except Accutane) to help my condition. Many prodcuts made the acne worse and yet others irritated my face to the point of misery. I decided to research the best reviews of products and I came across this soap over 1 year ago. I have used nothing else since. For me, this product was a miracle.I have only had 2 cysts in a year and they resolved within 2 days without the normal course of pain and suffering. My small comedones have improved tremendously and my eczema is so much better on my body as well.I gave a bar to my sister and she said it dried her face too much but she uses it with a washcloth and scrubs her face too vigorously anyway. I warned her that the washcloth combination with the mild exfoliating grains within the soap may cause irritation but she just doesn't listen! I find that using this soap with just warm water and gentle massage with the hands works great to remove makeup and clean my face.I tried using another brand and my face broke out quickly and I went right back to this soap. I love this soap. I wish I had found it 20 years ago. I also loved the Almond Shea butter but I only use those for the body and not the face. I keep planning to try the other scents but every time I go to order, I just get the 6 pack of the Dead Sea Bar Soap.Try this soap, it has great reviews, lasts forever in the shower and works wonderfully! I love bar soaps.  And I think this is the best brand of soap.  It pretty much beats all other bars.  Long-lasting large 7 oz. bar.  Suds are soft, and plenteous.  Cleans great.  Absolutely not harsh.  Colors are great; I love the yellow, the pink.  Lots of flavors available; I love the almond, the shea butter.  A luxurious treat for your body and hair."
499,B000MGOZ30,"Most of my husband beard oils are too strong scented but he has been using this and it works great for making his beard soft and scent is very mild. ❤️ I got this because I have dry skin and love bleaching hair way too much. But, let's be honest, how else would I get such vibrant blues and purples? OK I digress, the point is, I was turning into a desert and have issues with textures. I can only use abut 3 lotions because the rest leave this greasy layer on my skin that feels like I'm suffocating in wax. Even those lotions I can only use at night because my job requires me to be lotion free. I decided to try this because technically it's food, so I can use it before work.First I tried it on my hair. I have naturally coarse hair that has also been bleached and dyed. So, to start with, the I have the perfect shampoo, so I get very little color fade, but that very little became almost none because of how well this is protecting my hair. But I also noticed that my hair was much softer and less prone to tangles. It took me 1 or 2 tries to get the amount down, a little goes a long way, but as long as you don't just drench your hair, it's not oily or heavy.Next I decided that since it's an oil, an after shower oil was the way to go. I used a dime size amount for both arms, then that much for each leg, and I'm softer than any lotion has ever made me. Bonus, my feet have stopped itching. The dry skin itch was keeping me up at night, but this has fixed that. I've started using it on my husband's elbows, and he almost has human elbows again.Then I thought, well, let's try it as hand lotion. So I put 3 drops on the top of each hand, and spread a drop around my cuticles, then rubbed. I was so happy with how well it absorbs in to dry skin without leaving a residue that I even took it to work to share with co-workers because we can't use lotion, but washing your hands 20+ times a day in between staying covered in desiccating corn meal was causing a few of them to have irritation and even micro fissures in their hands. 1 day and poof, everyone was better (or at least obviously improved). I just can't say enough good things about this stuff. Affordable.... I've never diluted essential oils, but thought I'd try it since life is so expensive today.Haven't tried it yet, but will update. I do use Avocado oil as moisturizer for hands, as they are in water all day, washing, as a nurse and caregiver for disabled teen and my pets.Will update on mixing with essential oils as I was told to do. Does look rather small, so if it's successful, will look for much larger size.PS..good for dry colored hair, skin moisturizer, and for all over skin care. Nice light moisturizing oil for your hair Love using this instead of lotion Best moisturizer ever. I use it on my hair as a pre poo, as well as under my eyes and on my lips along with sweet almond oil. BEST combo ever for me.I mix 1 drop of this with 1 drop of almond oil and apply nightly under my eyes, my lashes, my eye brows and my lips. In a couple weeks my dark circles have lightened up a bit (its hereditary, so they will never go away completely), and the puffiness under my eyes have completely vanished. I don't have any issues with lines so I can't speak to that. But now i use the tiniest bit of concealer and my dark under eyes are completely concealed.My lashes and eyebrows have also filled in and are much thicker. My lips are a bit dark and during the fall/winter season they are exceptionally dry and crack, but using this on my lips have made them nice, moisturized, and have over all improved the color of my lips. I don't even feel like covering my lips with lipstick or lip gloss. I use only sheer colored lip products now :)Sometimes when my skin feels a bit dry, i apply a couple drops to my whole face alone, or along with my vitamin c serum. Has not caused any issues for my acne prone skin, and i love how this oil sinks in immediately to your skin, and doesn't leave a sheen. Boyfriend uses this on his beard and loves it.Highly recommend. Even with heavy use, the 4 oz. bottle will last a VERY long time (unless you use to cook, then you would need more).I do recommend transferring a small amount of the oil into a glass bottle with an eye dropper. Makes it easier to use. The rest I refrigerate to prolong shelf life (aprx. 1 year to 1.5 years). The price for each bottle doesn’t equal the value of the product"
500,B000YA3HVK,"I used this for quite a while then started trying other products out of curiosity. I fell in love with Fake Bake  Darker but the cost has become a bit ridiculous for what it does. Luckily I saved a half-used container of this from a few years ago and decided on a whim to try it again. I guess I had forgotten how long it lasts compared to Fake Bake, and how much easier it is to apply. I use a mitt and gloves as I did with Fake Bake,  rather than just using my hands, and it worked quite well.I have fair skin and have found that the Deep is perfect for me. It doesn't give me an orange tint as others tend to do. The only thing I wish they would change is the sparkling - not a fan of that but it's a minor point, as that comes off after the first shower.I've been at this self-tanning routine since 1989 so I've tried many different forms - lotions, sprays, mousses, gels, etc. - and I believe this is the best. Spray tanners are okay if you use the gloves and mitt, but you have to be careful not to inhale it, especially if you use it a lot. Dollar for dollar this stuff is a much better deal - less expensive, lasts longer. No contest. Bye bye, higher priced Fake Bake! *UPDATE* I've been using this for about 3 weeks and still like it, however, there is one thing to mention if you wear contacts: the glitter in this will sometimes get in your eyes. Anyone who wears contacts knows what it feels like to get anything else in your eye. I got too confident applying this and started using a beauty blender all the time. I never get near my eyes with it but I apparently got some in my eyebrows. Some of the glitter got into my eye and that was not fun. I need to find some product without the glitter.As a black woman with dark skin, I have been using a ""glow"" product for a couple of years and like the effect but wanted something that gives more color because as I get older, my color is fading and getting uneven. This one is working without breaking out my sometimes-sensitive skin. Here are the highlights:- Glitter??? Doesn't have as much ""glitter"" as I feared from reading some reviews. I am dark so, trust me, glitter would really sparkle. I can see the glitter faintly on the back of my hand after first applying this. On my face, I didn't notice as much. When I wash my face before bed, the color stays and the glitter goes.- Itch??? I was really worried about this because I recently tried a tester of another product and had to immediately get it off my skin. This one tingled slightly the first time I applied it but the tingle didn't get bad and it went away as the product dried. And, keep in mind, I am using this on my face. After that first time, I haven't even felt even the slightest tingle.-Drying out skin??? The product I used in the past was a lotion for wet skin and I didn't want to use anything else that would dry out my skin. This doesn't dry me out but I do make sure to apply my regular moist lotion in-between applications. So far, so good.- Smell??? Sniffing the open cap, there is a faint, soapy kind of scent. It's not unpleasant and I didn't smell it when the test spot dried on the back of my hand.- Sticky??? Yes. While this is still damp on the skin, it has a tacky-like feel. Once it dries, it's okay. Thankfully.-Shiny??? OMGoodness, yes! I almost hated this because of the shine the first day. What I realized is that I can wipe down to get rid of the shine and when I wash my face at night/morning the shine goes away. I am going to start applying this at bedtime so that I can wash it off in the morning. That will get rid of both any hint of glitter and the shine.-Transfer??? I didn't have any problems with this getting on paperwork or my clothes - as long as I let it dry completely. What I love about this over makeup is that I don't have to deal with transfer to my clothes and paperwork and furniture, etc. When you wear dark makeup, transfer can be a big problem.- On my hair??? I was careful not to get this into my hairline the first day and I made sure to wipe my brows with a damp tissue and brush my lashes too. After the first day, I forgot. I haven't had any problems with the product messing with the color of my hair. That might be because I have black hair though. Someone with lighter hair/lighter skin might want to be more careful. I read a review that warned about orange hair...-Results??? The photos are from Day 1 and 3. I was worried that I wasn't going to get the color I wanted but it really does take applying this for a few days to start noticing effects on my dark complexion.- Concerns??? I see on the bottle a suggestion to use within 6 months but there is no expiration date on the tube. I probably won't be throwing this out if I have some left!I can tell you about this or I can show you so 2 of the photos you are seeing are not enhanced. I wanted to show what my skin looks like with the fresh application of the bronzer on Day 1 and Day 3.Basically, this is a great way for me to enhance my natural color and not irritate my good-but-aging 59-year old skin. I will now only wear foundation for special occasions because this is perfect for that ""bare-faced"" look. I might at some point try some of the pricier tanning ""oils"" for black skin but this works and I will probably be keeping some of it around for a while.I also have noticed that you can't combine this with most moisturizers because it will pill and roll off. You can use a good moisturizer once it has completely dried - even those with oils in them. And you will need it because this not only dries out the skin but keeps drying it out so you have to reapply your moisturizer whenever you feel the dryness. Updated Note Mar 2022Once applied, the tan will last daily shower 10-12 days. Do not rub towel when drying yourself after a shower.I applied the tan a second time and it worked like a charm.This tan does have an orange tinge on beige colored skin :)---If youre just getting your feet wet, this tanning lotion turned out safe, easy - it does work. I am beige/fair and used Medium. This is the first time I was tanning and super scared of skin reactions. I did considerable research for 3.5 months.My experience using this product is A+. I am happy with my first choice!My tips for using Loreal's sublime bronzer lotion- Watch Youtube tutorials on what to do before tanning (exfoliate, shave and moisturize all your skin)- Watch Yourtube tutorials on how to apply - I recommend investing in a Mitt instead of using your hands. I bought the Steugo Mitt- I did not use this product on my face.- I highly recommend you moisturize all areas 4 hours after first application and specially the new few days.Heads up- The tanning lotion has a very strong scent. It did not cause any issues for me but it stayed on me and in my bathroom until I showered. I wore my low maintenance clothing during the drying period and full clothes as a precaution to avoid getting any color on my bed.- The recommendation is to use for 2-3 days. I have only used it once and have the intended bronzing effect with 1 use. I will re-apply in a few weeks.- My feet look orange (not a desirable shade) so I guess I'll just overlook that :)- I did get existing white spots show up stark against my new tan. So will need to apply concealer on those :)Go for it- As a first time tanner, I was super apprehensive and did months of research. However having invested / wasted a ton of money with dermatologists in the last 6 years, I decided to camouflage my skin's spots with tanning - ladies, Im so happy I did that. This is an easy application process, just be patient and go for it."
501,B001ECQ51G,"The fragrance is pleasant but what you'll love about this product is its moisturizing components.  It makes your skin feel soft & smooth.  Some may find it a little too oily, but that's remedied by wiping away the excess.  I happen to love it for my veery dry skin! Love this item try it the first time last summer and I really liked it couldn't find it in any stores and amazingly I went on Amazon and got three bottles for a very great price I am very happy with my product Great product Moisturizing, mild scent, value fornyour money. Great value This is a good product according to my wife.  Arrived on time. It’s a nice shiny moisturizer for the legs, I find the scent of manufactured cocoa butter a bit strong but you might like it! I use it every night and it seems to moisturize well It's...fine. I use it to shave my legs which isn't really its intended use so take this review with a grain of salt as a lot of my gripes are specific to that context.For shaving: do not use. Clogs the heck out of my razor, is almost impossible to completely clear the blades to the point where it's probably better to just switch out the heads every time I shave (costly and annoying). It leaves a residue/buildup all over the shower, which I do expect cuz it's a gel oil, but this is like childbirth to me. It's a huge pain and every time I do it again I wonder how I forgot how much a pain it is. Also isn't really all that effective. I had better results about a year ago with the same product so maybe it's a weird batch or the recipe changed, but the consistency is so thick that it takes maybe 2 passes (over mostly stubble btw) before it's clogged and I still have to go over it again, clogging it a 2nd time for the same area. Repeat ad nauseum.For typical use: personally, not a fan of the smell. I like cocoa butter, like the way it smells, but this smells sickly sweet. It's not all that moisturizing and takes forever to absorb if it does at all and you just end up with a sticky, saccharine smelling coating that just feels gross. Admittedly my body does weird nonsense and my skin is more sensitive than average but this feels absurd, I started breaking out in cystic acne that just will not go away in some very uncomfortable places. Mostly along the sides of and between the girls, but also my shoulders and back and some other VERY uncomfortable places. Tbh I missed my return window and I'm probably gonna toss the bottles I have left into my give away bin (if you have bath/beauty/hygeine products that are open you can't return, check for local food banks, they distribute that to the homeless and those are the most under-donated items that people tend to overlook but they are absolutely needs).TLDR: you will probably be fine if you don't have sensitive skin and don't use it to shave and don't mind how, imo, overly sweet it smells. Otherwise don't bother. I admit that I didn't use it for its intended purpose but it still missed the mark in every way even considering that for me."
502,B000QXGBOU,"Lightweight lotion, like not having anything on your face wonderful Makes my face smooth and not greasy. It’s makes me very moist not dry at all. Perfect for everyone skin. the product is great. took forever to receive the package I first got this product when I was in high school. I've been using it ever since. If you're like me and you have combination skin, this product is perfect. It moisturizes without feeling like theres a barrier on your skin and sinks in immediately. My skin is always obviously hydrated to the touch when I use it. It's non-greasy, non-oily, and leaves no residue. It's easily one of my favorite skin care products of all time. On my face to keep my skin soft I love this product I’ve been using it for years keeps my face moisturizer and feeling beautiful The moisturizer is so good, but it received the bottle not complete till the top of the bottle (almost 1st quarter of the bottle is empty). That made me sad because the moisturizer was not cheap My mom has been using this for quite sometime, along with other Clinique products. It’s a great moisturizer, doesn’t leave her skin greasy, and no bad oder (otherwise she’d toss it)."
503,B000PKZG22,"Dermalogica multi vitamin power firm for under eye bags softens the appearance of eye bags.  I am 65 years old and my under eye care is not for severe bags, but when I see them in the morning, this product does the trick!  I highly recommend it. I’m in my late 20s and was starting to develop fine lines around my eyes. I already noticed a different using it once a day for 2 weeks. It hasn’t done much for my deep lines but that’s to be expected I really was just targeting the fine lines. I’m not thrilled with the price but it works well and lasts a long time so I can’t complain This eye cream is very good. It is expensive, but it lasts a long time and I feel it works so well that it is worth it. Great cream for my eyes I used this product for a couple months before I wrote a review. I was unfortunately disappointed as I’m not seeing any results after starting off usually once daily and then 2x daily. I’ve been using other Dermalogica products for a couple years (Active Moist) and happy with that so had high hopes for this Power Firm. I’m 30 and have fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes and was hoping to reduce the look of them, but this hasn’t helped in the slightest. The description says “helps combat lines around the delicate eye area” so I understand not get rid of, but was hoping for some type of reducing. Everyone’s skin is different so I will say it’s possible it’ll work for someone else, but definitely not for me so it was let down especially paying $70+. On the pro side it’s moisturizing, a little goes a long way and it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. More expensive, but I plan on trying a Jan Marini wrinkle/aging cream instead. I have been using this for years and am happy with it. I do alternate my eye products. Helps with bags under my eyes! Been using it for several months see great improvement Very moisturizing. It really does help with the fine lines. Only need a little goes along ways. It’s one of the best eye creams around, I’ve tried so many others because of the cost, but I go right back to it! I have been using this product for many years!"
504,B001B4SEY8,"Been using lye soap for years, good for my skin. Worked wonders for my granddaughter If you have sensitive skin like me, this soap helps to balance skin.  Skin can become too oily or too dry, but this lye soap seems to help establish the correct conditions for balance and smoother, healthier skin.It also seems to combat the effects of chigger bites. Ingredients:  Food grade lard, lye, water.Smell:  It just smells like unscented soap.  Much like Ivory or Neutrogena bar soap.  It doesn't smell ""porky"" or ""lardy"" to me at all.  The smell is a bit strong if you're sniffing the bar, but once you rinse it off your skin, it doesn't leave much of any smell at all on your body.Shape:  It is a large bar of soap, with squared edges.  So it's kind of hard to hold it, and use it when you first get it.  But after a few days it rounds out a bit, and is fine.Lather:  It lathers up bit, but not very much.  So don't be disappointed if you don't get a rich, thick lather from it.Body soap:  It absolutely gets you clean, and scent free.  But it leaves a scummy residue behind on your body, even if you rinse well, leaving your skin kind of sticky feeling, exactly like Ivory, or Dial, or Irish Springs bars of soap do.  I prefer Dove bar soap, or a liquid soap to wash my body with, since they don't leave me feeling sticky after I get out of the shower.Shampoo:  If you run out of shampoo and conditioner, you *can* use this instead.  It will get your hair clean, and allow you to run a comb through it afterwards.  BUT... this is not exactly preferable.  Your hair will *not* be as soft, shiny, and silky as it would be with a good shampoo and conditioner.  However, if you have short hair, it will leave your hair with lots of body and texture, and super easy to style.Hand soap:  I can't get over how soft my hands are.  I wash my hands a LOT during the day, and I've always used a bit of fragrance-free Curel lotion, after washing them.  Now, even without the lotion, my hands feel incredibly soft.Rashes:  I've had a rash on my wrist for several months now, from my watch.  I've tried everything to get rid of it.  Stopped wearing the watch, tried anti-fungal cream, neosporin, topical steroid cream.  Within two days of using the soap, the rash started going away.  I kind of think it must be coincidence.  I don't know how a product that doesn't have anything in it except lard and lye could clear up a rash.  But it is a bit amazing.  If I get any more rashes, I'll try the soap on it again, and see if it works again.Face soap:  I've found the holy grail of face soaps.  I will never use any other soap on my face.  I had great skin up until my mid 20's when all of a sudden, each pore grew to the size of Texas, and each pore was just filled with dirt and oil.  I couldn't get rid of it.  No matter how many times a day I washed my face, or what kind of soap I used, nothing helped.  The only thing that helped at all was the sulfur mask, by Proactive, but if I used that very often, it dried my skin out really bad.  My skin was both too dry AND too oily, all at the same time.  Flaky areas, surrounded by oil patches.  Did I mention the hundreds of black-heads, white-heads, and the occasional zit the size of Mt. Everest?  So for the last 10 years or so, I've had to live with this embarrassing skin.The first time I washed my face with Grandma's Lye Soap, I noticed my pores looked smaller, and my face felt very soft.  By day two of using it, I noticed a reduction of blackheads, and the few zits I had on my face were going away, and no new ones were appearing.  By day three, I was completely hooked on this soap.  My skin hasn't looked this good since before I hit puberty.  The dry flaky areas are completely gone.  The oil patches are still there, but much reduced.  The blackheads, whiteheads, and zits are almost completely gone.  My pores look much smaller and tighter.  I am using some Clinique face lotion, after I wash my face, but that is it.  I am so astonished... I can't get over how great my skin looks, and my skin is as soft as a baby's bottom!UPDATE:  I've been using this soap on my face for several months now, and I still love it.  However, my face did start drying out from it pretty bad.  Getting rid of the acne was worth it to me though.  So now, after I use the soap, I use a tiny bit of oil on my face (olive oil or almond oil) instead of lotion.  My skin looks fantastic. It is what it is lye soap great product When I was a child, I use to hear how the grandparents made their own soap. I also, will remember my grandparents as hard-working people. This is not the case in the world we live in. It seems everyone is too lazy to make their own soap. I know I am too lazy to do this. Here I am over forty years old and just when I thought I was over puberty; I was smacked in the face with what looked like the largest boils I ever seen. These suckers were out of this world. I didn't even have these when I was a teenager spraying the hair spray of the 80's in my hair and all over my forehead because I didn't have enough since to cover my forehead with my hand to keep the hairspray off my forehead.  So, here I was in my forties and hosting my daughters baby shower when this older lady had pointed out this acne on my face. She explained, she knew an old remedy to get rid of this acne fast. She recommended Lye soap. Well as intrigued as I always was about this homemade soap this finally gave me the perfect reason to pay almost three times the price, I usually pay for a bar of soap. I was excited when it came in and had to try it. I opened this bar of soap that was the squarest design of soap I ever seen. It was odd as to how long it would take to lather and get on my hands. Although, I am sure this bar of soap was not made in someone’s back yard it has all the real ingredients. This soap will leave your skin dry. I do not recommend using this on your body because of the dryness but it was very effective in helping my boils on my face. I think it is where it is so dry. After a few weeks washing my face with this my boils disappeared, and I felt youthful all over again. I have purchased this many times since and will only use this on my face. It has no fragrance to it so I do not think it will make anyone have an allergic reaction. I think everyone should try this. Wasn't sure about this soap but heard someone rave about it on a podcast. I love the scent and it lathers up great. Very gentle and makes my skin soft. Who would have thought that from lye??? :)"
505,B000B9N0N4,"We've been using Mary Kay products for a year now and my wife and I are pretty satisfied. I have an oily face and this product does exactly what I need and to the point, without skinning my face off. It also helps to prevent new black spot and does not leave a very dry and irritating sensation. The difficulty is to get some of these products exported to Brazil, but that's something else... I've used the Proactive toner in the past, but stopped after a while since I didnt notice any difference in my skin besides it being a little more dried out than before. I bought this Mary Kay Formula 3 toner about a week ago and have been using it for the past few days and already notice a great difference in my skin! I have extremely sensitive, combination type skin that breaks out with acne very easily. I decided to give this toner a try (after a beauty consultant recommendation to use a toner in my daily skin care regimen) and am so happy that I did. I wash my face every night before bed and assumed that it was clean, but after using this toner and seeing what was still left over on my cotton pads after washing my face, I was kind of disgusted. It gets off all the small dirt and makeup particals that I left behind after washing my face. I love it and have already noticed fewer blemishes on my skin (which I haven't thought possible for a very long time) I'm almost through my first bottle and my skin has certainly cleared up. The only thing is that I'm not sure if it's this formula, or if any other toner might work the same way. I'm not willing to find out, though, and just bought my second bottle! I love this product. I have never been completely sold on Mary Kay products but this I will continue to buy in the future. I'm 21 years old and from time to time I have problems with acne and blemishes. Since I have been using this product my face has been problem free. I've been using it for almost 2 months now and for me that is un heard of. When I noticed that I was getting a large bump I made sure I applied it to my face and even held it there for about a minute just to make sure it wouldn't get any bigger. It burned for about a minute or so afterwards but when I woke up a few hours later the bump had actually shrank and was gone within 24 hours. I have never had a product that worked so well. I love this product and its a must have for even adults with the occasional acne. I had stopped using the blemish control toner for about a year and in during that time I tried other ways to deal with my blemishes.  I couldn't get them under control and returned to this product.  My skin has cleared up. The #3 MK Blemish Control Toner is one of the better astringent products on the market - and reasonably priced! It contains 2% salicylic acid that penetrates the external layer of the skin and reduces the appearance of pores. Another added bonus is it gradually fades blemish hyper pigmentation scars and other discolorations or unevenness. After about 2 weeks of consistent use you will see your skin's appearance begin to improve.I have been a faithful MK user (off and on) for the last 15 years. The reason I always return to MK is the quality of the products, and buying them through Amazon at a discounted rate is nice! I bought this product on a whim. I have been using the Formula 3 face wash and it seemed to be working. This is the first toner I have ever had that actually worked for me. It helped keep what acne I do get away and it helped clear up the acne I already had. I'm 22 and this has really done great on my skin. One bottle usually last me around 2 months so its not rough on the pockets. Great product. Keep it up Mary Kay. I have to go back to my original routine and original toner but it may work diff for some people"
506,B001ECQ3YU,"I really like eo brand. This company is pricey and see them at market for a bit less. I like the lotion and it smells good. Perfumed lotions make me really sick because of all the chemicals in them but because this lotion is scented with essential oils so that doesn’t happen. The only thing I am always disappointed about with Amazon (and not necessarily their fault) is that the delivery drivers can take the time to take a picture to cover themselves and prove they’ve  delivered but they’re too lazy to take a second to extend their arm to ring the bell so we know something has been put on our porch. My husband is ALWAYS home and will come to the door when the bell is rung but if no one rings the bell and my husband doesn’t hear the driver outside, what good is a lousy picture going to do for us if the box is stolen off our porch?! Delivery people always used to ring the doorbell to alert us that a package had been put in our porch. What has happened to a little common courtesy? Like I said, it takes one second after taking their picture to extend their arm to ring a doorbell before they leave. Why so lazy?! I loved this lotion and believe it or not so did my husband!  He doesn't like flower type lotions, but this was just a nice mildly scented product.  It was nice and light and not too thick.  Often I get lotions and they are either runny or too thick.  This lotion was just right.  My husband wanted me to buy an additional 3 bottles after he tried this lotion!I also worry as I have sensitive skin, but I had no problems using this lotion. My skin gets so dry in the winter.  My hands actually crack.  This helped moisturize my dry skin, but did not feel my skin sticky like a lot of other products do.“This product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail price. I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers. I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.” The best brand ever. I’ve had it in my home for years, after experiencing it at a fancy boutique restaurant in San Francisco. Clean, natural scent. I would probably have a better review of this product but two out of the three bottles the pump would not work, so I have been using it less since it is a hassle to unscrew the bottle every time I need some lotion. I wish they would have worked as I wanted to love this product. This stuff is amazing.  I have a skin condition that is so severe that prescription cortisone wasn't working,  compounded creams didn't work and the only relief albeit gross was complete occlusion.  I had no skin,  and if I moved I bled.  My fingers would get infected and my bones would hurt.  My nails were falling out.  I bought this cream originally at a discount grocer.  And it HEALED me.  I'm a customer forever.  I have skin again,  although scarred,  cuticles and my nails are healthy again.  I wish they marketed this item for severe skin conditions because it could help so many people.  Love,  love,  love!  Worth every penny This cream absorbs pretty quickly and has a lovely lavender aroma. Gave it 4 stars because a product has to really go above and beyond to blow my mind and earn a 5. This is a solid 4. I ordered one for my desk at the office and one for home, for after showering and am enjoying it.One thing that is annoying, however, is the that the pump of my bottles all generate lotion coming out of the sides, not just through the top nozzle. Maybe the cream dries up between uses and clogs the stem of the pump, but beware; it can be messy. Nice, lavender smelling lotion that works well for a massage lotion, although you have to reapply more frequently than some I have used.  It goes on well, and doesn't feel greasy at all.  It absorbs quickly.  My husband and I rub each others feet at night while we watch our tv programs, and over the years we have tried many different lotions and oils. This one certainly ranks high, but because of the frequent applications, the product goes fast. We purchased a three pack for just over $23 about 18 days ago, and are already nearly through our second bottle.I think this product would also be an ideal body lotion after showering. If you love the smell of lavender, you should love it. it's nicely fragrant."
507,B001DXQMS2,"Now, I have been using this product for around four weeks and I can honestly say that it performs the same as some creams that cost upward of $250 dollars. There is a small thing you have to remember when using this cream and that is that you have to keep using it to retain the results! I have been guilty of discontinuing use for a day or two because I was ""just too tired"" to go through with my normal regimen and I noticed the difference immediately. While using the Ageless future serum I noticed an immediate softening and fullness in the one present small lines I have on my 34 yr old face. My husband also noticed the positive difference in my skin immediately.The one thing that keeps me from writing a five star review is the fact that this product contains UREA! Yes, I know most cosmetics use the synthetic form of UREA. However that knowledge doesn't keep me from being a little queasy that I'm putting the synthetic properties of urine on my face. Also most cosmetic research agencies indicate that UREA can cause inflammation. So if you are sensitive you may want to try this at the mall without buying to find out if you will be sensitive.Overall I like it and it makes my skin feel great! A little of this mighty serum works wonders.  I have found that this serum really potentiates the effects of the moisturizers either daytime or nighttime.  As with many skin care regimes there are advantages of using entire product lines to get the best results.  I don't feel I have to use this daily, but every 2 or 3rd day is sufficient.  The mositurizing bars that come with the hydration creams really prepare the skin to accept the mositurizers.  I find that this serum improves my skin quality if I have spent more time outside in our dry Colorado air.  This is a definite ""must have"" when caring for one's skin. I can't believe the difference in my skin around the eyes, I barely have any wrinkles but the little bit I do have is reduced to almost nothing. Don't wait until you have wrinkles, help prevent them from forming in the first place and this serum is wonderful. First I use the Obey Your Body Dead Sea Facial Peeling Gel to remove the dead skin cells and then the Ageless Future  Cell-Renewal, the absorption is immediate and within minutes the lines almost disappear. On days that I do not use it my eyes still look better than they used to. As a psoriasis sufferer, keeping my skin hydrated and silky smooth is a difficult task at best.The best product that I ever used was Essence of Time [made from peat moss] but alas they have stopped marketing it. I tried this product for about a month and I give it 3 stars. It does hydrate the skin and so far I have not realized any bad side effects. If they ever putEssence of Time back on the market I will be on it like white on rice! I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  I have side by side the ones I purchased from the mall and the ones I purchased from Amazon.  They are identical.  One difference is the ones from Amazon at 70-90% discount from the mall.  What not to love about the products.  Ladies with mature skin, try them.  Serum and cream work well together.  Your skin will thank you. Hidrata y mantiene la piel hidrata desde el primer uso Bought this product previously from a rep at a trade show. The o ly thing I didn't like was the price so I found it on your site and ordered it. Loved it  It did not appear to be tampered with This works great and sinks into the skin immediately. It is not greasy feeling, and it works well. I like the way it feels when I put it on my face. It's a great product!"
508,B0002BPIZO,"I always have loved this scent. It lasts for a long time and you smell so clean!!!!!! I’ve loved and used this particular Philosophy fragrance for years because it’s simple and fresh and doesn’t smell like a “loud” perfume. It’s very convenient for me to get it on Amazon and I’ll continue to buy it here. I get many compliments  when I wear it. When I wear pure Grace I receive so many compliments, I just love it This smells so good but the scent doesn’t last. Disappointing for a perfume that’s not that cheap THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENTS, EVER!FRESH, DELIGHTFUL, WONDERFULLY PLEASANT AND APPEALING.WORTH EVERY PENNY AND THEN SOME. Simply amazing fragrance TikTok lead me here and I am not super impressed. It has a clean but old lady smell to it. To me, perfume is a luxury b/c it’s all overpriced. This one is a great, simple, clean scent."
509,B000NNCA16,"I've been using this hair oil for a few years. It's light and seems to help with dryness. However this last time the wrapping around the bottle had leakage. I sent it back and the second bottle had the same thing happen. Not sure if it's a packaging problem but may be best just to buy from the beauty supply store. I love this , but have to keep it in the refrigerator or it will smell like old, stale cooking oil after a while.I have been buying this for years and tossing out 1/2 the bottle.For this reason I am taking a break and using another brand by Influ...for a while to compare . I love this product because it leaves the hair soft, but doesn't weigh it down. I’ve been purchasing this hair oil for yearsLove that it is available on AmazonThank you to the supplier who got this hair oil to meI will purchase from you againIt’s a great moisturizer for hairReduces hair breakageOnly need a drop or two This product works well as my hair gets dry easily.  It’s also easy to apply. This oil is almost like the oil that your scalp naturally produces. Works great. I use it on my 6 year old daughter’s hair as well. Oil is light weight and gives the hair a nice shine without it being greasy This is a great hair product!! Very light!!"
510,B000NKL3D0,"I love this lotion. I have been using it a few years. It keeps my hands soft and don't have a strong smell. This cream works so good on my dry skin and it is not greasy. I use this every night on my feet, it does help my skin, however for an all over moisturizer I use Eveeno. This is my favorite lotion and this size was perfect for traveling. Great item.  Now way too expensive Best lotion for winter weather and dry skin. Works excellently. Good value. I’ve been using this product for a long time now. Best part is that there is no scent, but it’s good at  moisturizing and dries fairly quickly."
511,B001ET78L0,"I've used this product before a few years ago.  Glad to find it again.  Non-greasy so it doesn't get on clothes or fabric if you're a quilter or cross stitcher. My favorite hand cream! I will never switch. It moisturizes and isn't greasy. No noticeable scent either, so it doesn't compete with my perfume. I have jars everywhere in my home, car, and at work. I love this product, I use it daily on my whole body, non-greasy and light fragrance. Definitely Affordable! Love this product because it helps my dry skin and it does not cause issues with my skin sensitivities. I have used it for over many years.  Only issue is 3 of the 6 containers had the bottoms broke/cracked open upon transit/delivery. I use it for cycling.  Cycling chamois lube is crazy expensive.  This works just as well for MUCH less.  Great product! Satisfied with product We've been using this nightly on my 3 year olds eczema and it makes his skin so soft and smooth. I've been using things stuff since the 90s. Great lotion and it absorbs super fast compared to most others I've tried. Gloves in a Bottle is the only other stuff that comes close, but that's got its specific use while this is a good all over lotion. Doesn't really have much of a scent, which is fine with me."

513,B000052YMG,"This product is great for washing face.  Doesnt dry out skin My dermatologist recommended that I use this product years ago for my delicate skin.  I love it and try not to be without it. Great LOVE PRODUCT AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 25 YRS [i'm 71 yrs old] AND PEOPLE THINK I'M MUCH YOUNGER THA  AM. I have lichen sclerosus. If you have this disease you know how painful it is. This is very soothing and simple to use. I don’t smell any scent. Would highly recommend Live the way it leaves my skin after washing my face. No redness, itching or drying out of my skin. Great on sensitive skin, the best!!!!!!!! Facial wash"
514,B001F51TGI,"I’ve used this product for years on my skin and it works very well. I have been using this product for several years.  It is a great moisturizer and does not irritate my sensitive skin. This product was recommended by my dermatologist many years ago.  I have used it ever since.  I have been very pleased with it. I bought it for my sister, and she loves it. Sun protection for sensitive skin. I bought this in July and it expires in October, so let the buyer beware!  Still, I've been using this exclusively for years; my face loves it.  If I misplace a jar and find it a year later, it does smell a bit off.I went on this whole journey of skincare discovery in 2019 and tried a ton of expensive stuff.  I came right back to this.  There are a (very) few products that feel even nicer, but they either have a scent that sets off my allergies, or they're $60 for the same quantity. I was looking for something for sensitive skin because I have really sensitive skin and I came across this it goes on kind of lightly but it kind of stung my face I have been using this product for years and love it.  I have even bought it multiple times via Amazon as I travel a lot and buying the 3 is perfect due to their size and I can keep one in my travel case and use the other 2.  However this time they arrived in July and expire in October as well as arrived with no box or tamperproof seal.  As this is the first time I saw they were shipped from Canada I sent a note to the supplier but no response.  Concerned so will be returning and reordering, hoping that I will be able to continue to order this way as it has been very convenient with no issues in the past"
515,B000R94OGK,"Only been using this about 5 days and already can feel the difference. In morning I place it on my face after Cellex Professional Serum.  Only one drawback, when using dropper, there is a possibility that too much is dropping into my palm because after rubbing it into my skin, takes awhile for all of it to absorb in my skin.  Or maybe I'm not waiting long enough in between applying Professional Serum and this B Complex.  Going to try using this alone at night before retiring to see if there is an appreciable difference.  I'll figure it out ;o).  Love this product though!UPDATE::  Been using for a month and this solution is exceptional. Skin feels smoother, tighter and clarity of tone is amazing.  Keep in mind I use it after applying Professional Serum.  Im thinking together or alone, they both are excellent.  Was using Professional Serum, then applying a moisturizer before I purchased this and my skin felt soft, with enhanced clarity and reduced pores.  Truly love Cellex C ;o) Love this stuff.  This serum is a part of my daily routine; I use it beneath my primer and tinted moisturizer.  It really hydrates and plumps your skin.  I've been using it for about 10 years now and recently have combined it with Ole Henricksen's Truth Serum.  One drop is all you need to slather your whole face.  On days when I don't feel like wearing makeup, I'll put this on followed by a light creamy moisturizer.  I'm a bit older, so if you're younger, you probably wouldn't need the extra moisturizer on top.  When used alone, your skin feels like you put egg white on it - it feels tighter. .  Oh and I have rosacea.  It's also soothing and never burns your skin - great if you've overdone it with other products.  And since its mostly hyaluronic acid without any oils, it's great for those who have a tendency to break out. Makes my skin feel hydrated!  It’s expensive but worth it. It’s been part of my skin care regime for years. (This is from Jerry's wife).  I was given my first bottle of Cellix-C Hydra 5B. I found it made my senior skin feel firmer and look better. I don't have many wrinkles, so I'm not sure what it would do in that case. I liked it so well that I went online to search for it. I don't usually pay so much for my skin care products, and Cellex-C cost more than I'd usually pay, but I like it so much I searched until I found Amazon's more reasonable price, and purchased this, my second, bottle. A little goes a long way. I wipe the backs of my hands with what's left over after applying it to my face. I've used this for about a month now along with the Cellex skin tightening cream, not sure if its my imagination but I do feel my skin feels more refreshed & firmer, I've noticed in photos I don't look so tired, so I would recommend it to my ""more mature"" ladies out there who have been looking for something that works, it is definitely worth the extra $'s in my opinion, I am 51 yrs. young. I added this serum to my daily skin care regimen and it made an immediate, visible difference.  Combined with a good quality moisturizer, this serum has prevented me from looking my age.  I love the compliments from people who say I don't look my age. I credit this stuff.  Its much more expensive elsewhere so I am psyched to find it on Amazon at a significant discount. More effective than skin ceuticles which could be better at marketing. Between the two this can truly moisturizer and for me gets rid of very fine wrinkles. I've been using this for 10+ years and I've tried skin ceuticles, is oz vitamin c oil, environ, this is by far most effective. Works even better with dr. Weil mega mushroom serum but I think they are no longer making that. I return to this time and time again. Tried the cheaper pure hyaluronic acids out there but I always return to this because of the vitamin b that's part of the ingredients. I find that the included vitamin b helps my acne heal faster. So to me, the extra price is worth it."
516,B000MAOWOS,"I discovered MyChelle Products after trying tons of drugstore, ""designer"", and natural skin care lines.  MyChelle blows everything I've ever tried out of the water.I am just shy of 40 and my skin is normal to dry.  I've never had what I would characterize as ""problem"" skin but I have struggled at times with areas of dryness and enlarged pores.  Since I started using MyChelle a year ago, my skin just seems content.  No dryness.  A *big* reduction in lines and wrinkles.  Smaller pores.  And the biggest change is that I constantly have people telling me that my skin just GLOWS.  I literally have people come over to me and randomly comment on my skin - which NEVER happened to me before.  People have also started guessing that I'm a decade younger than I am - something else that never happened to me before using the MyChelle line.The Pumpkin Peel comes in a modest sized 1.2oz jar but as you just need the tiniest amount will last a very long time.  The product smell is yummy - like spiced pumpkin pie.  I do experience a little tingling when it is on my face but in a good, refreshing way.  After leaving it on for a few minutes and rinsing off, my face is smooth and soft, never dry.If you are looking for a natural skin care line - I can't recommend MyChelle enough.  It has done wonders for my skin and I love every single item I have tried.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this wonderful, quality product! Mychelle products are awesome and this peel is great. I feel so clean after using it and my face is very soft. I leave it on for 15 minutes or so but that is because I'm used to very strong peels. The only downfall is the size. It does last because a little goes a long way but I feel like I don't use it as often as I would like due to the size for the price. I was a little apprehensive before trying this peel, as I have very sensitive skin (redhead). I'm 27 with mostly ""normal"" skin. In southern climates it's more oily; I live in the PA now so it's more dry and dull looking. If I have an acne breakout, it's on my chin or lower cheeks. That said, I usually don't like pumpkin smells, but this one didn't bother me. The container is very small--a little of this product goes a long way! I noticed definite tingling within a few moments of applying it, but didn't mind leaving it on for the recommended 5 minutes. After rinsing it off, my skin was slightly pinkish red and felt cleaner and glowed. I used it at night and the next morning I noticed a marked improvement in the two breakout spots I had with no redness or dry skin flakes at all. (Olay's Daily Thermal Mini-Peel and Microdermabrasion Peel leave my skin red for a couple of days.) Worth every penny, will definitely continue using this product! This did a fantastic job to unclog my pores and help acne dry out.  It does look and smell like pureed pumpkin which I like. It also has a tiny amount of granules for surface exfoliation as well.  At times, there was a discernible tingling sensation but it wasn't irritating.  My only complaint is that the product runs out after a month of a half!  That makes it very expensive to keep up so I don't know if I will always have this on hand.  I did use it about 3 times a week. I have been using this Pumpkin peel mask for years.  It WORKS! Leaves my skin clean and renewed . Without fail, I get comments on my skin every-time I use this mask . I'm very disappointed in this product as a face peel. I was informed by Mychellle it was made to replace their Fiesta Fruit Peel. There's no comparison. I wish they'd bring that one back. This is my all time favorite mask! I love that it is ewg verified and it works great to detox my pores and keep my skin clear. went ahead and gave this product a 5.its a curious liitle skin care product i just stumbled on and ordered on a whim. i like natural products. its a very small jar. however the peel itself glides on very evenly and smooth and you only have to use a dab so it goes a long way. it seems to do what is promised. and its been very helpful for mild acne breakouts. plus it smells like Thanksgiving. i have a very fair complexion along with sensitive skin. this doesn't make my skin oily an hour after use or dry it out but rather seems to really balance things out."
517,B000MAOWO8,"Like the scent.  Feels refreshing on bare skin or over makeup. This is the best hyaluronic acid serum I've ever used. I've tried several others from (La Roche Posay, Neutrogena, CeraVe, The Ordinary) and have been disappointed by them all. I love the scent (reminds me slightly of honey), the texture (absorbs well and leaves no residue under other products), the hydration (I seal it in with a moisturizer and get compliments on my skin), and fact that it never irritates my sensitive skin. It's hard to find at most stores and fairly expensive, but I keep going back to it again and again. I recently purchased MyCHELLE Dermaceuticals Ultra Hyaluronic Hydrating Serum and have been extremely pleased with the results. The serum has a light, non-greasy texture that absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and smooth. It has helped to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and my skin has a more youthful and radiant appearance. I also appreciate that the serum is cruelty-free and made with natural ingredients. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their skin's hydration and overall appearance. This is a great moisturizer that I use daily. It has clean ingredients and is at a good price point. My only critique is that is has a super weird earthy smell, it kind of smells like hay or grass. I have extremely dry, flaky skin that laughed at just about every over-the-counter facial moisturizer you could think of.  I've tried Ponds, Oil of Olay, Neutrogena and none of them could hydrate my skin, much less heal it from the constant, itchy, flaking in three very noticeable trouble spots on my face.  By time I had washed my faced, used toner and applied the moisturizer, my skin was flaking as I began applying makeup; and within ten minutes after completing my makeup, the creases and dryness were even more apparent as my dry spots soaked in the makeup, creating unsightly discolorations.  After a while, I gave up and stopped wearing makeup for a long time.Well, after seven years of avoiding makeup, I decided to give it a try again (a new man in your life can do that sometimes).  I went back to the store like an idiot looking for the same products that had let me down in the past.  I then tried the more expensive department store brands, only to find them a waste of money.  I was losing hope.And then one day, I was here on Amazon looking for more natural blends, thinking maybe that would be the answer to my life-long issue with dry skin.Hallelujah.  MyChelle WORKS!  It really really works!Now some reviewers have complained about it being heavy, but if you're plagued with what I have, heavy is just fine!  After washing and toning, I applied MyChelle and I was instantly awed by the glow it gave my skin.  But the real test was if would stand up under my makeup.And it did.After nearly three decades of fighting with flaky, peeling skin under my foundation, MyChelle has come to the rescue.  And even the next day, after having removed the make up the night before, my skin has remained supple, soft and glowing.  The three problem areas I'd endured with peeling and dryness all my life are now healed.  Now, grant it, I have to keep up the regimen, but I can go two or three days without reapplying MyChelle where as I couldn't go 20 minutes after applying something like Ponds.Other Amazon reviews complain that it's expensive.  Well, for the tiny jar you get, it does seem pricey, but you don't need a lot of product!  One dollop the size of a dime will moisturize your face and neck.  And if your skin isn't as dry as mine, you'll use less than that.Reviews have also complained about the scent.  Well, it's not the best smelling stuff on the planet, but it works.  It has a very earthy, herbally scent.  At first, I thought it wasn't the most pleasing fragrance, but I'm used to it now and I kinda like it. After it's absorbed and my make up is on, I don't smell it anyhow.  A scent that smells like fresh-cut vegetables means nothing to the overall awesome quality of the product.If you have chronic, extremely dry skin, this is your answer. After trying many kinds of moisturizers, including those easily purchased at drug stores, expensive types like Lancome, etc, and many other supposedly ""natural"" products, I finally stumbled upon MyChelle products.  I have sensitive skin, though evidently not as sensitive as a couple of reviewers, and love every MyChelle product I've tried thus far.  Deep Repair Cream is a great moderately heavy moisturizer, though it is not at all greasy, and the smell is pleasantly mild.  I'm 31, and my skin is normal to dry; I find Deep Repair Cream perfect for the winter months (I live in a semi-arid climate).  I use it in the morning and MyChelle's Revitalizing Night Cream before bed.I've used MyChelle for about 3 years now and am still totally satisfied.  One reviewer remarked upon the price- I agree that they are not inexpensive, but neither are they out of proportion given the excellent ingredients and the amount of research in back of the products (check out MyChelle's website) and the price of comparable products.  Some other MyChelle products I've used: Fabulous Eye Cream (a great under eye cream; I don't have wrinkles to contend with, but I've also been using this for a number of years, so...); Perfect C Serum (#1 favorite MyChelle product...it's fabulous and I always notice a negative difference when I stop using it for a while); Revitalizing Night Cream (nice evening cream...a little heavier than deep repair, but I also can use it during the summer months when it's dry out and it's not too heavy); Pumpkin Renew Cream (a great lightweight moisturizer, especially for summer months); Fruit Enzyme Mist (WONDERFUL toner! Use it after applying C Serum or to refresh during the day); Clear Skin Serum (great for spot treating breakouts - use pumpkin renew cream afterward); Fruit Enzyme Scrub (really nice scrub; use it every other day or just once a week and it really smoothes out your skin); Oil-free Grapefruit Cream (a nice alternative for the summer, or if you're having any breakouts...)As you can see, I love MyChelle products!  I'm also very hard to please when it comes to facial products; every time I balk at the prices and try something else that promises the same thing (i.e. ""natural"" and cruelty-free), I end up going back to MyChelle.  Try it!(PS: They have great customer service, so I wouldn't hesitate to call up the company if you have any adverse reactions.  Also, they have recently added hypo-allergenic versions of some of their creams, so for highly sensitive skin, that would be the way to go.)"
518,B0018662UW,"Actually I really like garnier products...I feel it's reasonably priced and as good if not better than some of the products that you get from the department stores.  I am new to this product but so far so good.  Definitely would buy again I bought several of these because they stopped selling it in my local drug store.  I am glad I found it.  It's a great product and I like the texture and I believe it keep  my skin beautiful. I use this bottle up but I did not see much change, perhaps I need to offer more than one bottle. A nice smooth cream that makes my skin feel soft and smooth in the morning.  Don't know about the regenerating yet as I haven't been using it for very long. This product is wonderful! The consistency is light and it doesn't have an overpowering smell. It is probably one of the best products I've used on my hyper pigmentation- it helps to quickly fade the marks on my face. I have acne prone skin(I'm 24) and it doesn't clog my pores or make me breakout. It also works well on premature wrinkles. I've noticed I've been getting small lines on my forehead and slightly pronounced lines smile lines around my mouth-this product has helped reduce and diminish them. I didn't think a 1.7 oz tube would last that long-but mine has lasted about three months. Shipping time was good-the package arrived in less than a week. I would highly recommend this product! Does it smell good? Yeah. Does it feel good on? Sure. Was it affordable? Yep. But it has done nothing but clog my pores. My spots are just the same as ever. I know this product isn't specifically for spots but I read all the reviews on here and let my hopes get a little too high. I wouldn't recommend it. This is one of my favorite skin creams...really helps reduce wrinkles and smells so great! Even though it says overnight, I use it every morning after shower and at night. This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  The beautiful changes in my complexion/skin.  The long lush eyelashes that grow as a result of using this product is absolutely amazing.  I was crushed when it was no longer available in the stores.  I would have bought out the entire online available products but shipping is charged on every SINGLE one ordered, not just a one-time charge for the shipment."
519,B000PKZFTQ,"I was introduced to Dermalogica products after having a professional facial done at a spa. At the time I was having some issues with my forehead peeling and I did not know what to do about it. I have been using these products ever since. I wont use anything else. This is the best face product..have used for a long time I had an allergic reaction on my eyelids from makeup. My eyelids were red and raw. The first time I used this at night, I felt relief immediately and the rash was significantly better by morning. I had purchased and tried other products, none worked, they were irritating to the skin. Made things worse. This product was expensive but performed so much better than I expected. My face was irritated with any cream I tried and after that I decided to try dermalogica and this one looked like a perfect product, because I started to think that I lost my skin barrier. And it worked!!! My skin restored with this cream and got so silky. I definitely recommend it! I actually got more stuff from this brand and I’m very happy with it. I was trained using Dermalogica products as an esthetician and this product has helped my husband's rosasea that is a bother every winter. This product is amazing. Along with a skin care routine this help to restore a very damaged and inflamed skin. Its name truly speaks what it does!! My esthetician daughter gave me a tube of this, same brand and description, 12 years ago.  I just found it among my things, and have started using it, but about to run out.  Ordered this product online and it is the same as all those years ago.  It is amazing to use, glides on and soaks in immediately to leave a velvety smooth feeling face.  It's worth a little extra money.  I love it. This is a great addition product to use with Dermalogica creams. It will help smooth and heal the skin. My skin is extremely sensitive and dry and aging.  I use it anywhere my skin is reacting or in need of healing…… basically all over my face as a daily regimen after applying the cream. I’ve used it on foot callouses, and even on my hands to heal the reactions I have to detergents and caustic sanitizers and soaps (I have serious allergies to a variety of ingredients that result in blistering of my skin). My husband uses it with the Dermalogica cream to help heal his skin cancer scabs following treatment. These are pretty much miracle products for us."
520,B001E96L6I,"I have severely dry skin, occasionally bordering on eczema.  While this won't cure an outbreak, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth that outbreaks happen MUCH less often.  In fact, I haven't had one since I started using it.  This lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I had tried them all:  Lubriderm, Eucerin, Vaseline, Suave, you name it.  This is better than all of them combined.  Fragrance-free so the whole family can use it.  Thick and moisturizing without feeling greasy.  It feels so soft and smooth going on and really penetrates into the skin. It lasts all day, so I don't find myself scratching dry spots near the end of the day.  There are no dry spots!  I feel like doing a ""real person"" commercial for this lotion, and it's rare that I feel so positive about something.  If you have dry skin, this is the lotion to use. Works great on dry skin!No oily feel after. Completely odor free.I know several people that use this so here are some tips.When doing your hands, start with your nails. If they absorb it all, add more.Pack it against the cuticles and let it soak in (5 min), while doing the rest of your hands.This stuff will absorb into the skin, so for severe dry spots make a thick pad of it on the dry spot.After it absorbs, do it again. Do this a few times in a row until your skin won't take any more.Two days of that and the dry spot is gone. After that, just moisturizing maintenance. Aveeno is the only lotion that actually seems to moisturize my skin. I have extremely dry skin that gets itchy if I don't moisturize sometimes twice a day. I love the fact that this lotion has no smell and does not leave a sheen on my skin, nor does my skin feel greasy to the touch. I use this lotion on my face and body and feel that it has drastically improved my skin tone - no longer red in the t-zone - and I have fewer breakouts along my jaw line. I gave it four instead of 5 stars as this lotion does the trick, but the Aveeno body souffle works better. I wash my hands a lot throughout the day due to my job and I used to get really dry hands.  All other products I've tried through the past few months just didn't cut it and then someone suggested I try Aveeno so I picked up a few bottles here from Amazon.  The product does work well and doesn't wear off through the day however I find it takes quite a while for the lotion to soak into the skin before the oily feel goes away but other than that, I enjoy and use the product. I have been an Aveeno fan for years and used this product over the last several months so I thought I should write a little something about my experience.What I like about it is the colloidal oatmeal ingredients and the easy application. Its not greasy and it absorbs quickly. Its relatively safe for adults and kids as it relates to environmentally friendly ratings and natural product contents. It doesn't stain your clothes or have an obnoxious odor.Here's where I struggle a bit with it...its not really that natural. Read the ingredients and you will see what I mean. But more than that is it leaves a slightly tacky film on your skin after it dries. I think this is why they can say it lasts up to 24 hours. I keep this by the changing table and use it several times a day because changing diapers dries out hands like nothing else.  I have another one by the kitchen sink for use after washing bottles.  It has a mild scent (unscented), is not greasy, doesn't bother my son's skin if I touch him after putting it on.  I also looked it up on the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep website and found it has a very low toxicity rating, which is important to me.  I like this enough to include it in a gift basket for other new moms. I bought Aveeno thinking it was all natural, based on the label. I should have read the detailed ingredient list first!  This product contains Petrolatum, which is banned or restricted for use in cosmetics in the EU. The Environment Canada Domestic Substances List classifies Petrolatum as a high human health priority and as expected to be toxic or harmful. The European Union applies the risk phrase R 45 (May cause cancer) with Note N to petrolatum. Note N reads ''the classification as a carcinogen need not apply if the full refining history is known and it can be shown that the substance from which it is produced is not a carcinogen. This note applies to certain complex oil-derived substances in Annex I''.  PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are common contaminants in petrolatum, also called petroleum jelly. Among the studies linking the petrolatum impurity PAHs to breast cancer is a Columbia University study in which researchers found that the breast tissue of women with breast cancer was 2.6 times more likely to contain elevated levels of PAHs bound to DNA (called DNA adducts) than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer (Rundle et al. 2000). The National Toxicology Programs finds that some PAHs are reasonable anticipated to be human carcinogens, and the State of California lists a number of PAHs as carcinogens in its Proposition 65 program (NTP 2002, OEHHA 2004).  Shame on Aveeno for putting petrolatum in a product they tout as all natural! As a guy who doesn't use a whole lot of lotion type products I was pretty lost about a year ago when I developed an inch long dry spot on my face.  I tried several different lotions and creams with absolutely no change.  I was starting to consider seeing a dermatologist when I saw the reviews on this stuff and decided to give it a try.Within a week, my face cleared up (this is after having this dry spot for over 6 months).  Now I use it almost every morning - something I never thought I would do with lotion.  I recommend it very highly."
521,B001CJFEKY,"My dermatologist recommended this product, and it’s the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. Highly recommended ! I was really wanting this to work for me.  I have hypersensitive, dry skin along with rosacea so a very difficult combo to have.  I need to moisturize multiple times a day, otherwise my skin feels tight and gets red and activates my rosacea.  I feel like this did moisturize ok and I didn't have to re-apply as often but something in it still irritated my skin enough after a few days of use to make it red in color.  When this happens I do a detox mask and go back to my Rodan & Fields soothe moisturizer and having to re-apply multiple times daily.  There is a slight smell to it, not fragranced like perfume but enough that I noticed which right away made it questionable to me but I wanted to try it anyways.  Unfortunately this does not work for me and I am in search again of a good moisturizer for my difficult skin type. I gave it one star for value only because it didn't work for me.  If I was able to use it I don't mind spending a little more on a product. I have been using Skinceuticals A.G.E. Interrupter and other products in the line for several years, and love them.  I have often switched skincare lines in the past but have stuck with Skinceuticals for about 7 years.  I like the A.G.E but it is very expensive and I thought I would try their less expensive moisturizers.  Although my skin is combination, it is very dry where I live, so I looked for moisturizers for dry skin. This product makes my skin feel great but it is not quite as emollient as I expected,  I have to apply it a couple of times a day when it is really dry. That is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  However, humidity is often in single digits here, so it takes industrial strength moisturizers to make a dent in skin dryness.  Using lotions and moisturizers multiple times a day is routine.  This seems like a very good product so I will see how it goes and update if necessary. This moisturizer was recommended to me by a woman who does facials at a resort. I don't know if she is supposed to promote this line of skin care but she's used it on me twice. I bought it based on her recommendation as well as how I liked the way it felt after the facial. It's light but but an effective moisturizer. By that I mean that my face doesn't dry out or feel stiff, tight or heavy after using it and my skin feels moisturized for several hours after applied. My facial skin is a mixture of oily and dry and this product works well with it. I've tried lots of different moisturizers over the years and I've liked this one for a longer period of time than any other I've used in the pastIt's hard to recommend or not recommend this type of product because one's experience with moisturizers is something personal and dependent on skin type and what the user likes or doesn't like in a moisturizer. But I can say that I've been using this moisturizer for over a year and still love it. The price is too high Terribly fake! Smells terrible and burns! Was in Chinese bottle also I love the Skinceuticals line in general, but I am a raving fan of this face cream and have been using it for years. It's my go-to face moisturizer and the reason people guess my age to be late 20's, rather than late 30's.  I used to spend an absolute fortune purchasing this at my favorite spa, and one day decided to try ordering it online.  I had no idea it was available on Amazon but thrilled that it was, and thrilled that it was less than half the price I was paying at my spa.As an added bonus- The glass container itself is a very high quality, heavy frosted glass- After the bottle is empty, I use it to keep coconut oil around the house :) I buy this mainly in the winter months since it is a nice texture for dry weather.  It's a little pricey, but $63 is about the best price you can get even at a spa so I also buy it there.  It goes a long way, so only a dime size in your hand will moisturize the whole face.  Before this product, I was using Harry's Men's moisturizer which is great in the summer but left me scaling in the winter."
522,B000X8H61U,"I bought it because i suffer from Rosacea and i read in reviews that it has helped other sufferers. It has only been two months so it's hard to say at this stage if it helped or not, but i do see some improvment. The texture is very thin and runny, but it soaks in very quickly and leaves the skin feeling moist. For some reason my skin just hasn't changed. Been over a month, and the product hasn't seemed to have done one thing. It also really burns my skin. Like really burns. Also, the packaging came pretty undone...who's to say that there wasn't any other substances added to the bottles since they weren't secured at all? Just weird... This was my last purchase to complete the Suki care line I'm on and I must say it's the icing on the cake.  I exfoliate, use the balancing toner, then follow through with this day lotion (all Suki products) and my skin has never look so radiant.  I was first turned off by the smell because it is really concentrated but you get over that once you see the effects.  I also like how the first ingredient isn't water like most drug store lotions.  Secondly, this is the first time I've been using a lotion on a daily basis because I have very oily skin and don't want to add more sheen/moisture/oil to my face, but this facial lotion actually helps to improve overall complexion (dulls redness of any blemishes and scars) and mattes your face.  I mean I still use oil blotting wipes to control the oil but it's because it's habit by now and not prompted by obvious oil build up on the face.  In other words, it makes oil build up on the face a lot less noticeable, it doesn't get rid of it.  I knocked off a star because of the amount that's given.  1 fl oz isn't much, especially compared to how much toner and facial exfoliant Suki provides.  And the thing isn't cheap either.  But overall, I recommend this product and the whole Suki skin care line to people with very oily skin and random blemishes. I honestly do not know what I would do without this moisturizer. If Suki ever goes out of business or discontinues it I will be devastated. I never write reviews but if anything I have ever bought deserves one, this product is it!The  balancing day lotion is the only moisturizer I have ever used that works miracles on my skin. I've always suffered from acne...hormonal/cystic/the whole shebang! I'm 30 and still dealing with it! I used to buy this moisturizer at Whole Foods but since they stopped carrying it I usually order it through Amazon. I go through it pretty quickly and there have been many times I've run out and decided to try something cheaper and more easily accessible (I'm always trying to save money), but I go back to Suki within a matter of days every. single. time. It's seriously THE best for problem skin! I've used a lot of Suki products but this moisturizer and the concentrated clarifying toner are two I cannot and will not live without. When my wife first discovered Suki products some 10 years ago, I also became her guinea pig in using them as well. Now, I am a slightly older gentleman these days, but I have to admit, Suki does a man's face alright. Before using their products, I used to think that having a dry face was normal, but now I know better.  After my shower each morning, I add both the spray toner and the lotion to my face and frankly, I am addicted to it now. It has a natural scent, almost neutral and that's good for me. If my wife were to write this review, it would be far more detailed and ecstatic for her love of Suki products. I have to admit. I love Suki now too. I have sensitive skin and allergic to the chemical compound form of salicylic acid that are usually in most skin care products.  I tried this product two years ago after reading the ingredients on the package, and found that the salicylic acid in it is extracted naturally from white willow bark.  It is also packed with many antioxidants in natural from and loaded with vitamins that are excellent for skin.  Since the ingredients are natural, my sensitive skin has not experienced any side effects at all.I use this with vitamin c serum, and my skin looks glowing even with little to no make up.  I absolutely love it! I agree with the last review as well, there is definitely a very noticeable change in Ingredients and quality in my recent purchases of Suki products. My skin got very irritated from the new formula and the smell of the product is terrible now. Sadly I will have to find other brands now. I have been using Suki for over ten years. My skin is terribly fickle.  And I never know when or why it changes it's mind....but this lotion tends to always work for my skin without causing breakouts.  It is really good during summer months.  I had to supplement it or use a heavier moisturizer during the extremely cold dry months-but still use this for day time.  Been using it for several years now and each time I try to move away from it thinking it might not be as effective, I come back after a few weeks.  Soaks right in and does not take much...about 2 drops on still damp skin if you break out easily gives good results."
523,B000RGBWPO,"My skin is like the desert sands.  It's thirsty. Very thirsty.  Any other lotions and moisturizers I've tried either did nothing or made my skin feel sticky amd feel oily.  Palmers Cocoa Butter quenches my skin's thirst and leaves it silky smooth without being sticky. I developed a serious case of peripheral artery disease in my lower legs. I was told this was incurable, but there was treatment including medications. The condition was bad enough to have me walking with two canes due to pain and hypersensitivity. The legs below the knees became discolored to a shade of light maroon. The skin texture changed to something like dry, old leather. I was terrified. I didn't want the drugs, so I began to battle this by first, buying a pedaling unit and placing it in front of my living room chair. If I was sitting in it, I was pedaling. Second, I started doing deep massaging of the legs three times a day. What I found is that most lotions and creams break down from heavy massaging, and become kind of grainy. Then I found this Palmer's product. I was dubious that something this inexpensive for a big jar would work out. Not so. It was perfect in so many ways. I'd put it in one palm and work it into a salve-like consistency, then rub it onto my legs. The massaging hurt a lot when I started doing it, because this product allowed me to keep up the pressure longer. The Palmer's cream started working its magic in a matter of days. The texture improved a little every day. The color lightened, and the awful tightness relaxed. I was soon using one cane, then none. Between the pedaling for a few hours a day, and the frequent massaging, my legs are cured. They look normal now, and I can walk through stores with no difficulty. Palmer's is a fantastic product. I just ordered another jar as I still do one daily massage after a session of pedaling. No more lotion after using this product. The moisturizing effect of this product is amazing. it penetrates well and lasts. There's no irritation nor greasy feel. The scent is mild and disappears quickly so does not interfere with any perfume applied. It's great!! I recently had knee surgery and they used cocoa butter at physical therapy so I got this to help moistuize the scar but I found it's great for all over. Very Moisturizing last really long and gives your skin a nice glow. definitely gets rids of any ashyness. perfect for every skin type especially dry skin and combination skin. I liked how it used to be. The smell was stronger and it was harder and thicker but I think I’ll get used to the softer consistency. The smell is still great but I wish it was as strong as it used to be. I used to use this religiously and loved it because it had a nice vanilla, kind of chocolatey scent where I hardly even needed to add perfume. That’s really my only complaint. I’m happy otherwise because it goes nicely with my perfume and body spray (VS Bare Vanilla mist & Montale Vanille Absolu perfume)update: it’s still very moisturizing but still upset about seemingly diluted formula. I found that it works best on my skin if I do it outside of the bathroom after my shower rather than inside when it’s still steamy. I was coming to order more but I saw the price went up to $11. It was like $7 when I paid for it a week or two ago so I’ll just have to get it from the store. This formula of cocoa butter is wonderful.  I use it all over after a shower while my pores are still open.  It clears up the dryness from the cold weather abd it lasts.  Please try this soft formula.  You won't be disappointed. Love this for my dry skin. Use it immediately after shower. Keeps my skin hydrated the whole day and love the subtle scent."
524,B000F6Y55A,"I have just used this product for the first time tonight. I actually just washed it off about 5 minutes ago. I can honestly say there was a significant change in the redness of my face! It was also very refreshing and tingly while I had the mask on. It felt like my face was being cleaned deep into the pores. I mainly got this product because I have acne scaring. Not the kind that leave actual indents on your face, but the ones that leave a darker colored hue on the skin. Obviously because I've only used it once I haven't seen any change in the scarring which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars for now. But because the redness went down and it felt so refreshing, I have high hopes for this product! I'll edit my review in a couple weeks! Fingers crossed! :)***EDIT!!!***So I've been using this mask for about a week now. At least 5 or 6 times I've used it so far. At first I rated it 3 stars but I had to move it up to 4 because it is just so refreshing I love it! Plus it really does help with redness in the face. I mainly bought it for some acne scarring. Is it getting rid of it? I think so. I'm not 100% sure though. I think some of the scaring has lightened but at the same time it could just be wishful thinking! With that said, if it is reducing the scarring then its doing it very lightly so its hard to tell for sure so far. Will I keep buying this product? Yes! Mainly because it is very cheap and it feels amazing on the face. Only time will tell if my scarring is actually fading or not. Plus I haven't had any breakouts yet while using it so that's a plus too! I actually bought ""Skin Obsession 40% glycolic peel"" here on amazon because it had a 4 star rating and its for pretty much every skin problem you can think of: acne, acne scarring, wrinkles, age spots, etc. Its $16.99 so a little more expensive but hey its a chemical peel what do you expect? lol. Its strong and salon quality so I'm hoping this will make a bigger impact on the scarring of my face. Some people freak when they hear ""chemical peel"" but its mainly just killing that first layer of dead skin so that fresh, new skin cells come to the surface. But I will definitely keep using this product as well! Good luck to everyone looking for a cure for whatever skin issue they have! :) It didn't change my skin THAT much, but I did notice my acne scars begin to fade. I did just start using it though, so it might make a bigger difference. I'll be sure to edit this when I finish this bag and my next. It makes your skin feel so clean, though. While it's on if really feels like it's cleansing your skin. I also noticed my breakouts disappeared, so if you're looking for a cheap mask to help with acne, this could be it!So I first reviewed this and gave it four stars because it made my skin feel clean and helped a little with breakouts. At first, it didn't help with my acne marks/redness/scars AT ALL. I'm almost done with my second bag and I wanted to update. I suffered from VERY severe acne. I had acne covering my entire face, now I have no acne left (I used the clarisonic + cetaphil, neutrogena 2 in 1 fight&fade toner, and a skin clearing lotion/moisturizer for a few months that worked WONDERS on my skin). I was left with very red, acne marks. I had tried so many expensive things, but nothing seemed to work! I bought this because it was cheap, so why not try it? At first I was a bit disappointed. But now my redness has gone down drastically (after my second bag.) which is saying something because my skin is AWFUL. This is definitely worth trying, just make sure to buy two and give it a chance! I used it 2-3 times a week for about 4 weeks so yeah if you use just a teaspoon of powder with 2 tsp of water it should cover up your face evenly. Some of the contents in the mixture are hydrophobic so you might wanna add a little bit of water and mix it in real good before it turns into a face. I mistakenly added too much water at first attempt cause the powder wasn't mixing and it ended up being too thin to apply evenly. That aside, for me it didn't work like the wonderful magical charm I was expecting after reading the reviews. It does leave my skin really soft and looking clean but the effect is only temporary and may be it's just a coincidence or not, I always broke out a few pimples right after using it like the morning after. So I can't say for sure how good this product works...maybe it just didn't work for me and worked for others. The price is really low so it doesn't hurt to try I guess. Maybe it will work for someone else as well as it does for some people here. Okay, so I really do like this product. But one thing is DO NOT USE WHOLE BAG!! My mistake was that I mixed the whole thing and tried to put it in a locked-tub thing to use it the next day, and it dried out :/ luckily I had bought 2 bags! But anyways, I have acne scars literally all over my face. I found online that lemon juice helps acne scars, so I started using this product and lemon at the same time. Over night I had the lemon on my face and in the morning for an hour I used this product on my face. My scars are really actually fading!! I've been doing thia for a little over a week, and it's going good! Just make sure you have extra bags for when you run out ;) If you're thinking this probably won't work, it's not worth the money, then stop right there. I've used this mask only four times so far, and the results are DRAMATIC! I noticed a small change after the first use, but I woke up this morning, and seriously almost didn't recognize myself in the mirror. About 90% of my dark spots and marks are gone. The rest are now more blended in and smooth. The mask also seems to tone my skin.I am currently using this mask and the Grapeseed 100% Pure Carrier Base Oil, which is good for acne prone skin. They both are worth the money.Some advice: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT USE THE ENTIRE BAG. Just pour a good two dollups into a bowl with a little bit of water and mix it in, then start putting it on your face. My first and fourth uses, I left it on overnight instead of the 15-20 minutes.This product is less then ten bucks, and free shipping, so why not? Give it a shot! You won't be disappointed!"
525,B000EGOKV0,"My wife has used this soap for years and says it treats he skin the best of all soaps she has ever tried. If you have dry or sensitive skin, you will love this! For your face and body! I have been using Olivella bar soap as a face and body wash since my mom bought it for the house -- must have been over 6 years ago. I only use natural, vegan, cruelty-free products and all other natural body washes made my skin itch, or gave me red bumps. It's not moisturizing enough for me on it's own (usually use coconut oil when I get out of the shower because I like my skin super soft), but my skin isn't tight and dry if I decide skip the after-shower moisturizing, like it tends to be with other body washes. It lathers and gets you squeaky clean. I'm so glad I found this when I was young instead of spending a fortune on expensive face cleansers -- I look young for my age and people always compliment my skin -- I'm not saying it's only because of Olivella, but that's the only thing that has remained constant throughout the years of my skincare regimen. Enjoy : ) This is the only soap we use for our daughter. For three years, she had red, rough, itchy patches of skin, until someone brought us a bar of olive oil soap from a trip to Greece. We had tried so many special soaps and lotions and detergents that we were really afraid to let her even use this unknown soap for fear it would make her skin 'angry' and broken. After the first use, her skin looked less angry, by the third use her skin started to clear. We started trying to find 100% olive oil soap and ended up looking in artisanal soap shops, no one had it or made it. We finally found this on Amazon. Four years later, we now order Olivella in the 12 bar box. It is the only soap we will use on her skin, and it has kept her skin clear and healthy. I bought this product because I have dry, sensitive skin.  I used it as my soap and it even replaced my shaving cream.  I even got my husband to use it in the shower as well.  We live in Louisiana and I take 2 showers a day in the winter and 2 to 3 showers a day the rest of the year.  This soap left my skin moisturized and hydrated.  Also, there is no offensive smell.HOWEVER, we stopped using this soap because it clogged up our pipes.  We had to have a plumber come out and see what the problem was.  It was just the master bath shower and the pipes were coated with what looked like coagulated oil (like the coagulated fat in the frying pan after you fry bacon).  It was horrible!  We wanted to keep using this soap but if we did, it would clog up our plumbing at home. Purchased this as a pack of 12 for $25.99 & this price makes the soap worth the money.  It has a faint pleasant scent & does leave skin softer than most soaps. When it comes to bath tub rings & residue, it also leaves a bit more than usual, but at about $2 a bar it is a pretty good purchase.  Appears to have fewer allergy aggravating ingredients than most.  After bathing you can skip moisturizers.4-21-15 I'm adding an update: I bought this in 2013 & shared a few from the package with a friend.  I use it daily & still have a couple of bars left. I'm quite surprised it hasn't developed a rancid odor since many olive oil mixed products do over time.  My home is 80 degrees in Summer so I didn't expect the soap to preserve well, but it really has. I subscribed for this soap and was very excited that finally found something ""natural"" with a reasonable price, but it was a big disappointment right after the first usage.First of all, no one in our family liked the smell: it's too powdery and strong and definitely not refreshing. In fact I would prefer if it was unscented instead.Then the quality: the bar develops a thick layer of slime-like sludge after few minutes it is left on a soap dish. I first thought it will go away and it's just the first use, but the sludge kept being generated over and over. I then thought it might be the soap-dish, thus left the bar on a wired shelf over night and found the sludge was still there in the morning.This might be a unique property of the olive-based soaps and others might be fine with it, however -- even if it is unique property -- it's unacceptable for us. I even have a notion that the sludge might build up inside the drainage.Why 2 stars then? I liked how it is treated the skin which felt soft and moisture-balanced. I wish it smelled better and didn't have the sludge, then I would definitely buy this soap and recommend others. The soap is smooth and has good lather. I have sensitive skin and it feels lovely. If you want a cute, pink, flowery perfumed soap this is not for you.  If you want an ugly green soap with  gentle sudsing that is clean rinsing and doesn't leave your skin dry, itchy, or feeling like it has been shrunk in the wash, this is your soap.  I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin or that has a contact allergy to many soaps like I do.  It is the first soap I've ever used that didn't cause my face to break out with at least one big pimple after every wash and I'm 64 !  Oh, this is sold at a good price too."
526,B000HJT1FE,"I have really sensitive skin too because I'm Chinese and have allergies. If I so much as accidentally press too hard or scrape my face skin, it will stay reddish forever, or even develop a rash if I don't leave it alone. I have SUPER dry skin on my face, yet can have an oily forehead on some days.I actually took my chances a long time ago on using this stuff. They also have more Aloe products that go with that, such as a toner, a Night Cream, and an extremely gentle exfoliating Face-wash. I currently also have the exfoliating facewash and after I'm done using it, my face feels all smooth :D Then I slap on my Aloe Day Cream and I'm ready to go :D It goes on me like silky butter, and I can feel my skin THIRSTING FOR IT if I do not put it on! It does not make me feel oily or clogged-up at all. My oilier hairline doesn't seem to mind this cream at all.There is a review on this Day Cream; the girl said that she felt it smelled like vomit and was horrible and such. I don't recommend you listen to her, because anything with aloe is going to well.. SMELL like aloe. The Day Cream's aloe scent is mega mild anyway, -and- I enjoy it so I don't agree with her.If I do break out, it's never because of this cream. It seems that for me, pimples can be really light colored, yet hurt like a horrible beesting. I just take care of it with that Aloe face-wash and then slap on a tiny dot of Proactiv for each zit to dry it out.I believe The Body Shop also has a similar line just for crazy skin that can't figure out if it's dry or oily. I wanted to try that out too but I was so happy with this Aloe one that I don't care anymore.Every time I wake up, I actually look forward to putting this Day Cream stuff on my face. It feels so RELIIIIEEVVVINNGG. I have random dry spots sometimes along my jaw or my forehead, and it clears it up. After I shower, I rub it on and make happy-faces while I wait for the initial absorption. After that dries, I rub it on AGAIN. If this cream were a Pokemon, and my dry skin were another, then every time this Day Cream attacks, it's super effective!It makes my nose really smooth too, so I keep randomly touching my nose. My face wants to talk to me and thank me now, I swear. I was looking for a substitute moisturizer for Boscia Revitalizing Black Hydration Gel, but of course nothing seems to be comparable since they are all different. I did not want to pay a lot of money for something that only cost that much due to brand name. I stumbled across this Aloe Vera moisturizer along with the day cream. I did my research on the ingredients, how it compares to other top brands, and the reviews people gave. I was a little worried because it was 'cheap' but I think it's a social mentality. Not all 'cheap' products are bad. So I bought the night cream and day cream to try and I LOVE IT. I use it on my face as well as bug bites.This moisturizer did not make me feel like I have a ton of oil on my face. I have combination dry/oily skin with some acne. I don't use foundation or any make-up besides eye liner. I definitely noticed a difference in my skin. It's less flaky and dry but not too oily. It's like matte. There is also a cool sensation. My face is a lot smoother than usual... and I love it. It feels like I have baby skin again! I don't need to apply a lot to cover my skin so this product lasts for a long time. I've always been on a search for the right moisturizer that works for me and THIS works for ME. Despite all the positive reviews, make sure  you do your research and see if it FITS FOR YOU and YOUR SKIN.I also used this on bug bites, mainly mosquitoes. I get a bad allergic reaction and swell up. It literally looks like someone punched me wherever the mosquito bite is. I applied the night cream and it was soothing, mainly because of Aloe Vera. Because it's so soothing, I didn't feel the urge to scratch and can slept well. The next morning it was practically gone. This is the first time anything worked on me so well and I'm happy with it. This review goes for the DAY and NIGHT cream. I also suggest the Day cream with SPF. If you’re someone who is skeptical of products that aren’t sealed then don’t get this. It’s going on your face. It was also not full all the way? I was very excited to find that some Body Shop products are being sold on Amazon. I am an Army nurse deployed to Afghanistan where I very much NEED moisturizer (very harsh water!), and the half jar I'd brought was running out. Amazon is usually pretty fast and reliable with shipping to APO addresses, so I ordered some. When I received it, I was VERY disappointed. The lid was apparently not all the way on, and half of the moisturizer ended up outside of the jar, all over the inside of the box. :( Also, when I've ordered this item from the Body Shop, it always has that little plastic insert over the cream, once you remove the lid, that you then have to remove to access the product. None of the Body Shop products I've ordered from Amazon have had this plastic insert, which makes me slightly suspicious -- am I buying old stuff? What's the deal? Yuck. In any case, I love this product, but I will probably cease ordering Body Shop items on Amazon. I am a redhead with fair/sensitive skin that tends to dry in the T-zone and chin, and I thought the world might end when the Body Shop discontinued the hemp face moisturizer (I still miss that stuff!), but this is a fair replacement."
527,B000W3WP1W,"I like and dislike this product. But I had mild acne and going back, my acne wasn't that bad. I just had a lot of scars and acne on the side of my face. But my acne hasn't gotten any better. I expected this to be a miracle product to be honest.I used this twice a day, in the morning and in the shower. When I initially tried it, it started to sting my face. The bumps on the right side of my face flattened and went away. Scars were still there.But what makes me think this is for severe acne, is because it helped me when I had a cystic acne. I never get those, but I experimented very wrongly with tea tree oil (it isn't bad, I used too must on my bare skin) and now I have the worst scar ever. However, when I was using the black soap, it continually flattened it out and I don't think any other product could have done that, and very quickly too.But I grew tired of the stinging. My cheeks would burn like my skin was coming off. My acne scars looked a little shiny. But it never did anything for them. I have oily skin, and it never dried out my skin so I don't know what the stinging was about. I do not have sensitive skin. I have ""MY SKIN CAN TAKE ON THE WORLD!"" type of skin. So the stinging was scary.When I had big bumps, it flattened that but they never completely went away. Even my smallest acne, it wouldn't do anything for it, but the big pimples it would flatten.It also did nothing for blackheads. I didn't feel like it was deep cleaning my face either.Again I think this would be right for people who have huge pimples or severe acne. This flattens out huge pimples magically.All you need is a dime size (or half a dime size) as well. It lathers very good. IT will last a long time in the jar because you need a small amount.Also when I was threading my chin for the first time, I got HUGE bumps all over. This took care of it in a few days. Another reason why I think this is for severe, big pimple type acne.I guess I'll just keep it incase I get a huge pimple. I notice where it would burn, my face was shiny.edit : I noticed there is a review that says his/her son saw improvement in their acne then it just stopped and they ended up switching products. I also just switched products. Again, I do not feel like the black soap DEEP CLEANS into pores. It would just heal any harsh acne on the first layer of your skin.Ingredients : Palm Kernel oil, Palm oil, and water. What's funny is my mom told me to stay away from Palm Oil on my face. I have not looked it up but my mother has clear skin so I should probably listen to her (haha).Also this is not to be compared with the black soap that comes in a bar. That one has more ingredients and I heard it to be more harsh. I do not want to try it though... Let me start by saying I have the worst face cleansing habits in the history of faces. I sleep with makeup on, will sometimes run out the door applying new make up over old, and more often only wash my face once a day rather than two. I stopped having bad breakouts several years ago, after which my irresponsible face regimen took hold, but in the last year I have been plagued with hormonal cystic acne under my neck. =(  It's been ugly to look at and painful to touch.I heard about African Black Soap from some friends who work in Hollywood and I rushed to Amazon to buy every version of it could find. I bought 4 different types of black soap and I tried this one first. It's not even been two weeks and already nearly all of my hormonal acne is gone and my skin looks lighter and brighter. After reading the reviews, I had an inkling these soaps would be great on my sensitive, breakout prone skin but I could not have known to what degree. Even with only washing my face once a day, the improvements are astonishing!! In the past I've used Acutane (I don't recommend using anything so harsh on the body), Retin-A, tea tree oil mixed face washes and toners from the Body Shop which were good but didn't give me results anywhere near this soap, Proactive Solution which didn't work for me, and pretty much every kind of sulfate and parabin free face cleansing program available at Target and Whole Foods.I'm amazed at how this one natural product cares for my skin better than the most expensive, doctor prescribed, commonly used products available to us.If you have issues with breakouts, oily skin, acne scars, etc., I would recommend starting here for a mere $4-$10 (depending on which version of the Black Soap you prefer).I have had acne my whole life and am now 31 still dealing with blemishes and hormonal acne. If I would have tried this product sooner, it could have saved from applying countless harsh chemicals to my face, ingesting dangerous doctor prescribed meds, and years of embarrassment.Gah! I love this stuff! I have been dealing with pretty profound hormonal acne for a couple of years now, and have tried almost everything to clear it up, including three or four different brands of acne cleanser/toner/cream combinations, and then the oil cleansing method of natural skin care (which did make my skin more healthy and radiant, but did not stop my break outs).I have been using this product for about a month, and I am absolutely astonished at how much my skin has improved in that short period of time.  The first week or so, my skin purged a bit, and I had small bumps on my face, particularly on my forehead, and two cystic acne bumps on my jaw line.  Once this cleared, as the soap deeply cleansed my pores of the gunk that was piled up in there, my skin has been radiant and amazing.  I have not developed a single pimple (even through my monthly cycle when I'm usually guaranteed at least 2 or 3), I have noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my acne scars, my pores are smaller, and my skin is incredibly soft and taught.  I have been cleansing with this soap 1-2 times per day (usually once) and follow it by rubbing a pea sized amount of raw African shea butter on my face.  In a month's time I am perhaps 1/4 of the way through the container of black soap, so I imagine this container will last me for several months.  I only use this on my face - I imagine if you used it on your entire body it would get used up much more quickly.  I have not even made a visible dent in the shea butter, which was of similar cost.  I imagine that will last me a year.  I am truly amazed that something that costs $8 could have such a profound effect on my skin.  I can't imagine using anything else on my skin at this point.  This stuff is absolutely amazing.  seriously.  try it. Just what I wanted. It works and it works well."
528,B00005T83D,"It takes everything in me not to gnaw on this delicious bar. The scent is absolutely yummy. My sensitive skin adores this wildly moisturizing soap. It’s GREAT to shave with…better than shave gel! It never dries me out, lasts forever, and the price is absurdly cheap. I’ve been buying this beauty for years and plan to never stop! Did everything as described will be purchasing again I am 62 and trying to grow older gracefully. I love this product. I use it every morning and at night before bed along with the Palmers face oil and my skin feels great and I’ve noticed a difference in it. I’ve purchased so many other moisturizers and wasn’t happy with the results after using for awhile. The Palmers face oil and soap are great. I will continue to use them and stop paying so much more money for all the other moisturizers. Dry skin, dry skin, dry skin... the story of my life.  That and extremely sensitive skin.  The list of products that causes itchy skin and painful rashes is endless.  At the suggestion of my doctor, I decided to switch to cocoa butter EVERYTHING -- lotion, soap, you name it.Before using this soap, getting out of the shower was a miserable experience.  Immediately after toweling off, my skin was so dry that I was afraid it was about to crack.  I was always racing to a bottle of lotion to bring relief and rid my body of that extra-tight feeling all over my body.  A bottle of lotion would last me about a week.Oh. My. Goodness.  This made a huge difference, and I noticed it instantly.  The first time I used this soap, I didn't feel like a reptile anymore.  What an improvement!The smell isn't overpowering, and there isn't any soap residue.  It comes off cleanly when rinsing.  Best of all, it doesn't irritate my skin whatsoever.I just wish they made this in a body wash or shower gel form.  But until then, I'm definitely sticking with this.  Great product. Like many vets I use the Cocoa butter on large scars-it's magic for helping with the pain!  I thought I would try the soap for itchy skin in the winter.  Far better than oatmeal soap which is really pretty good. The whole Palmers line is wonderful! I love the scent the way it makes my skin feel. A little goes a long way!  Coco butter is an old school remedy used for years to improve ethnic skin tones.  I hadn’t used any palmers products since my two pregnancies well over 20 years ago.  I have been spending  hundreds of dollars on products. I am trading in all my expensive Department store brought, skin products, oils and designer moisturizers for whole Palmers line! I love it ! I'm giving this product 5 stars, not the price. I have been using this soap for the last 9 maybe 10 years to wash my face and I get constant compliments on how clear my skin is, how smooth it looks and my even complexion. I think the fact that anyone has been so loyal to a particular product really says something about it. Although I have tried other skin care products in the past and even other cocoa butter brand soaps, I keep coming back to this. It's half the price at Walmart though. They were just sold out and I was in desperate need. I love this soap.  The smell is not overpowering.  It is just right."
529,B000CIU7H6,"I thought it wold make a great yankee swap gift and I was right. Not only fun, but also practical and inexpensive. Fast delivery, too.  The butt side is gray not brown like it is pictured This was a gag gift. The recipient actually used it and said that he would buy this himself. It is great stocking stuffer 2 halves of soap, 'glued' together.It doesn't smell that great, it doesn't last very long, 2 halves tend to pull apart When we ordered these, we thought the words FACE and BUTT would be in the opposite color so they would really stand out on the soap.  However, they don't.  They're the same color as each bar of soap so don't show up as well as we had hoped.  Still funny though.  We got the soap and the matching towel for a gag gift."
530,B000QUKAUE,"Me encanta,lo.compro frecuentementeExcelentes resultados hey guys so I was pretty hesitant to buy this at first because I've used so many acne creams and at first they would seem to work but then when I would stop using the creams my acne would come back! so I bought this cream because I was researching other mary kay products and I noticed that pretty much all the Mary Kay products on Amazon had 4 stars or higher. So it got me thinking that maybe this might work and it really did! i only used it a few times and i have no more acne. It literally goes away so fast with one application and the pimple size decreases. I also use witch hazel with aloe vera in combination with my skin care routine and my acne is finally gone! would definitely recommend this to anyone. gluck! ""My acne fighting cream us actually working well, except for the discomfort of a harsh allergic burning feeling.  This will become a very unfortunate side effect, even if it is used one time instead of three tines per day."" Here is what my daughter said about this product: ""This is not a ""miracle"" for acne, as the cause is hormonal and genetic, but this does help heal new acne. It can dry out already dry areas, but helps on oily areas.  I recommend starting with a little bit and working up toward more coverage, as it made my skin a bit itchy when I first started using it (about a week ago.)  Yes, I still get constant new break-outs, but this seems to be the best of the topical OTC treatments I have tried for a while.  I am a female, age 19, and have recently gone on The Pill for my skin which has especially helped minimize breakouts on my back, but I always have 2-4 new spots on my face to deal with on an ongoing basis.  So far, I am happy with the product, and do not find it as drying or harsh as, say, 10% benzoyl peroxide."" I'm so thankfully there are still distributors for this product! It makes my acne go away so quickly! For $5, this thing will prevent an acne from becoming a zit if you apply it early enough (when you start feeling it on your face).  I've used this thing in the past on myself, I also bought it for my sister and she also said it worked real well.The only problem is Mary Kay is not a well-known brand and is not well-advertised.  So these items won't sell fast enough and a lot of time, these tube will come expired (I've bought it twice from 2 different sellers in the past year, and they all came expired).  Just ask for a refund if you run into such problem. I have always loved Mary Kay Products but they are very expensive from a dealer.  On Amazon the proces are reasonable.  My Mom was 94 when she died and was always asked how did she keep her skin so beautiful.  No lines, glowing, soft, nice smell..This particular poduct works really well with any skin break outs on your face.  If your skin breaks out, apply as instructed and in a few days your skin is clear and healthy.What can I say,  Even though I have tried other products I am a Mary Kay Girl. The Mary Kay Acne Treatment Gel is an inexpensive spot treatment for acne blemishes.  It lasts quite a while and does a pretty good job. After cleansing your face, you apply a small amount of the spot treatment to blemish. Allow to ""sink in"" and dry well before putting on any makeup or moisturizer. I've never had a problem with it drying my skin out, although some people may have a hard time with benzoyl peroxide products."
531,B000VD1UM8,"Castile Bar Soap that's unscented and feels great on your hands without leaving a greasy residue?Yes, indeed, 'nuff said.Oh, you wanted more? In this heavily artificially and naturally scented/dyed world, living without scenting products has been a massive improvement for my asthma and allergies. Unfortunately it is very difficult to locate soap products that are truly unscented and not petroleum based.We used to get this by the bar from WinCo, but suddenly they stopped carrying it, as did Walmart. Happy to bulk buy it like this and at a better price than in-store. It's soap, so it doesn't go bad. Not quite as smooth a feel on your skin after usage vs liquid castile soap, but doesn't cause dryness or irritation that most petroleum and scented options will due. We have natural moisturizer, but between this and liquid castile soap, we have eliminated the need for it entirely.Doesn't leave you feeling greasy like 'moisturizing' soaps typically do. Genuinely does not smell like anything other than the most faintest hint of coconut. Don't smell it? Probably still have scents in your life. Join us in our world where you can actually smell and taste things again, like the chemical cleaner taste in cheap factory bread. Eww, that's not on the nutritional label.Downside? Soap and cleaner aisles, car salesmen, and that girl at the club will all overpower your with disgusting perfume scents that you are no longer just 'used to'. Cheap bread will taste like chemical cleaners. You'll realize that you taste Dawn on your parent's dishes and in all the cupcakes and cookies they keep making with the kids and good luck getting the blue stuff out of their kitchen. Upside? You can finally realize your SO smells darn good, improve your relationship! Plus the asthma thing, big upside there. I sampled several others and this is the best soap. I've been using Kirks for better than 2 decades, there's nothing wrong with their original but I prefer the fragrance free, and buying them in bulk saves me money and I don't have to go to the store. I remember this soap from my childhood.  Mother used it all the time and shampooed her hair with this soap and not a shampoo product.  I don't think this soap will disappointed you. If you try it I think you'll purchase it again and again. The soap works well.  Highly recommended.I decided to write a positive review for something, since I received two other products that I considered to be not so good products.  Thus, i decided to say something good about a different product to balance out my reviews. I have ordered the fragrance free soap in the past and it had zero smell to it - no fragrance or even a soapy smell. It was wonderful!  The latest box of 12 fragrance free soap smells like soap, which I cannot tolerate. The labels still say fragrance free, but the soap inside each is not fragrance free. Unfortunately since I opened it, I cannot return it so it’ll be donated and I will look for a different place to buy soap.Update:  I found the exact same soap locally, and it is indeed fragrance free with no soap smell. I must have gotten a fake product on Amazon, which seems to be happening to me far too often lately. I wanted a bar of this soap to try making laundry soap.  Before I could get around to doing that, I wound up using it in the shower.  The lather from this bar is different than the Oil of Olay soap I've been using for lord-only-knows how long.  The lather bubbles are much smaller and there are about a bazillion more of them packed together.  It makes the lather SO SOFT and it goes all over without having to use tons of the bar.  I was VERY pleased when I rinsed it off and my body felt all ""squeaky clean"" like the liquid castile soaps that I have used before.  It makes me not want to use a washcloth so I can get the full effect.  I don't feel a residue but I want to wash with it more because I love the feel of this lather.  I like the clean smell of it and the natural look and feel of the bar.  I found it in 3 packs at my grocer and it is now in regular rotation with the liquid tea tree soaps.  I'm getting better at going more natural in my skin care products and this was a good choice for me.  Knowing how soap is made helps too, it's basically lye mixed with fat and then cured.  The fat here is coconut oil which is pretty much the best fat ever for everything from cooking to lotion or hair care.  A reviewer said to unwrap and store the soap so it can cure more, that is correct.  Really good soap gets better when it cures longer. I got sucked in to buying a $100 sampler of that trendy sas-squatch brand...meh.  This stuff though....is....AWESOME!  Sent, lather, works on hair and beard, squeaky clean.  No wonder they've been around for 150 years.  Last soap I buy."
532,B000XTBEY4,"I have gray hair and this product makes it sparkle. I've used this product before and loved it. However, the one I ordered was not the one I received. I wanted the Shine On in the silver can as shown in the picture, which states it works with heat. I received the one in the white can, doesn't state it works with heat, and it doesn't. The Shine On in the silver can works great with a flat iron. I've ordered the silver can Shine On from another site, and received the wrong one...again! Perhaps, they don't make the original anymore, in that case, it shouldn't be shown as representative of the product. Works great on my hair !I love the biosilk products, and before I discovered this I was using the Biosilk serum. But, because I have such thick hair I was told that serum only makes my hair appear thicker. Also I felt like my hair almost became immune to the serum.I started using this because I found it on Amazon and I love it! The fact that its a hairspray makes my hair feel light and it makes my hair shine but it doesn't make it look greasy like most serums.The only con about this product is that it runs out very quickly if you use it every other day.I would recommend this if you have frizzy thick hair I cannot use this product as it will not spray I color my hair a lot and needed something to help with shine and overall healthy look. This product definitely does that. It also smells great! Everyone keeps asking what do I have on that smells so good and come to find out it is my hair they smell every time!! This shine on spray works good! I spray just a little on my waist length hair and it gives it a pretty added shine.  And this smells soooo good!! A nice addition to my hair products :) This product is just OK - It does give your hair a shine, but it also makes it too soft. I have been using this product for a couple years now and it seems to be getting harder and harder to find.  I am glad you carry it, I wish it was offered on subscribe and ship."
533,B001ET7EE6,"I found no fault with it!!! I really like this product for sensitive skin. Purchased this for a skin condition my husband had that we had tried a lot of different things on to no avail.This has worked great for him, and his skin is not near as dry and scaly as it was.My only complaint is I wish it came in larger sizes so maybe the price would be a little cheaper. good product delivered on time Repeat customer Great product When I was growing up, anytime my brothers and I would  have a rash or some kind of skin Problem , My mother would use pHisoDerm on us . I have not been able to find pHisoDerm  for years, I have psoriasis and have broken out pretty bad lately . For  some reason I went to Amazon and typed in pHisoDerm  and it came up to my surprise . I purchased three bottles and as you can see by the pictures after one use my neck and chest was almost clear, it say’s face wash, but I used it everywhere.  I am so happy and will continue to buy. Just as I remember as a child and teen. Silky smooth, cleans effectively, leaves face silky smooth. Not oily and not dry. In fact little bumps on my face has seemed to disappear. No scrubbing, gently rub a little around and rinse well. It arrived in great time and in good shape. I will buy again. I  have so many allergies that my skin is just taken a beating in the last 50 plus years.  I went to my mother and asked her what she used to use and she said this immediately.  I am so glad I found this old friend.  It helped to rehydrate my skin and allowed me to feel clean and moisturize every day.  I highly recommend this to anyone with as many allergies as I have,  Pets, Grass, Trees, Bees, Perfume, Flowers, Fragrances, Plants Medications and so on and so on."
534,B001EGP680,"For my eyes I like the price and goid CUALITY I started using this in Jan 2012.  I am a native Floridian and had alot of sun damage in the form of uneven skin tones and dark patches. I began with the entire line, cleanser, rapid serum, strengthener, intensive complex and eye repair, then added the NIA sunscreen and scrub in March.  I saw results within months. I still have some of the original eye cream, it was just easier to use the intensive recovery all over.  When that was all used, I continued to use only the sun screen. Spots have not returned.  However, I am getting ready to order more of the strengthener for the winter since I don't really need the sunscreen everyday.  If I had unlimited income I would still be using the cleansing line, and may again.  Love the smell and feel of my skin - even before lotion.  However, Cetaphil still gives me non-drying non-irritating cleansing that it has for 30 years and it's alot more economical, beside I always use some type of lotion after cleansing.  The strengthener is 5% pro-niacin and lighter than the intensive or eye cream. I tried putting my daily facial sunscreen over the strengthener but too much lotion.  That is why I added the sunscreen when daily sunscreen became necessary in March.  The sunscreen is only 2.5% pro-niacin but priced accordingly.  It was better than eliminating the pro-niacin or sunscreen.  I also tried the decolletage lotion at 2.5% pro-niacin for spots on chest and hands but did not see results.  Could be that I did not use consistently enough and/or because I wash my hands or get them wet often. I had a plastic surgeon suggest this line to me years ago, about 8 or 9 years ago, and I started w/ the just the moisturizer and sunscreen as that and a wash is all they had at the time.  I loved it!  When the eye-cream cam out I was very excited to try it, so I did and I love it as well!  Very, very moisturizing!  I use it at night, but not during the day.  It's a bit too heavy for me during the day, but at night I'm asleep and don't notice it.  When I wake in the morning, I can still fee the moisture around my eyes. It's pricey, but worth it!  A little goes a long way.  I have very fair, sensitive skin and this is a good product for me! The product works immediately. Not sure if all of my wrinkles or puffiness disappears but I have not had a bad reaction. This is a great eye cream.  It works.  Goes on easily and is very gentle but you can feel it is there.  Softens fine lines for sure and I have tried many eye creams and will be using this forever.  I especially like that you can see it works.  There are many nice eye creams that feel nice but you do not see improvement.  This one does improve.  Nothing is a miracle but if a product improves or does what it says it will...................... that is a keeper.Lasts a long time. You only need a pearl size amount for BOTH eyes. One of the best eye creams I have ever used, and I have used a lot of really expensive ones.  Recommended to me by my dermatologist. It really moisturizes your eye are and it helps a lot with puffiness and dark under eye circles. I first bought this at a plastic surgeons office, the staff loved it.  The first jar I used did not go far, you tend to use more than suggested to feel like it covers the upper and lower eyes.  Thought I would try it again but I noticed immediately that the jar I purchased at my doctor's office was sealed with a sticky tab and the one I purchased online did not have that tab on the jar lid.  One other thing that concerned me was the temperature it sat in outside until I got home that evening from work.  The cost savings was nice but it still bothers me that it wasn't sealed and I wonder if the low temps that day affected the product."
535,B00068CG3U,"This stuff works. It leaves my skin really smooth and fresh all the time. I usually have dry skin around my T-zone, from the moment I used this product it definitely got rid of the dryness. I would highly recommend this. Philosophy is the best skin care product for the money I've used this forever and when I saw the $ I thought it was a steal. However, I misread the 4 fl oz. I read it as both items were 4 fl oz. when each item is only 2 fl oz. Disappointed for sure. But the product is great. It really leaves my skin incredibly soft. I’ve only used it twice so far and my face feels so soft. This product is amazing for my skin! Three times and I feel like my skin is glowing for real. I had lots of sun this summer and this scrub has sluffed off the top layer of sun damaged skin seriously diminishing any starting wrinkles.  If you’re questioning if this will help your skin , the answer is YES! It will help all skin types.  It will also last a long time.  Very little is needed each time you use it.  I count down the days until I get to use it again.  I’m about once or twice a week. This product is very nice, but I have yet to be convinced it's worth the high cost.  I've used it twice so far, and my sensitive skin has handled it easily.  No ""peel"" occurs, but a gentle exfoliation that does leave my skin feeling insanely soft, and my lines diminished; since I'm 46, and my skin is in good shape, with no acne or scarring, I'm not sure how extreme the results are supposed to be; I'd say they are subtle.  I certainly see an increased radiance, as if I've gotten a really great nights sleep, and had all the water I am supposed to drink on a daily basis :).  If this is the desired effect, then It's doing it's job, and I believe I will purchase this again as I'm able to.  I will probably space out the used more often than some people might and intersperse my other exfoliation products which are less pricy.  Also I should note, I leave the mask on for more than three minutes, and in my target zone (forehead) where I have some lines, I do more massaging of the products; this does provide a more intense result than the recommended 3 minutes, and I've had zero trouble.  It's overall a very pleasant product with a nice orange smell, and I've had no unpleasant burning or irritation.  My cousin recommended this to me, and she loves it; I believe her recommendation is correct. This stuff is similar to a discontinued Olay Regenerance product.  Absolutely love this for use after doing a retinol treatment. Your skin will be So smooth! Better than a OTC peel or any other facial scrub. Takes a little practice to get the good system down so you don't feel like you're using too much. It was a bit of experimentation. I feel like I'm going to run out of the liquid sooner than I will of the grit. I do really appreciate what it does for my skin though it makes it look like I was out in the sun for a day or so and I do notice my skin is much smoother it almost feels as if there is a protective layer on top. I use it about twice a week sometimes three and it's been about a month. I'm a little discouraged with the price but I got to say I do appreciate the results. I guess you got to be rich to be beautiful"
536,B001ET704A,"This product saved my life. Ok, maybe not my life but my skin and that is incredibly important to me. This is truly a miracle product without the strong prescriptions and bad side effects that may bring you. Forget the expensive face washes and facials, phisoderm can CURE ACNE. Not long ago, I couldn't walk out of the house without any foundation on. My skin was full of scars, acne, and blemishes. I was becoming hopeless and depressed because I couldn't find anything that helped but at the same time I didn't want to give up to prescriptions. My skin became so bad that I even started putting on a face mask and gave the excuse that I was ""sick"". I changed to a healthier diet, slept more, detoxed, facials, name brand face washes...you name it, I've done it. And nothing worked.After much research and reviews, I came upon this product on amazon and read the great reviews it has for this product. I thought I'd try it out but the low price and the fact that its not sold in stores made me hesitant about its effectiveness. And I was so wrong. After a month, my skin was CLEAR. Not only did it get rid of pimples, but it prevented them from forming as well. I don't know how phisoderm can be so effective at such an extremely low cost and low popularity. If everyone with acne problems started using this, they wouldn't have to see the dermatologist anymore. They would also save a bunch load of money.I cannot emphasize how much I love this product. It is definitely a cure for those who have acne breakouts, blemishes, and a better self-esteem. Do try this out, you won't regret it. I used to break out quite a bit before I started using this face wash and now I barely do anymore, the 4 pack is very useful and I've had it for a few months and I'm only on my second bottle (and I use it everyday). Its very gentle and I always moisturize afterwords because personally my face is a bit dry when I'm done washing (but that might be because of my skin type) but overall I recommend I started using pHisoderm in 1979--and I am still using it!  I can't find anything better, and certainly not at the price.I had acne as a teenager, and in 1979, at age 25, I still had acne.  Of course, I tried different products, but none of them worked.  Then I stumbled upon pHisoderm, and it was THE answer for me.These days--at age 56--I still have skin that is inclined to break out, so pHisoderm STILL works better than any other product.  I did try to change, just for variety, but nothing worked.The reason pHisoderm is so excellent is because it gets rid of acne, and it does not dry the skin out.  It is really good for the skin.It's unfortunate that the company isn't too concerned with selling the product, as they did back in the 70s when it was available in gigantic glaring green bottles, was white, and had a medicinal smell :-)  Every generation has to have a ""concept"" of what's healthy.  Back then, it was the medicinal smell thing :-)After that, it changed bottles, again, but was still white, and available in big sizes.Then, the entire packaging changed, again, to what it is now -- small (dang) -- and clear -- the modern version of ""good for your skin"" concept.So, of course, I recommend this product highly for all ages.  It cleans the skin throughly, preventing acne, gently, without drying the skin.I just ordered myself a nice pack of 4 that will keep me going for a while. I got this because I have been wanting to free myself from Proactiv since I started it. I have been using it for a week now and have seen quite impressive results. This product does not contain benzoyl peroxide which although quite effective for acne, seems to dry out your skin on your face and also bleaches your clothes. It has a mild pleasant fragrance and does not dry out the skin.I use in conjunction with the Foreo Luna 2 for men and they agree with each other quite nicely. Apply twice daily for best results. Although if you are compulsive about washing your face, it will not hurt to apply more frequently. Phisoderm has always been marketed to people with sensitive skin and has along reputation of making products for such skin types. It is very gentle yet cleansing. I would recommend it to anyone.One more thing, I haven't used Proactiv now for a week and am still free from breakouts so I am a happy guy. I've struggled with moderate-severe acne for YEARS. I have very sensitive combination skin, and I've tried everything from Proactiv (which made it worse) to Neutrogena (which worked for a while, but not well enough). This face wash is the one I've stuck with the longest, and although it isn't a miracle cure for my problem, it has helped me the most.It's very gentle, but still able to remove all my makeup at the end of the day, and it doesn't over-dry my skin. At night, all I do is wash my face with this and I'm done. In the morning my face isn't dry and peeling as a result.I'd recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin and moderate acne as a very hopeful solution to your problem. I haven't written or recommended any other face-washing product for acne because I haven't found one good enough until pHisoderm."
537,B000Z8YTMW,"I have never written a review because nothing usually impresses me enough.  But im making myself write one for this because i read all reviews before purchasing anythng on Amazon and i want others to be able to read what i have to say about this. This is probably going to be a little long- but its my story. So im going to write it.Im 33 and have had terrible skin since i was in gradeschool- thats right- gradeschool.  i started getting bad acne before the kids around me even knew what acne was.My skin flakes, peels, breaks out in random places coninuously, blackheads, whiteheads, those nasty cyst types.  Blotchy, dull, flakey, oiley, irritated- the whole misreable shabang.Ive tried EVERYTHING over the course of my life.  Antibiotics, probiotics, detoxing in all sorts of ways, vegan diet, raw diet, magic potions and lotions.I can only remember once in my life when my skin was clear and beautiful- it was when i was 22 years old - for about all of 6 months- when i decided to start an all natural, mostly vegan, mostly raw diet (coming from a life thus far of the typical american diet). At that time i had found this soap at a shop i was buying my organic produce at and bought it on a whim. Lots of things changed for the better for me as far as my health goes- but also- my skin miraculously became clear, soft, and glowing. Skin i hadnt seen since i was a child.Now, for about the first 6 months of this lifestyle change- i used this soap but always just attributed the skin change to the diet- because so many other things bettered with the diet. So i eventually switched from the soap to washing my face with oatmeal, honey, coconut milk, and other such simpler homeade cleansers assuming they would only mae things better- Which then began the descent into my previous battle with my skin.10 years went on of me yet again struggeling through no matter what diet, no matter what lifestyle, no matter what magical all naural or unnatural potions- terrible, unruly skin.I was researching MSM when i came across this soap again last month..and was like- 'oh yeah, i remember that soap'- and fond memories of that time in my life when i was all eager and fresh and new and motivated to get my life in control came back.  And the memory of that clear beautiful skin...and thats when it hit me...was it the SOAP that made my skin do that?  and not the sugar free organic diet i told people for years cleared my skin that one fateful summer?  ...surely not. I mean i LIterally have been telling the story of how canging my diet cleared my skin for years- even though i had no proof to back it because my skin went back to the way it was.  I just assumed that i always ended up reintroducing something bad or that something was ust off and i had just the perfect combnation of foods and activities then. NEVER did i think it could be soap.  I mean that went against everything i believed about what we put IN Our bodies.  A SOAP coudlnt possible reverse what an entire lifetsyle change could....right?Its so affordable- lets give it a shot.2 weeks. TWO WEEKS.  thats all it took to be transported back to that breif time of beautiful skin.It WAS THE SOAP!!All this time i struggled when i should have just stuck with this soap. Im not a fan of bar soap.  Its drying and makes my skin feel raw or tight or leaves me flaking (even though i have incredibly oily skin).  And i always read and heard that bar soap is bad for your skin.  So i just stay away from them.  But this little miracle bar is made of magic.  Im guessing its the MSM. Im guessing that MSM is just exactly for whatever reason EXACTLY what my skin always needed?  Thats insane to me and wierd and a mystery.  That back in the day i would question and research more upon.  But At 33- after such a struggle- i dont care anymore.  Im going to never ever stop using this soap.Not to mention it smells so good.I can actually wash my face twice a day with this stuff- which i normally cant do with anything without irritating my skin or causing a build up or dryness. I let it sit on my face a minute or two as instructed on the box (it sometimes tingles when you do this- which i was super weary of because anything that makes my face tingle usually give a bad reaction or just creeps me out- but there are no chemicals or nasty ingredients in this and i never have a bad reaction so i rest easy) and rinse off- and pat on a ltle of my normal face oil while my face is still wet and let it air dry.I saw results the second day- my face was soothed, calm, and already began clearing up.  By a little less than two weeks- my skin- for the first time in YEARS- was com-plete-ly clear.  Soft.  Even toned.  no rough spots.  No flaking.  No acne whatsoever. None. Im running my fingers over my face as im writing this and feel nothing but sfot smooth skin.  Not a single little bump.If my story sounds familiar to you- buy this soap. So great for acne or other skin conditions! Love this soap and never want to be without it! Looks old falling apart in pieces in box this can’t be new not a happy customer .will try to find somewhere else now I love using this soap. It really moisturize the skin and leaving it feeling so soft. I used to buy this soap in the pass and the bars were so much larger for the price. Way to expensive to be so small. I love the limited ingredients and the lovely orange smell.  I am 43 have oily, acne-prone skin and while it is normally not too bad, this summer I started having more breaking out than usual.  It started with a ""nest"" of black heads on one side of my mouth around my smile line.  I am used to having black heads on my nose and chin.  It took awhile to get them to work out.  Then in the Fall, I got more on the other side and then started breaking out with pimples in the same areas and my chin.  I am used to having the occasional break out that may take a week or more to clear up, but this was non-stop.  After lots of research, I decided to order this soap and some MSM cream.  Both have helped.  I leave the soap on for about a minute and it has helped pull the black heads to the surface.  My skin is now in much more control again.Another thing that was going on were small pustules right on the edge of my lips and corners of my mouth.  After telling my mom about that, she told me to stop using regular toothpaste, especially ones with whitening ingredients.  I had been using some whitening mouthwash for a few weeks, so I stopped that and switched to a natural toothpaste without Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in the ingredients (JASON).  Just thought I'd mention that in case someone else has the same experience. Update: it's currently march, 2015...2 years since my 1st review on this product, and I STILL use and love this soap!***************************************Original review: First off, let me say everyone's skin is different so an all miracle product will not work for everyone. That being said, this product works amazingly well for me! I am fair (but tan easily) skinned with blonde hair. I have combination skin...oily T-zone on my face and at the nape of my neck and shoulders. I began breaking out when I was 30 and pregnant with my twins (boy, did those little boogers screw up my hormones!). I am now 34 and i have tried every natural soap out there, which has left me with the same result...dry skin! This MSM soap is amazing for my combination skin! I have been using it for 3 weeks now and i see a noticeable difference everywhere! So much so, that I ditched my Alba Botanicals pineapple enzyme facial cleanser for this bar of soap! Don't get me wrong, i have never had ""terrible"" skin, but this soap has left me with almost no breakouts (none on my face and few on my shoulders) and extremely soft skin, like a baby! The smell is a light citrus orange and it lathers really well. when the soap washes away, my skin feels a little squeaky dry in the shower but an hour later i find myself rubbing my arms because they are so soft! I just love this stuff! This soap is amazing.  I used it for years and just searched for it hoping to find it again.  This is great for both face and body.  Good for sensitive skin and moisturizing (I live in a dry climate).However, the price points aren't so great.  Almost $9 for a hard of soap that goes rather quickly? And the pay even more per bar if you buy the 3-pack?  Buying in bulk is supposed to drop the price, not raise it. very soothing and moisturising soap, use it for face mainly makes good body soap too, nice mild fragrance. Excellent product"
538,B0009R5B8A,"The fact that bottle content has gotten much smaller but the cost is higher is discouraging.  May have to find a different product. It works good on my dry skin and still has the familiar scent, even though it seems stronger. Gift Very moisturizing A lot of money for a small amount of mineral oil with scent. Also it needs more that the button provided to spray. Can’t grip the bottle when the cap gets oily. Needs a trigger type spray bottle Moisture and insect repellent I have used skin so soft bath oil for 30 years and it is still the same nice scentand silky feeling to the touch. The spray bottle is an add bonus, I love it. So much money for a small body"
539,B00143UYPS,"I have extremely dry skin due to an illness and a nurse recommended a drugstore body lotion that's full of preservatives and chemicals, and it worked, but I'm not spreading that stuff on my skin. None of my mostly natural lotions were cutting it, but this one absolutely does. It's rich and creamy, absorbs quickly, and keeps my skin soft for more than a day. It is the best I have ever tried. I can always add a drop of essential oil or my favorite scent to it if I feel like it, which I love. Truly one of the best body lotions I've ever used. I have been using this product for a long time now, and keep coming back to it.  It has a mildly fragrant scent (which I love!), and it sinks into my skin quickly, without leaving any visible white film or greasy layer.  According to my trusty app that shows ""dirty"" ingredients , this lotion comes near perfectly clean.  I would highly recommend, and will continue to love this lotion. This product was recommended to me by a friend who also went through chemo. I have used it for 2 years and it works the best- no scent, no irritation, goes on smooth, absorbs quickly.  My skin changed so much , have been extremely happy with it. Sa much as I liked my previous moisturizer, the chemicals were irritating me in treatment.My only problem was the pump just wouldn’t pop up this last time, so luckily I had my old pump and just switched- I use every last drop- even cutting it open towards the end :) I love this lotion, and have been using it for years. Product quality is still excellent. Packaging is not excellent. The past 3 bottles I purchased have had pump dispensers that do not unscrew to pop the plunger up into position for use, or just do not work. Again, the pump doesn’t work properly on this bottle I received.Disappointed and frustrated. I've loved this lotion for a long time but the new yellow bottle is so hideous I cannot have it out in my house or buy this product again, so disappointing I bought this for one of my daughters as part of her Christmas gifts.  She has very delicate and sensitive skin.  This is the best moisturizer for her.  There's no scent and it soaks in quickly. If your looking for a good lotion that softens your skin and keeps it soft!  You'll love this one!! Amazing moisturizing!!! Kept my skin amazing the whole brutal winter!"
540,B001HSYSWU,"I bought this years ago and I never used the whole bottle. Expect it to be very small, but I used it to make nail oil pens so it was plenty for about 5 and the bottle is still mostly empty. I don't know if it expires but I assume it doesn't. Great product overall. This is an awesome, light oil for natural hair. It doesn’t build up or cause flaking. Lately, I’ve also been applying it to my skin. It’s all around good. I bought this to put on my face while using my dermawand. Jojoba oil is as close as you can get to the natural oils your own skin produces; therefore, it makes a great product for your face. If you had dry skin a little if this oil at night would do wonders for your skin. It also comes right off with just a facial wipe or a hit wet washcloth. This bottle may seem small but I've used it about 7 times and barely any is gone, it will last a long time. The price for this amount of PURE jojoba oil is great. Use this on dry cracked sjing or a moisturizer at night. You can everln put it in your hair after you wash it as a leave in conditioner/detangler, it helps with split ends and dry over processed hair as well. You can also put a few drops in your bath water as an all over body moisturizer. This is literally like liquid gold. As it becomes harder for us to harvest jojoba oil the prices sky rocket so the cost of this is amazing. This oil is a really great product.  The size is small but it go’s a long way. I used this oil for over a month now because of all the great review that I read and it does live up to its name.  I used to have very dry flaky skin and lots of moisturize that was ineffective.  I used about 2-3 drops at bedtime after washing my face and one drop mix with my regular moisturized for the day.  My face feels so smooth, fine wrinkles decreased (I'm only 30 so there wasn't that much to start but improvement still noticeable), and soft.  This is only a 2oz bottle and I wish I bought a much bigger size to save money because I used for my hair, a daily moisturizer for my skin and nails.  My nails so much thicker and stronger as a result. I'm new to essential oils, so I'm just learning what to expect. This oil seems a little thin, but maybe it should. It  doesn't have a weird scent. It seems well processed. My skin loves it, which is great because I have a ton of skin allergies and sensitivities. (In fact, that's the whole reason I'm turning to a more natural skin care regimen.) The price was very low, and it was delivered in perfect condition, quickly.Incidentally, I also purchased Almond oil (from a different vendor) and it caused some dryness and irritation. If you're new to essential oils, play around with your carrier oils until you find a good fit. delivery was vry quick. Packaging was very secure. 2oz for the price was very good. I purchased because oil was recommended becuase of being light and obsurbing well it does both I use on my face and body. This has many uses I still need to try on my hair. I aslo use to remove my mascara which is water proof (much better than baby oil).I really like it so ordered more but could not find larger size in this brand. If I see this brand become available in larger size and the price is right I will order again I bought this for my stretched ears, and for future ear stretching. Great for dry spots on skin during winter too. Feels good on the skin.  It good quality. Just wish it had a different lid like a dropper or something so it'll be less messy. A Little goes a long way."
541,B00005375C,"I thought it was a hand cream so the tube is trigger than expected. Good moisturizer though. I really like this product. I have used it for quite a while now.  I did receive the wrong size tube initially, but the seller made good on it and gave me a refund. Would highly recommend. None I bought this when looking for a lotion for my face, but when it came it was just a body lotion. It works well for the body, but nothing special for your face. I don't like a lot of scent, so this was nice. All Aveeno products have been excellent products that I use frequently. My problem with many lotions is that they dry out quickly. This lotion is rich and creamy but not greasy. I also use the shampoo which is awesome. The softness and protection last a long time even if you wash your hands it still feels good, as if the lotion protected your hands from the soap and water. I love this lotion for my face and hands but also gives me relief if I have a itchy problem like sometimes my knuckles itch and my ankles. But I apply this lotion and I am instantly relieved. A great product but a complaint about the tube. As you use the product and it is, say, less than half full, it becomes harder and harder to squeeze it out of the tube, especially when you have the moisturizer on your hands. The plastic that the tube is made of is too hard to handle and you can't fold it up (roll it up) they way you can with toothpaste. Nor is it as strong as some other brands so you can easily squeeze w/o needing to roll it up. Listen, I'm an old geezer with very dry skin and I produce more dander than Pig Pen! With that said, I tried this product because I was literally out of options besides going to see an overpaid and overpriced Dermatologist. I'm glad I didn't go see a quack. I tried this product without any real expectations, however it was recommended by a lady friend, so I went for it. Within 10 days of daily use after bathing, my skin issues were gone. Dander.....gone. Feel better, absolutely! I'm no longer itchy from dry skin and it is truly nice to use a product that works. It's not greasy and doesn't feel like Elmer's Glue, go I give it five stars because it really works! I'm a 53 year old woman....combination dry/somewhat oily T- zone, rosacea, few fine wrinkles.  This lotion is the best for calming your skin....which mine easily blotches after cleansing or in sun.  I apply lightly under my makeup (after applying my Roc products...which I recently discovered and are amazing).....wait a few minutes, dab face and my makeup glides on.  Moisturizing without greasy/look or feel.  I also convinced my 35 year old daughter to try this product, she loves it as well.  She has problems with cystic acne for years due to Cushing's Disease and wasn't comfortable using a moisturizer.  I explained that very dry skin can cause your body to overproduce oils to compensate....thus more acne.  I hope this detailed review may help one person on the fence."
542,B000GR7KCS,"The product arrived just as pictured and closed securely.  No leaks or spills.  I have to say, ONE OF THE BEST BODY WASHES!  The smell is amazingly soothing. A nice fresh flowery fragrance that lathers really nice and leaves a good clean feeling! It performed BEYOND expectations!I have other body washes that are just as good in other fragrances and brands. They are work really good and smell good. It just depends on my mood in which one I choose to bath in.  This one is definitely one of my favorites!I actually have 2 favorite aspects with this body wash.  The first being its texture.  It is light and does not leave any residue on the skin like I have felt with some other body washes.  The second is THE SMELL!  It captures the smell of a Lily perfectly! I'm not sure of the authenticity of it smelling like a waterily, but it has a very similar smell to an actual Lily and I LOVE IT!I don't think there are any improvements that can be made to this body wash. Except, NEVER STOP MAKING IT!  You cannot go wrong trying this AT LEAST once in your life! Wow! I don't typically leave rave reviews about anything. This is it..body wash. I've finally found a product that clears up my face! I've been battling acne/breakouts since I was 13 years old, that's almost 20 years. Who knows how many cleansers, medications, and various other acne products I've purchased trying to clear up my skin. Lately it's been Proactive, which sort of works but is harsh if used too much.I started using this Ivory Aloe body wash about 2 weeks ago on my face with an exfoliating washcloth and warm water, and really I can not remember the last time my face was this clear. If you over do it (wash then rinse too many times), like any soap, it will make you a little dry but I use a very thin layer of Ponds face lotion afterwards. Not even expensive Proactive products worked this well on my face. No more harsh Benzoyl peroxide​/​Salicylic acid scrubs, finally. I liked it so much after the first bottle I ordered the 6 pack and an additional bottle to send to a friend. Seriously, if I could buy this stuff by the gallon in case it ever gets discontinued, I would. Aside from the help with my acne, it's made my skin very soft. Smells good. Feels more natural and pure than those dyed, perfumed, chemical body washes that I'll never use again.Definitely 5 stars. I first purchased the Ivory Lavender Body Wash (24oz Bottle, Pack of 6) on October 27, 2010 for $11.35 and again on December 28, 2010 for $17.85.  On August 27, 2011, my bill was $27.62 and as a result, I discontinued my Subscribe and Save orders because the price has almost tripled since October 2010 to the amount of $30.80 for the next shipment.  When I spoke with a representative on this matter I was told the website indicated that the price of an item may increase or decrease.  I am amazed that the price increased so drastically in last than a year.  It has become too expensive to purchase even though I like the product as indicated by 4 Stars. my review is only in comparison to the same brand in the green aloe bottle.  This lavender one seems to leave the skin very dry - the aloe leaves it smooth and moisturized.  This one also smells only lightly of lavender and actually very much like unscented ivory liquid soap - dish or body; I know this sounds funny and unfair but I'd swear it is cut with plain ivory soap.  Maybe not, but either way, its strong and not very lavender'y.  The box was labeled as if it was the original factory box just like the aloe, but no partitions - just the bottles rattling around standing up loose.  I'd think they'd have partitions or some other packing to stop them from rattling around.  Don't know  just seems funny.  But the soap cleans well and is nice and sudsy.  I'm going to review the aloe as well - that one I love During my pregnancy I had a relatively rare skin condition that caused my skin to blister on contact with just about any kind of product you could imagine.  It was torture to shower or apply moisturizers (as the dermatologist recommended).  It took me months of trying different products to finally find a handful that were gentle enough on my skin and this was one of my very favorite.  I still use it now years after the condition subsided.Why this is fabulous:- nonirritating to super-sensitive skin (at least in my case)- has a very gentle, pleasant fragrance- leaves a clean non-greasy feeling on the skin- moisturizingHighly recommend. Love the smell. Wonderful bath soap. Ivory Soap has always been a favorite of mine, so for that reason, I am not completely disappointed in this product.  The only complaint I do have is that there is not particular aroma to the supposedly scented body wash.  I was so excited that Ivory had come out with a scented product, but then, no real scent.  Otherwise, I still like this Ivory Body Wash and use it every day,  I just can't give it a Five-Star rating. I am so sick and tired of all the local chain drugstores that carry only one or two major retail lines of body wash that are JUNK!  Full of garbage that settles and looks disgusting in the containers, makes me break out in hives and smell so bad I wouldn't use them.  But good ol' Ivory makes a terrific non-irritating, pleasant smelling body wash WITHOUT THE HARMFUL INGREDIENTS.  Could find it in CVS for a short while, then they too went over to only carrying the MAJOR brands - why?!  Thanks to Amazon I can get my favorite products - YEAH!!!!!"
543,B0011UWXM6,"This is the absolutely best sugar scrub I’ve ever used!! Received it as a gift and after using ordered more for my self and some as gifts for others! I just love it!!! The best part is the smell. It's really chocolate. Another good part is that it is moisturizing and easy to rinse. I wouldn't say I like product which is stick to my skin while rinsing. With this point, it is high endorse. Pros: turns sandpaper-like skin into touchable skin, smells good, can be used on sensitive skin, gets rid of bumps on the back of the upper arm, no animal testing, 100% vegetarian ingredients, has several certified organic ingredientsCons: expensive, hard to find locally, does not last long, amazing smell does not linger, may be too moisturizing for someone with oily skinI have been buying this and only this scrub for several years now. Over the years I have tried many different scrubs from St. Ives apricot scrub to $20+ scrubs to my own homemade concoctions. This is by far the best scrub I have ever used and the only store bought scrub I am not allergic to. My skin type is: very sensitive, dry, and prone to redness. Also, I am sensitive to fragrances and chemicals. I used to be able to buy this scrub locally (for around $13) at Whole Foods, Publix, and Walmart but they all stopped carrying it. I am lucky this product is sold on amazon (and for a much better price than it was available for locally) and dread the day it will no longer be available because it is the only body scrub I can use really. This scrub has small exfoliating sugar crystals and smells amazing. I wish the chocolate fragrance lingered a bit. This scrub is warming when used which is likely why it is called ""hot chocolate"". Some of my skin (mostly my stomach) turns a little red at first after use because of the warming effect in conjunction with the rubbing of the sugar crystals across my skin. This chocolate scrub actually helps keep away bumps I get on the backs of my arms. I love this scrub and would recommend it to someone with my skin type but not to someone with oily skin because it is likely too moisturizing. I do not, however, recommend the mint lemon salt scrub by Giovanni to anyone with my skin type at it is extremely drying, which may make it an ideal scrub for someone with oily skin. I love how smooth my skin feels after. I love this scrub! I’ve been using it for years. I only use it as a foot scrub in the shower but it feels wonderful & I love that it warms up slightly. The smell is also my favorite because I love chocolate haha. Always have this available to use because it just makes me feel happy! I do have pretty sensitive skin but this doesn’t irritate it at all. The scent is like hot chocolate. It's a great scrub that doesn't make a mess in the tub. I have fairly sensitive skin and I love this stuff. I love this stuff! The scent is like decadent, rich, velvety smooth fudge. The sugar and crushed cocoa beans are just abrasive enough to slough away any dry patches your skin may be plagued with, yet gentle enough to keep even sensitive skin from harm. Most skin scrubs are so crumbly that when scooped into your hand, a lot of the product drops onto the floor of your shower. Not so with the Giovanni scrub. The consistency of this product is almost gel-like. The exfoliants are suspended in a this gel. It does not slip off the skin as soon as your hand smooths it on, so none of the product is wasted. I've tried products similar to the Giovanni Sugar Scrub, and nothing compares.  My showers suck without this stuff! Although Giovanni Sugar Scrub is a bit pricey, the quality of the product justifies the dollar amount. (One 9 ounce container should last one person about 2 or 3 months.) FYI.... During hot summer months, add a few drops of peppermint essential oil to this scrub. It smells just like a York Peppermint Patty, and the coolness of the mint makes your skin feel refreshed and tingley! I can honestly say this is the best body scrub I have ever used!! It is amazing and smells so delicious and feels so invigorating and leaves your skin so very soft and moisturized."
544,B0000532YN,"I've tried many different bar soaps, shower gels and creams and have found this one to be the best at moisturizing my skin. It lathers up quickly and rinses off leaving my skin moisturized but not sticky. It also works well for shaving and does not dry my face like most shaving creams do. It has a subtle ""earthy"" scent; I know that some reviewers have said that they do not like it, but for me the scent is not detectable after rinsing the soap off. The 8oz bar lasts me several months with daily use and can be heated and cut into smaller pieces if it is too large to handle in the shower or to travel with. I have been using this soap regularly for the past two years and do not plan to switch anytime soon! What an excellent bath soap for those looking for a product of the most basic of constituents and with excellent attributes.  I continue returning to purchase this product because of its capacity to clean effectively without harsh chemicals. You don’t buy this soap for the scent, it smells like olive oil which isn’t bad or good, and the smell doesn’t stay when rinsed off. You buy this soap because it’s the purest, healthiest soap on earth and it’s great for any skin type or season, gentle enough for very sensitive people, keeps your skin ph perfect-so it’s safe for feminine areas, and it makes you look young and fresh because your skin will be the healthiest ever. I don’t even need lotion anymore, because it never dries you. When you go all-natural for the first time some people have a transition period where your skin detoxes, but I’ve been using this soap for 10+ years it’s worth it. Also, keep it dry when not using it so get a soap dish with spikes and put it to the side of the shower stream. Then it lasts longer too. Natural soap always liquifies easily but it can be dried and used again if you accidentally leave it in a puddle. Bought this for my 1 yo who has EXTREMELY sensitive skin due to eczema and severe food allergies. (Coconut oil breaks her out in hives for crying out loud! ...which is why we wanted to try this olive oil-based soap.) It did not work for her. I tested the soap on the back of her shoulder in a 2 in circle at bathtime and in 24 hr she had red, dry skin in that spot. No good. However, still giving it 5 stars because it works really well for my face scrub! I have very sensitive skin that also becomes dry/acne prone when a product is too harsh. I've noticed my skin is becoming even dryer in my 30s -- e.g. cetaphil is a little drying for me even though it didnt used to be. I use this green bar of soap (which is quite a humongous size!) with my Olay ProX every day and my skin feels very clean, but not tight/dry. It seems that it scrubs away all the dead akin so that my moisturizer can really penetrate and keep my skin soft and looking good all day. The soap smell is not awesome -- i keep it in the cupboard under the sink in our bathroom but when i leave it out on the vanity it smells up the whole room and my husband thinks it smells ""weird."" It does not leave your skin smelling strongly of it, thank goodness! For most people with sensitive skin, I highly recomend this product. For those, like my little one with extremely sensitive skin, we'll stick with a diluted apple cider vinegar bath and the occasional use of Aveeno Baby eczema cleanser. I have a 17th century oil painting which I cleaned with this olive oil based soap in preparation for the Antiques Roadshow. The soap worked very well for this purpose, though it didn’t give me the $1M value I was hoping for 😂. Bonus - it’s also a great soap for hands/face. Dear Amazon Shopper,There's a lot to like about this soap.  It contains no suspect ingredients, has a pleasant (but not overpowering) aroma, applies smoothly and comfortably to the skin, and offers a great per-oz value compared to other ""natural"" soap offerings which often carry puzzlingly stratospheric price tags.  As of this review, for example, Burts Bees bar soap runs $1/oz while this soap run just under $0.40/oz, making Burts Bees two-and-a-half times the price while offering no discernible advantages (other than the bars being half the size).That being said, each bar of ""Kiss My Face"" soap is garishly large.  These half-pound behemoths sport a level of unwieldiness that one typically does not associate with soap.  It takes some doing to lather up with one of these monstrosities until you've weathered it down to a more manageable size, making this a suboptimal choice for people with back problems or who have trouble with fine motor control (you really need to grasp it for the first few washes, since it's unnatural largeness makes applying it to the skin a shade awkward).  I half-suspect that ""Kiss My Face"" accidentally ordered a mold designed for bricks rather than bar soap and decided ""meh, we'll just go with bricks.""If you've got large hands, you'll probably be very pleased with this soap straight out of the wrapping, otherwise, you can always slice it into four 2oz quarters, which will really bring home just how much soap you're dealing with.  At $25, if you're looking for an inoffensively-constituted soap that gets the job done (well), then it's hard to go wrong with this offering.These are huge, serviceable bars of natural soap that are more likely to break your back than your bank.Thank you"
545,B0017QSUXK,"I received this only 4 days after ordering it!  I took away one star, because it's not quite as brown as I expected from the other reviews.  Most people said that it's not orangey at all, and I found that it did have a slight orangey color to it.  Not bad at all though, just not as good as some spray tans I've had.  There definitely is NOT the weird chemical smell.  Apparently it's also paraben free which is great, and VEGAN, for folks like me.  Better ingredients, better product.I have an in-between skin color.  I'm not fair, or olive... I can get pretty tan, but I do freckle a little bit, and get pale in the winter.  I didn't want to waste money on the Light tones, so I went for the medium.  It's November, and I'm definitely NOT tan right now.  I used this stuff last night before bed (which you really aren't supposed to do, because it might rub off on your sheets), but I was excited, and went ahead.  I can tell a pretty significant difference this morning.  I left it a little too concentrated on my for-arms, and have a line that looks kind of orangish.  My legs and everything have a nice glow to them though.  Because I'm so pale right now, I probably should have gone with the one for light tones, and I doubt I would see this orange tone.My advice, if you're like me, not olive- not fair, a little freckly, and very pale from lack of sun, you may want to get the light tone.  Especially if you have some important even coming up that you want to look really natural for (like wedding pictures or something).  If you just want to reduce that winter pastiness, then by all means, this is a very delightful product.  It's moisturizing, and smells good.  I don't know if it would work on the face well.  I wish someone that had tried would post.  I had some self-tanner for the face by Jergens, so I used it.  It stinks :(, but I didn't want to wake up like an oompa loompa.  Good product, give it a shot, just for the shear stink-lessness. Let me just preface this product review by saying...I have been using Jergens Natural Glow for over 5 years ...(the Medium tone which is a perfect shade for me). Now, this product is NOTHING like the Jergen's product... This one is more CONCENTRATED. I can apply a thin amount on my arm, and minutes later, I'm looking at an arm that would have taken me 3 THICKER applications of the Jergen's...(it's a given, that we are all have different skin types and tones, so what I describe is my own experience and others may have a different outcome or may think I'm exaggerating in some way.) I am very naturally pale, white skinned, so in my mind, using a self tanner, helps me look more 'alive', and less, drab. LOLOkay, so I have found myself having embarrassing conversations with various people in my life. All because I am not use to this product, and/or think it's similar to the Jergen's product...I'm just writing this to detail some of my experiences, that were somewhat embarrassing....#1: At work: I've ONLY had to explain, after doing a ""RUSHED"" application of the lotion, on my way to work & fresh out of the shower (I'm not 100% dry, because I'm in a hurry)... I end up with streaks that I can't see sometimes, like on the back of my arms.I found out, when I heard some whispering from co-workers...and then one of the ladies, taps me on the shoulder and says ""What is that? Are you okay?"" They thought I had some sort of skin disorder...#2: I'm with family members, I relax, with shorts on, and lay on my side... After two minutes mom says ""What are you doing to yourself?""...before I can answer, she's touching my lower ankle, ... caught off-guard, I stumble to answer, it took a while before I figured out it was my self tanner,and not my boyfriend abusing me (And no, he doesn't, LOL) (awkward conversation.)#3: I get my blood work drawn regularly for medical purposes. The phlebotomist preps my skin before drawing blood with an alcoholic swab...and the poor old lady gasps after rubbing my veins and looks at the brown color. (uncomfortably awkward).#4: It's freezing temperatures overnight...(not too common here in Houston)...So, I procrastinate in washing makeup off my face because it's ice cold water, ...I pass time by reading perfume bottles on the counter, and occasionally running my wrists into the tap water...by the time I look back at the water in the sink, I panic!!! OMG the PIPES must have burst with the freezing weather...All I saw was dark rust colored water! I woke up family members, saying Our Water is coming out BROWN!! Took 3 minutes before I figured out, ...Well, here goes another fine moment, when I must explain, Nope, it's just this NEW Tan lotion I'm using, and not use to...No, it's not our pipes bursting because of the below freezing temperatures outside, yup, awkward... Sorry, go back to bed everybody! LOLThere is a few other conversations I've had with a significant other, but I'll spare the readers the details. LOL. You get the picture...just be extra sure to be dry, and if using on your face, you have to do some EXTRA exfoliating, as it tends to roll right off my face if I don't exfoliate first...Despite the embarrassments and explanations, yes, I will purchase this product again, and yes I recommend it, I just need try the lighter shade next time. :P I like this self-tanner more than any of the other ones I've tried.For a while I was using lotion with a little self-tanner in it, and that did the job but wasn't great, I wanted a little more color for the summer. I tried this based on the good reviews, and I'm glad I did.Now, this is a self-tanner, not a lotion with a little tanner in it, so it will leave you streaky and splotchy if you don't use it right (exfoliate, put it on evenly, let it dry).  But after nearly a week, I'm very happy with the results. The first day was a little rough; I didn't exfoliate well enough, and I had some streaks.  The second day I scrubbed really well with the bath pouf in the shower, and that seems to have fixed the problem.  A little goes a long way, and while this bottle will definitely not last a year, I could see it lasting at least a month or two with daily use, which is more than most self-tanners.  And for being relatively un-chemical-y, it's a good price.I love the texture; it's a nice, thick lotion that actually moisturizes too, which is great.  The smell is really nice, too; I don't smell it every time, but I get whiffs of almost a baby oil type smell.  It's very light, and not even a little overpowering.  The tan seems to have built over a few days, and I'll likely start alternating between this and my regular lotion pretty soon.Overall, I can definitely see myself continuing to use this lotion long-term.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is I wish it wasn't in a pump bottle; I can never get all the product out of those."
546,B0017OLMVE,"For what I pay for the product is overpriced for amount you receive. It does work, works well. Try it for older skin.  Great under light foundation or alone Never disappoints as usual 😉 Like I said she loves it and happy wife happy life. This product gives facial skin a smooth appearance. This really works.  Pores in my face are greatly minimized using this product. I used this product for years and it is just perfect for me. Now it is difficult to get in Israel so I ordered it through Amazon. however, the delivery agent, DHL, is doing a very bad job with the local distributor. A pity. This lotion will make your skin great again."
547,B000H9C1UG,"Update: I just received my second jar and noticed that not only is the jar much larger (same volume of product though) but it has an added ingredient. This product now contains Co-Q10. If you have purchased before I feel like it is good to note the new add-in.Quick Review of THIS product:I love the 20% concentration. I have used 5% and 10% creams and 40% and 70% peels. The 20% glycolic acid cream is perfect for my aging skin now that I'm very used to having acids on my skin all the time. This cream doesn't burn as much as the 10% and that may be due to the added antioxidants (even though that doesn't make sense). I wear this cream almost 24/7 now because it isn't drying like previous creams/peels and it doesn't interfere with my makeup. I forsee using this cream for a long time and my skin is already greatly improved. My skin texture is like porcelain. Love it!My complete journey with glycolic acid creams/peels:Okay, I started using various acids on my face several years ago. First I tried lactic acid and realized I'm allergic. Then I found a glycolic/salicylic combo that turned me into an acid fanatic (okay that sounds bad). I soon moved on to Skin Obsession's 40% glycolic acid peel liquid. I loved it but it made my skin really dry for days and older looking for about a week due to the dryness so I couldn't use it regularly and using it around my eyes where I had fine lines I wanted to knock down before they turned into deep wrinkles, was scary to say the least.Then I discovered Reviva Labs 5% glycolic acid cream at Ulta. It was mild enough to use every day and it really improved my adult acne. My breakouts were less frequent and the zits I did get healed much faster. I soon moved up to the Reviva Labs 10% cream when my skin got used to the 5%. The 10% took my skin to another level of smoothness and the dark marks leftover from a lifetime of acne were starting to fade. I used the 10% cream and the occasional 40% peel regularly for nearly 2 years. My breakouts were nearly a thing of the past and I really only got hormonal acne. I'm pretty sure I haven't had a gargantuan zit or cystic zit since I started using the 10%.I then started mixing my own percentages of ASDM Beverly Hills 70% glycolic acid peel with water to get about 50-60% acid peels. The ASDM is actually far less drying than the 40% even though it is a higher percentage. Not sure why but maybe my skin is just really used to acid peels now.About two months ago I decided my skin was in need of something stronger to really get rid of my deep discolorations, pits and uneven aging skin. I went to Amazon again and searched for something that looked promising. There were a lot of 15% creams but I didn't want to increase a measly 5%. I wanted 20% or higher. And then it happened. I came across Topix Pharm Glycolix Elite Cream with 20% glycolic acid AND antioxidants. I noticed a difference in how my skin felt after my first overnight application. I woke up with smoother, more hydrated skin. My skin seemed to be more clarified and I debated whether I even needed makeup (I did, I still wore it and I still am... cream isn't magic). I have now been using it for almost 2 weeks and I am sooooo happy with my purchase.My skin is very smooth now so when I put on even a little bit of my makeup, I look flawless. When I removed the makeup, my skin has more of a plumped up glow to it. I don't look as sallow as I used to. This cream doesn't burn AT ALL but that may be due to my being use to the acid. It does sting for a few seconds if I apply it right after I do my thrice weekly face scrub (my favorite time to apply). Overall, this product is definitely going to be in my beauty rotation for a while.New update in Nov 2018 after years of using acid treatments:I am still using this 20% cream but now only about 2 times a week. Why? Because my skin is awesome now. I am not at all embarrassed by my skin texture, spots or pore size. I can leave my house and run errands or workout without feeling like I look gross. This cream keeps my fine lines away and helps with dryness so I do still use it but not for the same desperate reasons as before. This cream and all my acid treatments have really saved me from a lifetime of skin issues. I now get to focus on moisture more and I have stopped doing scrubs all together as they are more abrasive than this cream so I let this cream do the exfoliating. The lotion is thinner than I expected, requiring more applications during the day. This is an excellent product with 20% glycolic acid. I could really see a difference in my skin after using this cream. I would definitely order again. N/a I use this once a week as part of my home facial treatment. It takes years off my face. People ask me how I look so young and I tell them it’s thanks to this. 週に一度、自宅でのフェイシャルトリートメントの一環として使用しています。顔から何歳も若返ったようです。どうしてそんなに若く見えるのかと聞かれますが、これのおかげだと答えています。 I have very resistant, oily  skin so I’m always looking for “the big guns” to see results. The “tingling” lasted for about 2 weeks and that was using it twice a day. I’m noticing fewer pores which  is resulting in smoother texture. Not a very big jar but a little seems to go a long way. This cream works as described. I can recommend this product. I love this resurfacing cream!I don't have a problem with my skin other than dryness, but I use this resurfacing cream three or four nights a week to keep the skin on my face as smooth as glass and to keep uniformity of tone.This is a gorgeous, luxurious cream. It's definitely a cream and not a gel. I double cleanse my face, use an enzyme peel, then a hydrating toner, a stem cell serum and a vitamin C serum. Then I seal all that in with this resurfacing cream.The cream glides on easily, and though it's easily absorbed, it's also moisturizing. (Since I have such dry skin, I sometimes use a light moisturizer as well after the cream is absorbed.)If you're not used to glycolic creams, you might not be able to use this every night. It might feel a bit irritating. It made my skin feel a little irritated in the beginning, and I don't have sensitive skin at all. That's okay. If you use it only three nights a week, it'll still perform it's magic.Be sure to wash this off in the morning! It wouldn't be healthy for your skin to leave it on all day. And while you're incorporating this into your beauty regimen, be sure to use sunscreen. Glycolic acid makes your skin far more likely to burn.For me, this cream is the magic that gives my skin that glass skin look. In other words, perfect. And it's so luxurious, I feel like I've been to a spa.I don't know anyone this cream couldn't help. Some people have better skin than others for a variety of reasons, but none of us has perfect skin. We can all use a little more help.This is one product I want to have in my beauty arsenal forever."
548,B0000Y3D4Q,"I have used Rezamid when needed over many years. It works quickly when I have break outs on my face. It keeps its potency for about 18 plus months and you only need to us a little. It truly is a great product and price wise it is about the same as a prescription and maybe less depending. It used to be prescription only. So glad it is not as it saves a trip or call to the dermatologist.The product also came pretty quickly! I have had acne prone skin since my teenage years. Now in my 30's I don't have cystic acne or anything remotely close to the problems of the past, however I still get monthly breakouts and occasionally clogged pores. I started using rezamid close to 20 years ago. It was initially recommended by a dermatologist I was seeing at the time. I love mixing a little bit with my neutrogena skin clearing foundation and using on red areas and blemishes. The coverage is fantastic. A little goes a long way. I wouldn't use it by itself because it is too drying and dark for my skin. I am fair skinned and I have never used the liquid that comes with it in order to darken the color since it is plenty dark enough. The coverage is so much better than foundation alone. Often I don't even need to use a concealer. Mixing it has worked for me all these years and I feel like it really helps dry out active blemishes. The smell takes a bit of getting used to, but it's really not that big of a deal. Make sure to shake it very well before applying. I think it's great and I'm happy this product is on the market. It's helped me feel a little more confident throughout the years dealing with less than ideal skin. This is a surprisingly good product for something I'd never heard of. I suddenly became allergic to the benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid I'd been using since my teens so I was so glad to finally find a decent alternative. It really does dry out oily skin and any acne practically overnight, plus it also seems to sooth redness. My skin is fair so I didn't need the tint to match my skin color but I don't know that I would use it during the day anyway because it's kind of flaky and not great as a makeup substitute or for applying makeup over. Also, because it is so drying I usually apply it, let it dry(which it does super quickly- as in you better spread it around  your face quick) to give it a chance to work and then use a good basic moisturizer. Still, as drying as it is, my skin is never as dry and irritated as it was with benzoyl peroxide and Rezamid doesn't bleach my hair and sheets. Without using the tinting this product is fantastic. I sometimes spot apply (on cystic acne) it at night after washing my face but I usually apply it via an airbrush makeup gun (diluted with one drop witch hazel one drop sterile eye saline solution) each morning after washing face and applying a very thin liquidy moisturizing serum. It is fantastic. My acne has all but disapprared. It's a perfect primer if allowed to dry a few minutes (fast) and sometimes I just cover with a powder foundation.If I want more coverage I spray my airbrush foundation over the sprayed on rezamid .Don't be mistaken, this sounds like heavy makeup, it isn't. It's nearly undetectable yet gives perfect medium coverage. The bottle doesn't indicate or claim SPF properties but it contains zinc oxide and I've noticed, even in Las Vegas or So Cal summers it, coupled with powder foundation SPF 12 has provided adequate (no sunburn) protection with 90 min outside Love that there is 5% sulfur, 8% gets stinky. Resourcinol (sp?) Is the best thing to heal skin! Wish there was higher percentage of that. It also gives it a good tint. Didn't have to use the tint they include bc I have fair skin. I wish it wasn't so pricey, but compared to Accutane, this stuff is a gift from the gods! Is like the old RA lotion I used to get at the pharmacy. It's thinner than Glytone, but covers scars and scabs well without feeling ""cakey"". Forever changed! Please don't take off Amazon!!! It's the only thing that works for my cystic adult acne. It also heals and shrinks other types of pimples. <3 this stuff! Scar on my chin healed so fast. Photo is of my skin without makeup and without the Rezamid for coverage. Only 3 days of using on a HUGE cyst! I have used this great lotion since 1962. In those days it required a prescription and cost $2.50! It is wonderful for acne. I occasionally get a pimple in my ear ... Too much listening to audio books, I guess. Nice warm environment for infection. Anyway, after using this med for over 55 years, I feel qualified to recommend it. It is especially good for cystic acne, bringing the pimple to a head overnight, so it can be drained with a sharp needle and then medicated to dry it up. I hate that it costs so much in today's world, but it does work fast. No color matcher included. The product was very clumpy and dark orange like the color matcher was already mixed in the bottle. Box and bottle were not sealed. I have purchased this item directly from Summers Labs in the past and this product looks nothing like it. I will not be purchasing from Amazon in the future. I've tried almost every skin treatment on the market: Retin-A, benezoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, antibiotics, light treatments, natural remedies, etc. Rezamid is the only product I've tried that has made a huge difference in how my skin looks. After using Rezamid consistently for about 6 months, I barely ever get blemishes- and the ones I do get heal very quickly. The key to using this product is consistency and quantity- use it often and use a good amount. It doesn't smell the greatest, and the coloring it comes with sometimes dries oddly on your skin, but it's worth giving it a shot. Be patient and use it every day and it's likely that you'll see results too. Highly, highly recommended."
549,B001ET7IQK,"I recently started using Dove unscented soap bars and I am so happy with my purchase. These soap bars are perfect for anyone who has sensitive skin or is sensitive to fragrances.One of the best things about Dove unscented soap bars is that they are gentle on the skin. The soap is moisturizing and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or tight after use. This is especially important for me since I have dry and sensitive skin that is prone to irritation.Another great thing about these soap bars is that they are unscented. This means that they don't contain any added fragrances that can irritate the skin or trigger allergies. I appreciate that Dove has made an effort to create a product that is inclusive of everyone's needs.In addition to being gentle and unscented, these soap bars are also long-lasting. They don't dissolve quickly like some other soap bars, which means that I don't have to replace them as frequently.Finally, Dove is a brand that I trust. They have a long history of creating products that are gentle and effective, and their commitment to inclusivity and diversity is something that I appreciate as a consumer.I highly recommend Dove unscented soap bars to anyone looking for a gentle and effective soap that is safe for sensitive skin. They are moisturizing, long-lasting, and free of fragrances. Dove is a brand that you can trust, and these soap bars are a great investment in your skin health. I’ve used a lot of natural soaps, and found them drying and irritating. I’ve used this soap for years now and find it the least drying and irritating, and I’m also sensitive to scents and love that it’s unscented. I totally love Doce soap for sensitive skin and the moisturizer This is the best moisterizing cleansing bar of soap. It gentle from your face to feet. It appears that the Dial Basics Hypoallergenic bar soap is no longer available.  Tried this one - the Dove Fragrance Free, Hypoallergenic bar soap.  I like the Dial version better (and it's rectangular shape) but this is a very close replacement and can confirm that it is in fact fragrance free and very mild. No dry skin anymore!! Have to use unscented hypoallergenic soap.  None of the stores I shop at has it anymore. I knew I could count on Amazon. Now the itching will stop. Large package. Well worth the money. Excellent soap, cleans well and leaves no residue on your skin."
550,B000YTGT6Q,"I use this as a pre-shampoo scalp oil.  I've always used hair brushing as a first step to brush up the dandruff and spread my hair oils, but now that my scalp is drier I don't feel it is enough.  I also have some itchy scalp that really only goes away for a week or two immediately after I dye my hair.  I don't actually know what that's about, but this oil takes care of it.  No more itch.I was worried that it would fade my hair dye as I've had trouble with even ""color safe"" shampoos immediately revealing my grey roots even just a week or so after dying.  This oil does not lift the color in any way.  It is truly color safe.After brushing my scalp I part it and with the oil poured in one hand use my oil-dipped fingers to spread the oil on my scalp.  (A dropper would be WONDERFUL!)  After going all over my scalp I then massage it in as though I am ""shampooing"".  This works as a kind of double cleanse for the scalp.  Just as cream makeup removers get stuff off your skin that ordinary soap can't, this scalp oil breaks up product that perhaps ordinary shampoo doesn't.  I then leave this on for 15 minutes to an hour as I do think the herbal properties are doing good things for my circulation and are strengthening my follicles.I haven't used this long enough to address whether or not it stimulates hair growth, but I wouldn't be surprised.  My scalp feels so fresh and clean and it and the hair near the roots LOOKS fresh and soft.  It is a bit more effort to do this ""pre-cleanse"" but I feel that it's worth it both in terms of short term cleanliness and calming of scalp issues and, hopefully, in terms of long term hair health and beauty.I love Weleda's purity, reputation and fair pricing compared to similar items.  This is very good value for money. The first and major ingredient in the Rosemary oil is peanut oil. Read the ingredients list. I love the smell of rosemary but in this item, the rosemary scent disappears in about 60 minutes, on my skin, or in my hair. However, a small dab of this stuff smoothed into my hair does help with my dry hair frizzies. Weleda has an amazing marketing program and I find myself drawn to their products due to that marketing, however you must read the ingredient list to see what you are really getting, and what you are paying for. I have been using this Hair Oil for years.  My hair is very thick, very coarse, wavy/curly, unruly, very dry, very fizzy, and a tad grey.  It is shoulder-length.  I do color-treat my hair.  This oil can be used on color-treated hair without a problem.  I love this product.  I use a lot of it.  My hair craves the moisture this oil provides.  Right after a shower, before I towel dry my hair, I turn my head upside down and use a generous amount to squeeze through my hair starting with the ends. Then I wrap it in a towel.  Within 15 minutes, I take the towel off, and with my head in a normal position I finger style my hair and then add another generous amount to the top layer of hair throughout my entire head.  Then I let my hair air dry.  When I used to worked, I would blow-dry my hair every morning and use a flat iron to straighten it.  The hair oil was a huge help in keeping it straight all day long.  But now I live in a humid climate, and I lost the battle with humidity.  So now I embrace my natural curls and waves, and the hair oil keeps them from fizzing up.  It's a perfect solution for me.  Some people have written that the oil changes the color of their grey hair to green or yellowish.  I have never had that happen top me.  I highly recommend this product. High quality, pleasant natural fragrance, nourishing hair oil for healthy hair and scalp! So the conditioner is squeezed out and looks like toothpaste.  Its super thick so you have to kind of emulsify it in the palms of your hands before applying.  It smells really spicy kind of like the Aveda products if you have ever used them.  It also kind of has a musky overtone as well but its very pleasant smell.  When you put it in your hair your hair needs to be really damp and you have to gently smooth it down the strands of hair.  It is not a type of conditioner you can just rinse and go.  You have to let it sit in your hair a bit then gently comb it in.  If you are looking for a conditioner with lots of slip this isn't it.  If your hair tangles and has tight curlys  this isn't it.  This conditioner would be great for someone with straightish hair maybe slightly wavy on the normal to slightly dry side.  I didn't notice any itchy feeling on my scalp and I have a super sensitive scalp.  It leaves a bit of build up if you don't rinse it well.  I wouldn't use it as a cowash as it needs shampoo to remove any excess.  Since it is a heavy conditioner it kind of attracts smells to your hair because of the oils in it so I noticed during summer I have to wash my hair more.  I don't think I will repurchase but I do love the smell of it as is kind of spa like, IMO that is the best part of the conditioner. I’m a big fan of Weleda products and after using the shampoo, I wanted to try this conditioner. I love the very natural scent, it’s delicate and similar to essential oils, or herbal tea. I have fine and thin hair, so keep in mind, it will work differently on other hair. It has thicker consistency, a bit thicker than Greek yogurt, or think of a thicker facial crème. So, if you’re used to a more liquid consistency, this may take you some time to get used to. My hair is approximately shoulder length and I use a decent amount on my hair, minus the scalp. I sometimes add just a couple of drops of water to work the conditioner to a more liquid state and apply to my hair. I leave it in for about 5-10 minutes. I found that it’s easier to rinse and run my fingers through my hair afterwards. My hair feels soft and smooth. I either let my hair dry naturally or I put it in satin rollers. I will purchase this product again. If you're thinking of trying this brand/conditioner and are switching from a commercial conditioner, it may take you some time to readjust and like this product. Try using a small amount of this conditioner and a small amount of the one you're currently using, and see it that works out better. Otherwise, you can check and see if it works as a leave-in conditioner."
551,B001E6O8WU,"I've tried many different bar soaps, shower gels and creams and have found this one to be the best at moisturizing my skin. It lathers up quickly and rinses off leaving my skin moisturized but not sticky. It also works well for shaving and does not dry my face like most shaving creams do. It has a subtle ""earthy"" scent; I know that some reviewers have said that they do not like it, but for me the scent is not detectable after rinsing the soap off. The 8oz bar lasts me several months with daily use and can be heated and cut into smaller pieces if it is too large to handle in the shower or to travel with. I have been using this soap regularly for the past two years and do not plan to switch anytime soon! What an excellent bath soap for those looking for a product of the most basic of constituents and with excellent attributes.  I continue returning to purchase this product because of its capacity to clean effectively without harsh chemicals. You don’t buy this soap for the scent, it smells like olive oil which isn’t bad or good, and the smell doesn’t stay when rinsed off. You buy this soap because it’s the purest, healthiest soap on earth and it’s great for any skin type or season, gentle enough for very sensitive people, keeps your skin ph perfect-so it’s safe for feminine areas, and it makes you look young and fresh because your skin will be the healthiest ever. I don’t even need lotion anymore, because it never dries you. When you go all-natural for the first time some people have a transition period where your skin detoxes, but I’ve been using this soap for 10+ years it’s worth it. Also, keep it dry when not using it so get a soap dish with spikes and put it to the side of the shower stream. Then it lasts longer too. Natural soap always liquifies easily but it can be dried and used again if you accidentally leave it in a puddle. Bought this for my 1 yo who has EXTREMELY sensitive skin due to eczema and severe food allergies. (Coconut oil breaks her out in hives for crying out loud! ...which is why we wanted to try this olive oil-based soap.) It did not work for her. I tested the soap on the back of her shoulder in a 2 in circle at bathtime and in 24 hr she had red, dry skin in that spot. No good. However, still giving it 5 stars because it works really well for my face scrub! I have very sensitive skin that also becomes dry/acne prone when a product is too harsh. I've noticed my skin is becoming even dryer in my 30s -- e.g. cetaphil is a little drying for me even though it didnt used to be. I use this green bar of soap (which is quite a humongous size!) with my Olay ProX every day and my skin feels very clean, but not tight/dry. It seems that it scrubs away all the dead akin so that my moisturizer can really penetrate and keep my skin soft and looking good all day. The soap smell is not awesome -- i keep it in the cupboard under the sink in our bathroom but when i leave it out on the vanity it smells up the whole room and my husband thinks it smells ""weird."" It does not leave your skin smelling strongly of it, thank goodness! For most people with sensitive skin, I highly recomend this product. For those, like my little one with extremely sensitive skin, we'll stick with a diluted apple cider vinegar bath and the occasional use of Aveeno Baby eczema cleanser. I have a 17th century oil painting which I cleaned with this olive oil based soap in preparation for the Antiques Roadshow. The soap worked very well for this purpose, though it didn’t give me the $1M value I was hoping for 😂. Bonus - it’s also a great soap for hands/face. Dear Amazon Shopper,There's a lot to like about this soap.  It contains no suspect ingredients, has a pleasant (but not overpowering) aroma, applies smoothly and comfortably to the skin, and offers a great per-oz value compared to other ""natural"" soap offerings which often carry puzzlingly stratospheric price tags.  As of this review, for example, Burts Bees bar soap runs $1/oz while this soap run just under $0.40/oz, making Burts Bees two-and-a-half times the price while offering no discernible advantages (other than the bars being half the size).That being said, each bar of ""Kiss My Face"" soap is garishly large.  These half-pound behemoths sport a level of unwieldiness that one typically does not associate with soap.  It takes some doing to lather up with one of these monstrosities until you've weathered it down to a more manageable size, making this a suboptimal choice for people with back problems or who have trouble with fine motor control (you really need to grasp it for the first few washes, since it's unnatural largeness makes applying it to the skin a shade awkward).  I half-suspect that ""Kiss My Face"" accidentally ordered a mold designed for bricks rather than bar soap and decided ""meh, we'll just go with bricks.""If you've got large hands, you'll probably be very pleased with this soap straight out of the wrapping, otherwise, you can always slice it into four 2oz quarters, which will really bring home just how much soap you're dealing with.  At $25, if you're looking for an inoffensively-constituted soap that gets the job done (well), then it's hard to go wrong with this offering.These are huge, serviceable bars of natural soap that are more likely to break your back than your bank.Thank you"
552,B000S97MAY,"This is a great eye-cream!! Did like fact that go a leaky jar Sorry- I wrote a review on the wrong product- very great value I from now on will only order this product directly from Kiehls… My second time ordering this off Amazon and I was a bit sketched out when I got it. I opened the package and it was slimy and covered in what I think was the eye cream. What was odd though is the seal wasn't broken. So I'm not sure why it was covered in the residue. The eye cream also is very runny and thin. Almost liquid. Disappointed because the first time I got this off Amazon it was in great condition and the texture was more creamy. Es muy bueno lo recomiendo 👍 I have an eye cream infatuation. Going into my eye cream background would be like reading a biography on my them. Let's avoid that. I'll say I had my fair share and my problem would be a decent mild case of darkness around my eyes and dryness creating some fine lines. Right after receiving my purchase and applying it that night I noticed an IMMEDIATE difference. Despite what you hear on skin care commercials you never think immediate is really true. My under eye area was quickly plumped up with moisture, leaving it dewy and soft. After the product fully sunk in, my eyes look brighter and much younger! It never made my eyes sting or water. Despite its claim it does migrate into the corner of my eyes making me look like I have ""eye boogers"" (gross yes) and look like I just woke up. Its easily wiped away and a small price to pay! This products texture is odd but cool, you have to apply it to dry skin or it glides right over the surface. I found that odd but hey, I just wash my face, tone, moisturize around my eyes than apply this, unless i'm rushing its dry by then anyways. Also I have noticed I need to apply it maybe later in the day since it doesn't seem as supple after a while. I mean hey the first ingredient is water that eventually gets carried into your body and/or evaporates. Yes it does have shea butter but I found that even unrefined shea butter, for me, moisturizes up to 6 hours before you need to reapply and this is on my body.Despite the mentioned cons, in the long run my eyes began to look better and healthier each day. The kicker for making me keep it was when my mom asked me, ""Why don't you have any lines under your eyes."" I kissed that container afterwards. This eye cream has a sticky texture (like hair clay) and does not apply as easily as other eye creams.  The moisturizing effect lasts much longer than other eye creams I've tried, though, and that's the main thing.  It has a weak scent.  One thing I don't like about it is that it leaves your skin shiny.  Some of the shine will fade away after 10 or 20 minutes, but not all of it.  If you are bothered by shiny skin around your eyes, then look for a different product.  If not, then you may like this eye cream."
553,B001ECQ4WQ,"It is a good product Scent lasts hours I use Dove bar soap, regular scent and nothing special.  I read that this Dove Body Wash Deep Moisture  moisturizes your skin and where i have dry skin i thought i would try this.  Never again.  It dried my skin and left a white powdery coating on my skin.  I was so disappointed and unfortunately I bought a 3 pack of this and I will not use.  The bottles are big and bulky and hard to pour, does not lather.  Dove bar soap I will swear by, but not the body wash. Great price, great smell, love it Very thick & moisturizing.  It makes lots of suds.  Would definitely buy it again I love dove products, they smell great and the shampoo and conditioner products are wonderful to my hair.  You can't beat the original moisturizing dove body wash. Good Fast delivery; as promised!"
554,B000O3UC0Q,"Items like this are the reason I could never be a contender on a show like Survivor.  I RELY on this lotion so heavily that I cannot go a day without.  I struggled with fancier, more luscious smelling brands before picking Eucerin Daily Replenishing up in the grocery store one day, and I have not looked back.  I would like to note that I also tried the other Eucerin offerings, but they, for some reason, didn't do the trick and I would always end up with itchy spots on my legs.  I am a daily shaver so I need something dependable and non-greasy, and this lotion fits that bill.  No good smell coming from it mind you, but no bad smells either... :)  If you're looking for a great day-in-and-day-out lotion, this could be the one for you! I've used this lotion for years on the recommendations of the wife of a dermatologist. I love it. I very sensitive skin so it is perfect for me. And it really is a great moisturizer in any climate. It's light weight on the skin and is easily absorbed so no transfer to clothing, though it doesn't stain anyway, so if you're in a hurry you can dress before it dries completely. I have a case of really, really dry hands that flake, itch, burn, sting, open up and inflame. This lotion does help, but in comparison to the original petroleum jelly/cream base, it just doesn't do the trick. However, it does work out pretty well on my dry skin in general. If you are looking for a better, greasy, slick, and protective feeling, there's always the original Eucerin cream or their petroleum based Aquaphor. I have very dry & very sensitive skin. When I get out of the shower, my skin is calling out for moisture & Eucerin is the ONLY lotion I can use that offers comfort with absolutely no irritation. Eucerin - Daily Replenishing Lotion is light & soothing & leaves me comfortable all day. If I had to live on a deserted island for a year with only one comfort item... this is what I'd chose to take with me. I'm so glad I gave Eucerin, in general, and Daily Replenishing, in particular, another try because now I really like it.  My skin is moisturized yet not greasy.  Because its fragrant free, I can wear my favorite perfumes, colognes & oils. I use the Daily Replenishing as well as the Intensive formula; the Daily is less greasy and absorbs faster, while the Intensive is a repair miracle... so for me they both have good applications.NOTE: I'm one who always compares to save a little money, and often I opt for generic. But not when it comes to Eucerin. I've converted several friends and family members from their brands - it's just really good lotion. Better for daily use than the Eucerin Intensive Repair, which contains alpha hydroxy -- too strong for everyday.  Non-greasy but long lasting.  Its my new standard for lotion, which is important for me since I have to deal with eczema. This is the best lotion on the market and I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin or sensitive skin. I bought this online cause it was 4 bucks cheaper than Walmart. Thx Amazon"
555,B000JVY52Y,"I have never used a scrub before and I am 67 yrs. old. I finally got up enough nerve to get a massage form a professional. BOY, have I missed out . Well she talked me in to a salt scrub at a spa. I was there for 4 hours and I think I left at least 4 pounds of old dry wrinkled skin there. I have NEVER experienced ANYTHING like it. I really and truly felt 20 years younger. After the spa experience my masseur suggested a body scrub and told me to use once a week. I picked this one and it is great. I have got rid of my old dry skin. My skin feels so different. It use to feel rough and old and wrinkled  like a normal 67 yr. old. NOW it feels like a I have taken 30 years off my skin.I have got complements from 3 different nurses. They ask me HOW I did it. One insists it is because of my genes. She does not believe I could have done it myself with the assistance of my wonderful masseur.I know review doesn't say much about the scrub, but  IT IS REALLY GREAT and I like it very much.I just want to say if you are older and a little embarrassed about your body. Even if you are younger, do yourself and your body a BIG favor GO TO A SPA and get the works, especially you guys. You will be thanking yourself the rest of your life. Based off of the positive feedback here, I gave this as a gift to the significant other. I am honestly very disappointed with the product.Just about the only positive about the product, is the feeling after rinsing off. It does help make you feel more clean, but not as much as the description leads you to believe.The scrub doesn't foam up at all. Literally, nothing. For the price of the item, you really need to use a very generous amount just to feel ""clean"". Definitely not worth it, when you factor in the large price. The smell isn't great either. To me, it smells just like black licorice, and for someone who doesn't like the taste, the smell isn't any better either.I purchased through Prime for Valentine's Day, so obviously it arrived on time and all of the other jazz. Amazon did great as usual, but this product just isn't worth it. I'll update the review if I can find a good substitute for it, but I would not recommend this to anyone. This cleanser is for men, but I steal it from my husband to make my skin smooth. More like a gel with salt granules, this can be used as a body wash.The blue gel seems to promote a sense of freedom with elements of lime, mandarin and bergamot for an uplifting emotional appeal. Leaves the skin scented with a refreshing almost grapefruit like fragrance or a lemony cologne. This is a scrub men will enjoy and women will want to steal.The blue color will remind you of your favorite ocean and the salt granules are more smooth than scratchy so this can also be used on the face. This is perfect for when your skin is in an oily or combination mood. This is slightly drying if you have normal skin. Deeply cleansing.~The Rebecca Review I had high hopes for this product but it really fell short in all areas.1. It's not really a scub at all. For me i would like it to be a lot rougher and for you to notice it more.2. The smell i didnt really care for. I mean its not awful by any means but its not that great.3. The price is way to much for this product and its a pretty small bottle also.Overall i would not recommend this to anyone. There are better scubs out there for sure for a lot less money. I liked the scrub I got from this, but the label on the bottle , which appears to  be painted on, began to flake off after a couple uses.  So now every time I reach for the bottle, I have paint chips all over my hand The sea salt in this scrub leaves your skin feeling super clean. I can't use it very frequently since it can dry out the skin, but it's great to use about once a week. The fragrance is very clean, mild, and natural smelling. Anthony tends to make products that are more on the natural side, and totally worth buying. Waste of money, will not buy again.  Not enough ""scrub"", and its supposed to be odorless but has an odd lingering smell. Anthony Logistics makes a fine body scrub here. Nice smelling, no over dried feeling at all. Sadly Ive only found this online."
556,B00028PFF0,"Very mild on the skin. Good product. The scent on these is really unbearable. Cleaning my face This is a great product. I have very sensitive skin and most skincare products either break me out or burn my skin.  I've used this product for the past three months and it has done wonders.  I'm experiencing less break-outs and my skin looks less porous. I really love these pads. Really good at cleaning up any part of your body. I have been a long time sufferer of eczema and these pads do not irritate my skin. Took them on my international trip and they were extremely convenient for on the go use during layovers. Good at cleaning up the oily feeling of sitting on a plane for 10+ hours.Pros: Hold moisture pretty well, very convenient for on the go, cleanses oily skin fairly well. I didn't experience the pads drying up. I expect that as long as you keep the cap on, the pads drying out shouldn't be an issue. I've had them sit on my shelf for 2 months and they still were very moist. Not a strong alcohol smell, very gentle. Girlfriend used these to remove her makeup and liked how they did not irritate her skin.Cons:In my experience, due to the small size of the pads, it does take a couple of them to really all of my face cleaned up. I would not recommended for cleansing large areas of your body. They tend to tear/break pretty easily.Overall:Great product for on the go cleaning your face and travel. Would highly recommend for travel use for anyone. Not meant for large areas of body, would probably only recommend for face or even more private parts if needed... As a cosmetologist, I learned early-on that most facial toners used witch hazel as a major ingredient -- high-end toners! I've been using witch hazel, for years, as an after-wash toner. I use any brand that's on sale. I notice witch hazel doesn't dry my skin out and it rinses away the last cleanser residue from my skin.This is the first time trying any witch hazel pads and I really like them. They are just the right size for wiping down my whole face and neck. The pads are about 2 inches round, have dripping amounts of witch hazel in them, have a delightful rough texture that helps exfoliate (my favorite part) and after wiping down your face (scrub the congested areas) you throw the pad away.  The hardest part of these was getting the screw-on cap off when they first arrived.I am now in-love with witch hazel pads and have ordered other brands to see what their pad material is like. It's nice to have the scrub/rough pad material instead of a soft cotton square that I was using. I remember using medicated pads for acne ages ago and the pads in those, with a rough/scrubby surface, is like what these Thayers' pads have.  Wish there were a tiny jar of 5 or 10 to take along in my purse for freshening up my face after a hot day away from home. I really like the product and it does not burn my fair skin and shrinks my pores. I've always had oily skin but I'm 64 so my skin is not as oily as it used to be. I really like the product and I use it once a day in the morning before I apply any make-up. What puzzle me is I can't figure out why I am now just finding this if it has been around for 170 years! I gave this a try because it was affordable so I hope they stay the prices down. As a first responder required to wear an N95 mask, I have developed stubborn acne along the edge of the mask. Thayers worked well. As mentioned in other reviews, initially your skin is flushed, but it subsides after a few minutes and you are left with clean, soft skin. Cleared up my N95 acne!"
557,B0019CTF36,"I keep a bottle in my bathroom dressing table with a sink.  Looks nice on the counter and works well. Just as described. Well priced. Delivered quickly. I love this soap I love the Dial Antibacterial liquid soap it is moisturizing, scent not too strong and affordable.👌🏽 Can confirm this is soap. Squeaky clean. would buy again. Food pantry need clean hands at all times! Love love"
558,B0011XZZF0,"Great for dry winter weather ...that the secret to her flawless and beautiful skin was olive oil especially on her face. Now, I am not going to go and get my bottle of olive oil and slather it over my face and body (but I have heard that olive oil is a great make-up remover), but I will try some soap with olive oil in the ingredients. So I poured over the many types of olive oil based soap and purchased the fragrance free Olivella soap (3.52 oz).It has been a few weeks now and I have used the soap, mainly on my face, almost every night (even when I was not wearing make-up) and in the shower. Here is my observations:- It is not fragrance free. There is a slight odor. I can only describe it as a peppery olive oil scent. Very light and not unpleasant. However, if you need to have soap that is totally free of fragrance, this bar will not do for you. If you want to smell like you have been romping in a field of fragrant wildflowers, well, you may smell, but it is from being sweaty.- This soap does leave your skin soft, but you need to rinse it off very well because, for me at least, any residue caused me to itch slightly.- I've always had clear skin with an occasional light, pinkish botches showing up once in a great while. I have not seen any blotches since using this soap. I cannot tell you if it help clear any other skin blemishes.- DO NOT LEAVE THIS SOAP IN A NON-DRAINING DISH or on the shelf in the shower. It gets gooey and big glops come off the bar. It helps to some how prop it up so all sides can drain, including the bottom. Do not let it sit in water. It melts and leaves dirty-greenish puddles.- It has been a couple weeks and I am still on my first bar. I am a little frugal with its use due to the higher cost of each bar. I believe that I probably have half a bar left.- This soap softens and removes make-up quite well, although you still need to rinse well and wipe around the eyes a second time with a soft cloth.My plan is to consistently use this soap (I bought a 12 pack) until gone. I will update at a later date. I doubt I will look like Sophia, but I do want to see if my skin remains soft and blotch free. I heard a rumor that olive oil helps fade brown spots. I will report back on this as well. Amazing. I felt luxurious finding this after so many other products had coconut based ingredients. With me being allergic I was wondering why I have never felt relief. Smells not too bad you can definitely enjoy it to an extent. Really just smells like a bar of soap from the past and I don’t mean old, I mean it smells OG classic clean. November 13, 2012 - So far I like the soap very much, although I've only used it to wash my hands.  I plan on using it as my shower soap as I have itchy skin during the colder months, and I'm hoping it helps to relieve the symptoms.  I also have eczema on my hands almost year round, and I'm hoping it helps with this too.  Some reviewers said it smelled ""vegetal"" and did not suds up well.  You can see from my video that it suds up just fine.  As for the vegetal smell, frankly, I'm not even sure what vegetal smells like, but I can say that it smells nice, it actually smells kind of floral.I'll update once I've had a chance to shower with it for a week.Update 2/23/13We have used this soap since November for showering and general hand washing, and I have to say, my eczema has never been better in the last 10 years.  Don't get me wrong, this soap is not a cure for eczema, but I definitely have not battled with it this winter like I usually do, and I do honestly think this soap has something to do with that.  It's a great soap, it smells nice, and it feels good using something that is natural.  Also, it is reasonably priced considering how good it is. I like this soap because it does not leave a filmy, slick residue on your skin like so many other soaps.  I have been using it for 3 years now.  I buy in bulk to save money. Solid bars of wonderfulness. No slimy bottoms. Nice neutral odor and color. This is the best soap bar we've tried. No perfumes or strong scents. Good lather. Pricier than others but worth it. I was buying this soap for my now 97 year old mother. She needed a gentle soap.  Then I developed an allergic reaction to the soap I was using.  I tried several hypoallergenic mild soaps and none of them worked.  Then I thought to try the Olivella.  Perfect!  No reaction at all.  The soap is an olive green/brown color.  No surprise there.  It generally has no scent, although I have occasionally opened bars with a mild odor to them.  I don't like scented soaps at all, but this was not terribly offensive, just unexpected.  The soap will appear to turn your washcloth brownish as you lather up.  It is only soap and it washes out as you bathe.  It does not lather as much as some of the mainstream soaps, but it does lather well and I have no complaints."
559,B000RYLN6O,"My only issue with KINeSYS is that the lid won't stay on and it's a little prone to leaking because of it. The smell is great. The application is easy and effective. The sun protection is good. I have very pale skin, so nothing is full proof for me, but this is comparable with other brands. The lid really is a problem though, especially during travel. I've wasted at least half a bottle to the leaks. I've been using Kinesys SPF 50 for several years now. It is easy to apply, a clear lotion (not creamy/greasy), it absorbs into the skin quickly and it moisturizes. Most importantly,  it does a great job protecting from the sun, just as advertised. Definitely glad I purchased, and will purchase again. I first heard about this brand because it was listed in Allergic Living’s 2020 Top Allergy-Friendly Sunscreens List.  Since my son has severe allergies it has been very hard to find a sunscreen that is free of top allergens INCLUDING coconut.  We had been using Badger Baby on all of us for the last 7 years (because if he hugs or rubs up against us while we are wearing sunscreen with coconut he breaks out) and while it works and has great ingredients, it's also a thick white paste.  So when I saw this and saw that it was free from top 8 allergens, including soy, no sesame, gluten-free, AND coconut free AND cruelty free/vegan AND it was a spray!?!? Well it sounded too good to be true.It's not.  It works.  It's so much easier to put on than the Badger Baby sunscreen.  We can put it on my allergic kid and no rash, we can put it on my 3 year old and no screaming or wrestling.  They can run around outside in the heat and play in the water and so far no complaints about anything running into their eyes and no burns.  We are generally sun-cautious and wear a lot of sun protective clothing and hats, but this works great for the areas not easily covered like neck, feet, hands etc.I will say it is a very small bottle (we got the smaller of the two sizes) but the non-aerosol sprayer is very efficient.  I can cover the full length of both my arms in 3-4 sprays.  I also bought the 30spf for kids in the orange bottle, and the ingredients are slightly different.  The orange bottle doesn't contain homosalate and the percentages of the other ingredients are slightly different.  In terms of application and efficacy though, I don't see too much of a difference between the two other than the spf.  I do like the tiny bottles because they fit more easily into our diaper bag without taking up a ton of space and I can fit one into my smaller purse so that we're prepared for any unexpected outdoor fun.  I would love a ""refill"" option so that we can reduce waste in the future, but for now these should last us the summer. Hate how lotions streak and leave a residue. This is a little oily though, but it works well and I prefer it over any other sun screen. Wish I didn't have to reapply so often, but would recommend this over any others to family and friends. I have a lot of body hair and cannot use creams.  It protects well. It's not at all greasy and I can even use it on my face and it does not sting if it gets in my eyes. I have not found a better sunscreen. I have only used this twice so far, but I needed something that wouldn't burn my eyes, wouldn't sweat off, and wouldn't feel tacky on my skin. This does all of that, and so far appears to work well as a sunscreen.I sweat more than anyone I know, and shave my head. In addition to that, many sunscreens irritate my eyes just by being near them, even if I'm not sweating. So far this is everything I needed.It does take a little while for the skin to absorb it fully, but not long. I may try the 30 next time, as I read that it's even lighter, but this works great. It is better for my needs than anything I have ever tried. The thin pump spray is so much better to use than a cream or aerosol.Honestly, I can't think of anything close, and I've tried many. Highly recommended. Recently tried finding a non-aerosol spray sunscreen that goes on clear because a stupid outdoor festival that I wanted to attend did not allow aerosol sprays for some reason. So I had to find something last minute and quickly. Bought a bunch on Amazon and this was the only one that did its job. It's a bit overpriced but at least it works.I only took one star off for the price."
560,B00014DMUA,"Love desert essence products. This has made my face moisturized and it appears to be helping with acne. This is an awesome moisturizer at an affordable price.I highly recommend! Me gusto mucho se absorbe  muy bien no te queda  grasosa tu piel. Great stuff I have been using this moisturizer for many years. I have normal skin and I prefer unscented  and clean ingredients. This is works very well for me. My skin is pretty sensitive and after using this product, my face and neck felt hot. It had caused red patches of what looked like burns on my face and neck which were hot to the touch. It did go away after about 45 min, but I discontinued the use of it I was so delighted to find this product at Spouts at such a reasonable cost but couldn't find it in stock when I needed it.  Amazingly there it was on Amazon.  I've bought much more expensive moisturizers that didn't perform any better than this exceptional item. A little goes a long way with this!!! You only need a bit when using it, but I do feel like it helps my skin and doesn't irritate my skin at all. I'm not too thrilled about the smell but I believe that's because its made of more natural ingredients, which I don't mind. I would most likely buy this again. I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying this lotion burns their face and blaming it on the sodium hydroxide (LYE). Please don't let this scare you, lye is used in a LOT of products ( esp soaps ) and can be neutralized when it's mixed with oils. Lye is necessary to control the PH of the product and necessary for saponification. If you apply this while you're face is wet you might get that ""burning"" effect, that is the water and oil in your skin reacting to the sodium hydroxide. Just make sure your face is completely dry before use and don't use a lot, a little goes a long way.I should mention that if the formula they used is ""off "" and say they added too much sodium hydroxide to one batch and there wasn't enough oil to neutralize it, that would also cause some unpleasant results.Just thought I would clear this up, I think this product is pretty nice and I have combination skin at age 30."
561,B000H8GPO0,"I always have loved this scent. It lasts for a long time and you smell so clean!!!!!! I’ve loved and used this particular Philosophy fragrance for years because it’s simple and fresh and doesn’t smell like a “loud” perfume. It’s very convenient for me to get it on Amazon and I’ll continue to buy it here. I get many compliments  when I wear it. When I wear pure Grace I receive so many compliments, I just love it This smells so good but the scent doesn’t last. Disappointing for a perfume that’s not that cheap THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENTS, EVER!FRESH, DELIGHTFUL, WONDERFULLY PLEASANT AND APPEALING.WORTH EVERY PENNY AND THEN SOME. Simply amazing fragrance TikTok lead me here and I am not super impressed. It has a clean but old lady smell to it. To me, perfume is a luxury b/c it’s all overpriced. This one is a great, simple, clean scent."
562,B000Q6D3MA,"I really enjoy using this soap.  I like the full luxurious lather.  It cleans well.  Leaving my skin soft. Eliminating dry ichy patches, and is longlasting.  I also like that it rinses quickly without leaving a film.  The scent though nice, it is a little too pungent.  It is not so much that it would keep me from buying more.  It keeps my skin moisturized during the winter when it is so dry because of the heating elements.  Thank you Yardley for such a very good bar soap. I can’t always find it at the store but I love the smell and it makes me feel so clean! I bought 13 bars at once since I like them so much. The Yardley Oatmeal and Almond Bar Soap is a great product that I highly recommend. It has a wonderful, subtle fragrance that is not overpowering and it leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.The oatmeal and almond ingredients provide gentle exfoliation and really leave my skin feeling smooth. The bar soap is long-lasting and I feel that I get a lot of use out of just one bar. The packaging is also nice and simple, making it a great option for travel. I stock up when it goes on sale every so often for less than $1.00.I will definitely purchase this soap again and recommend it to others. It's great for dry and irritated skin. I have eczema flare-ups, especially during the winter and if I'm in a pinch for money or can't go to the store to buy Aveeno this is what I get as a substitute. I love this soup honestly! Every chance I get I buy some. Love the fragrance and how my skin feels afterwards … The soap is very small and finishes too fast. However I like the smell and feels soft on skin It is very drying and your hands have a funny feeling residue on the after washing your hands with it I've been using this soap for many years and was so happy to find it on Amazon at a great price!  The scent is very nice but not overwhelming, and it leaves my skin feeling clean yet soft. I'm sensitive to scents, some give me migraines, but in the years I've been using this soap it hasn't given me any problems yet.  I'm very happy with this purchase."
563,B001G7PJAC,"Is a crazy how great these work for me pull out a lot of dirt Mask wearing has caused acne around my nose area,these help a lot,good product/price Have used this product for years. Great for oily skin. Acne sucks, and treatments differ from person to person. Here is what works for me:I'm an adult with combination oily/dry skin. I've found that using these pads 2-3 times per day as soon as I notice a pimple coming on, will either minimize their potential or prevent them entirely. For those pimples that are very deep and large that take days to surface (the often painful and long-lasting ones), I haven't had much success, and I suppose reasonably so due to the severity of those types. I find these pads to work best for light acne, spot treatment and daily prevention. They can be drying, YMMV, so I have adopted this routine which has been very effective for me over the past several months:1. Early evening: lightly wash face with a clean, soft washcloth, warm water only (never hot!).2. Apply Oxy pads as a spot treatment, full-face treatment or preventive treatment (never scrubbing).3. Late evening: again, lightly wash face with a clean, soft washcloth, warm water only.4. Immediately apply Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Water Gel.**Current Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Hydro-Hyaluronic-Hydrating-Moisturizer/dp/B00NR1YQHM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ROP0ZXO5M1XI&dchild=1&keywords=neutrogena+moisturizer&qid=1592107294&sprefix=neutrogena+moist%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-1I am not an advertiser, it just works for me to re-moisturize my face from the drying that occurs with the use of the Oxy pads. I have also tried the ""Extra Dry"" version of this product, but to me it seems too thick like it might actually clog pores. YMMV. Better to use the regular version more often than to use the thicker version less often.If anyone tries my method above and has success, I would appreciate hearing about it.Cheers!.UPDATE 7/2/20:I bought this 3-Pack about 6 months ago here for $16. Now the price is $26? No thanks, I don't do 40% price hikes. One jar is $6 at my local pharmacy. My skin is so sensitive of late and for me to find an adequate cleanser that do not irritate my skin has been the challenge.I have really dark eye circles and so to find something, anything, that could potentially reverse this sign of aging has been an going obsession.So whenever I get a new facial cleanser my focus area is always right around the eyes. Most cleansers agitate my eyes to the point of being rendered wholly ineffective, because the scent is usually too overpowering and/or the chemicals are too harsh for the eye area.These little pads were great in addressing my obsessed upon area. I was able to adequately cleanse the eye area until satisfied that all the dirt, oil and makeup had been lifted completely from the eye area.My eyes did not get overwhelmed at all. Very gentle cleanser that is also efficient. I am in my 50's and was having acne issues.  I purchased this product and has worked very well for me. Sadly adult acne runs in my family. My aunt just had a breakout at 72! I have been using these for years and they are the only thing that has kept my face completely clear (like at most 2 zits a month.) I have tried other things because these are expensive, but nothing else has worked, not even the salicylic acid face wash which I thought would be the same.You have to use a lot of moisturizer since they have a drying effect. However, with consistent use I've noticed *much less* of a drying effect, while the acne fighting is still good. I have rosacea and salicylic acid is much better than the other acne over the counter med, some type of peroxide. I think these help the rosacea a little bit too, but not a lot.What sucks is that I have to use *a lot* of these pads or the acne comes back. I put 3 or 4 pads together and wipe of my face. Then I wait a few minutes and wipe again with 2 or 3 pads. I do this every night, and sometimes in the morning too if my skin is feeling oily. So if you have an on going acne issue that is bothering you, I encourage you to try using a very high dose of these for 2-3 weeks and see if it helps. My happiness and self esteem really is much better when I am acne free. I just wish the cost was free! Still, for me spending 20-40 a month on this is well worth it.The cost on amazon is much better than CVS or walagreens. I think you can find cheaper at online discount drug stores but amazon is just convenient.PS there are similar pads made by clearisil that are even stronger. If you have bad acne I would actually start with those and switch to this once your skin clears up. The clearisil is more expensive. I swear by this product, I use it twice a day. I just bought a 2nd jar and I will continue to use as long as they continue to make this product. My skin is prone to small breakouts here and there and tends to leave blemishes. I don’t have the worst case problematic skin it’s just a little sensitive. I’ve been using the product for less than a month and here’s what the results look like on both sides of my face. One side is a lot more clear than the other but it has improved a lot as I continue to use. This product actually works I had to she my experience with you all. I hope it works for you as well, my goal was to be able to wear less makeup as possible and just embrace my natural imperfections."
564,B000VL292A,"This is ok. I have very dry under eyes to the point it seems like eczema so this wasn’t for me. I can see this work for others. I was really hoping that I would like the Biotique Almond Under Eye Cream For Dark Circles & Puffiness would work for my dark circles.  I tried it out for the first week.  I put it on at night and in the morning like the bottle says, but my eyes would itch and water all throughout the day.  I decided to just put it on at night and see how that went.  Same thing.  I then put it on at night and in the morning I washed it off but still no change in my eyes.  I then took a week off from the product seeing if there was a change the next week but to no avail.  Now, I did see an great improvement in the dark circles under my eyes in that week but I just couldn't take my eyes itching and watering all day long when I'm trying to work.  It must be an allergic reaction for me but maybe it will be a different experience for you!! Firstly, I have tried just about every eye cream for my dark circles but have not had these type of results! I am olive complected and and am of East Indian descent but I was born in the US. I barely started trying Biotique through Amazon and have been thrilled! I LOVE how this eye cream smells but more importantly, it really works! I literally put it on at nightly two days in a row and have noticed a big difference. If you are looking for a product that does what it claims, contains natural ingredients and is low priced, then I would strongly recommend you try this product. Also, the seller is very kind and responds to emails. I would purchase this product again from this seller in a heartbeat. I haven't been using this product very long yet but I just love how hydrating this cream is. I have been using it day and night and its  light and creamy and my eyes feel refreshed and hydrating after applying. The jar is bigger than I expected so that was a plus too! I haven't noticed a difference with the darkness yet but I understand it takes time and its not a miracle I have some other changes I need to do as well such as a better sleep schedule and better water drinking habits. Overall I am satisfied. So the first time I used it it was too much for my eyes. Now I try to use it without even getting close to my eyes, and it still burns within 3 minutes after applying the cream. It's annoying really, and I haven't seen a change in my dark circles. Wish I could return but have already used it. Unfortunately, I wouldnt buy again. If your looking for a cream that will make a difference dont purchase it. You can use it for normal moisturizing but nothing more than that. Remember to apply it way below your undereye or it will burn your eyes. This cream is hydrating! I love that it all natural. I am not sure if it helps with dark circles but definitely keeps the skin around my eyes well hydrated, so no fine lines. I could see the difference in the winter months as I had stopped using this cream for a month so this is a must for all those living in colder climates. This cream is amazing! I don't know what all the negative stuff is about.  It smells like heaven...that healthy ayurvedic clean very pleasant aroma. The cream has this delectable texture that melts into the skin around these eyes and there is a noticeable clean bright look after it dries. This company definitely makes one of the best...well no, theee best eye cream I have ever used. I love the way it goes on creamy then goes translucent then brightens and smooths and straightens the wrinkles and lifts the eyes in general and without irritation! I will definitely reorder. This is definitely a keeper!!"
565,B000E75ES2,"My household recently decided to switch our hand soap from Kiss My Face Lemon-Ginger to Mrs. Meyer's after reading some very positive reviews. We've been using this soap for about a week already like it better than we ever liked our previous soap.The fragrance of the Lemon Verbena is interesting. I would almost compare it to the smell of clean laundry (detergent plus fabric softener) more than lemon. Despite the lack of lemon fragrance I really like the smell. It just reminds me of clean. I would caution anyone with sensitive noses that the smell is definitely on the strong side.Our previous hand soap was decent but I consistently disliked the lack of a strong lather. That is not the case here. This soap lathers extremely well even with just a small amount. I never dispense a full pump of soap into my hands because it's simply not needed here.At. $.31/oz. this soap is also considerably less expensive than our previous hand soap, however, slightly more expensive than brands like Softsoap.Recommended. The hand soap itself is fine and I would have given it 4 stars if I had actually received a case initially.  However, instead of a case, I received one bottle.  Which entailed a hassle to actually get the other 5 bottles.  First Amazon customer service who agreed to send me a case at no charge and said that I could just keep the extra bottle.  Then an email from Amazon which said that I had to return the initial case or I would be charged an additional $21.99.  So I had the hassle of finding a box to ship back my one bottle,plus the time required to write a letter explaining why I wasn't returning a case, and then the trip to the UPS store to drop off the box.  From now on, I will buy my hand soap at the grocery store. I really like the smell and how well it works.  Ordering it from Amazon has the added convenience of getting a large quantity of liquid hand soap to use in all the bathrooms.  The soap is good quality and does not overly dry out our hands especially during the harsh winter months.  Mrs Meyer's brand has a reputation for natural products and, while some of their ingredients may be questionable (for example, sodium lauryl sulfate), I think it is a good product overall and a safe one for my family. The scent is marvelous!  Really refreshing.  They make it in the US - yay!  One minor point - I wish it were a little more liquid and a little less gel-like.  Sometimes a pump of soap will just slide off in a big lump when I'm trying to squish it onto my hands.  Adding water to the bottle solves the issue, but it would be nice if they fixed the consistency.  Still - I don't use anything else! :) You can get it cheaper in Target. I like the scent and the fact that it is NOT antibacterial (seems harder & harder to find these days). Though I have no way of knowing, I like the fact that it is natural and seems  to have a shorter list of scary ingredients. I does not lather much, which means you will go through it faster than average. I recommend this poduct. We were using the Basil scent which we really loved and I decided to try something new so we ordered the Lemon Verbena. The lemon scent is much more of a kitchen-type smell and seems to linger a bit more. Maybe it's more of a traditional soap smell but we don't love it like the Basil scent. I guess you just need to like a strong lemon smell though. The soap itself lathers up well and does a good job though. I like the soap, it's a good price for a quality product.  My only issue with it is the product itself.  Honestly I feel like it's to dry.  It's winter and it's already dry enough. It is otherwise a great product, and I don't know that it's especially dry, just comparatively to some of the creamier soaps. After ordering this, i learned that Target had (at the time) lower prices and a larger selection.That said, it's good stuff - and I'm picky about soap smells.Also, this same company makes Caldrea soap, which I like better (but it costs more)."
566,B001AWL010,"Let me start this review by saying I have tried many, many different brands of eye creme, and got so sick of wasting money on goop that didn't work, irritated my eyes, or made me break out, that I stopped using it all together. I've purchased drug store brands, natural brands, department store brands, Sephora brands...you name it. Made no difference. Enter Lumessence.I received a sample of this creme when I ordered some products directly from Aubrey Organics. Since it was already here, I figured I might as well try it. At least I hadn't wasted money on it, and I do like Aubrey products very much. The sample had enough for a few uses, so I got to apply it a few times. It provided wonderful moisture, didn't irritate my eyes at all, and caused no skin eruptions or allergy. So far so good, I thought, but will it do anything other than soften skin? I gave in and bought a bottle just to see.O.M.G. I'm literally amazed. I'm almost 43, and some fine lines were starting to show. I've been using this product since the end of December, and it has actually made these lines less noticeable. The skin under my eyes looks firmer and brighter as well. You only need a tiny amount to do the job (less than one pump for both eyes) so it's actually a fantastic value. Just make sure to shake the bottle very well before applying since there are no stabilizers or preservatives added. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine giving a positive review for eye creme, so give it a try. I hope you'll like it as much as I do. Doesn't irritate my skin or sting my eyes and keeps the eye area moisturized without being overly heavy or greasy. I like that the ingredients are not scary like some other brands I've used. Have bought several times and will keep on using.In terms of the ""rejuvenation"" aspect of the cream, I have to say that I don't see any visible changes other than it being moisturized (which is not a bad thing). I think dark circles and puffiness for me have more to do w/the amount of sleep I get and my diet more than some cream I'm patting on it a couple of times per day. Wrinkle situation is pretty much the same. But I was looking for a good natural eye cream and not miracles so I'm happy with this cream. This eye creme is a pleasant alternative to the many chemical options out there. We need more nature based products that work as good or better than those made with chemicals. I'm happy to have found this and tried it. I have been using it for about a month. It is light in consitency, more like a serum then a creme. A little goes a long ways. It is light enough to go under makeup in the morning, but it does take a few minutes to absorb. It leaves my undereye area moisturized, and has made a noticable difference in the dryness and fine wrinkles.On the negative side, the container itself seems a little weak. The clear palstic lid is cracked in many places, and I have never dropped it. Not that it affects the products effectiveness in any way, but I just thought I would mention this! This cream is great. I origanlly bought this to use for my slight under eye color which it fixed really fast. I never had really dark under eye problems but it was noticeable. I do have sensitive skin, especially my face. My face is pretty clear of blemishes but ocassionally i will have a some acne & it always leaves a dark spot. I use this cream to clear up spots & it works fast even if I miss a day or two. Insrct bites & other scars leave dark spots too so I use on my arms & legs too. It is even clearing up an old burn scar on my arm. I LOVE THIS CREAM! Whole Foods stopped carrying this awesome product for some other really bad stuff. This is by far the best eye cream I have ever used. I am 61 and I look 40 because of the protection this cream provides. I have used it for ten years now. When whole foods stopped carrying it, I tried a couiple other creams and none compare. I started to get bags and dark circles under my eyes. So I decided to order it on line. I love it. As I reach the last third of this product in the bottle I have noticed the odor is quite unpleasant and am very hesitant to use it at all. I was not that impressed with this product, anyway. It's strange because I had a sample which I loved but the product I ordered seemed quite different from the sample. I did not feel that hydrated or as smooth as other products. I have started using argan oil instead and find that I much prefer it to this product. I like this product. It absorbs nicely and doesn't irritate my eyes. Just can't tell if it's working. I love Aubrey Organic products!!!  I specially like the aloe kind for sensitive skin.  The eye cream though isn't my favorite.  It is a little too watery for me but I still buy it since it is good!  If you have super sensitive skin like me try this!  It is very mild without offensive scent."
567,B000Z4NDLO,"I have loved this product for years. I have trouble finding it some times. Will keep using this for as long as I can find it. Smooth light weight coverage with SPF  tinted to go with most skin tones. I wear with moisturizer and I'm good to go. I have used this product for years as I have rosacea and have to be careful what I use on my face.  This is a great product and works very well.  They apparently have discontinued the spf40 replaced by spf50 which is very think and hard to use.  I will have to be happy with the spf25 but am sorry to see the spf40 be gone.  I hope Amazon has substantial supplies. I love this facial sun protection.  I've used it for years.  It's perfect! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! Have been using it forever and LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Was very unhappy when I couldn't get it at Macy's anymore.  Happy to purchase on Amazon. GREAT PRODUCT!! Holy moly do I love this product!  I run pink/red (not rosacea, just fair and sensitive) and going out in the sun just makes everything worse.  I tried this and it has made a HUGE difference in my skin.  There's a very slight tint to it that greatly reduces my skin's redness and provides a more even overall appearance.  I apply it with a foundation brush, after moisturizing and before foundation, though on many days, Super City Block is enough and I don't even need foundation.  People always used to ask me if I had a sunburn before I found Super City Block and I would have to say, ""No, just bad skin,"" but I haven't had to say it once since I found this.  The spf is light and doesn't have a funky smell or feel sticky.  I honestly couldn't recommend this more to anyone looking to protect her skin and reduce overall redness. Best SPF I could find and I've tried many, including very expensive face sunscreens. Each one I tried was either too greasy or fell off, or was giving me additional whiteness; since the creams were bright white. I felt I was vampire looking especially on vacation.So I started looking for one that gives some more natural skin shade. I tried the BB and CC creams and well they were just over advertised foundation that clogged pores.Great news everyone!!! No need to look any more : This cream is a complete miracle. Protects your skin from the sun, is not greasy at all, gives you this nice even complexion glow and no foundation needed! Absolutely 0 remarks and please do never ever change the formula! I am continuously STUNNED with the excellent results and went out of my way to say how impressed I was. Applies easily, works great!"
568,B0013I57BA,"This feels like a mud mask! So thick and lathers good. Gently exfoliates my face feels so clean. Love it I have sensitive skin and can get oily if the exfoliant is very strong but this is so soft and silky that I can use it every day if I so choose. The scrub has smaller pieces so it gets at the gross crud on your skin without damaging or feeling those painful scratches of some scrubs. After trying many facial exfoliants, this one was a pleasant surprise! Usually I have sensitive skin to scrubs like this, but my skin feels amazing after use. I found this in a local, natural food store and have been using it for 10 years. I’ll never change exfoliants! I have used this scrub for years. I like the finer  texture. It doesn’t feel like I am rubbing gravel on my face 😜 Face feels 😊! And there is no residue on your skin which is a plus. No over the top fake fragrance either. For me, it’s a win win! 💖 Been using this product for many years. Works great for me!! Have been using Dessert essence for years The product is gentle  yet does the job . this product is very thick and very hard to move around even on a wet face and the scrubbing bubbles are very rough. it left me with little red blotches where it looked like my face was scratched ! and this item is NOT RETURNABLE! My skin is very difficult at least on my face it is.  I've tried everything from medication to proative and other on the shelf minerals. I had some spare time at work one day and googled herbs to help improve severe acne.  I found tea tree oil, then I found dessert essence! Tee tree oil has done a wonderful job in clearing up my skin.  I really don't get black heads anymore except sometimes under the chin area.  But my face recently started to appear it was getting scorched by everything. Always red and agitation by anything little as some sun light. It's also very dry and flaky. The tea tree oil seems to be clearing up that part.  It seems to be taking away all the redness :) Now this is were the scrub product comes in! It's helping it to be smoother. I love how it feels. Leaves a nice clean soft feeling. I was reading that it works well for oily skin, but it also works well for beyond unrepairable skin that's super dry and has years of scar acne.  Thank you dessert essence for helping my skin to get back to me! As a 32 yr old having skin issue, it's very annoying!"
569,B000GX77NO,"Came faster than expected and perfect Love the product, love Mary Kay will buy again. Very prompt shipping, The products were well packed, with care and a lot of attention. I liked it a lot, Congratulations on the beautiful work. I love Mary kay. It cleans my face very well. Very seldom have a breakout. I am very particular about my face products. I had gone on vacation and realized I left my face wash at home. I used this product (It was all my mom had at the house) and was AMAZED!!! Instant love. I ended up taking the product home with me. Eventually it ran out and I noticed my skin getting dull again. Black heads and hormonal acne (I am 36 yrs old) started moving in. I ordered This kit on Friday and had a Saturday delivery. As son as it arrived Saturday I used it - and INSTANTLY my face looked better. It is now Tuesday and my skin is beautiful. I am at a point in my cycle where my skin should be an absolute mess, but it's not. It's perfect.I am in LOVE with this product.I originally only used step 1 because that was all my mother had on hand at the house. I am now using step 1 & 2 (2 is the replenish - after wash). I can't really say how much step 2 is doing for me. I am still using my own moisturizer because I do feel a tad bit dry with just the replenish, but it doesn't matter. Step 1 is incredible, even alone. I am hoping the step 2 will do more in terms of fine lines.Yes - I fully recommend this product.I have a very oily T-zone and very dry elsewhere on my face. Since this works great on my combinantion skin - I imagine it can be used on Dry or Oily skin This is one of the best products I have ever used for my skin. Mary Kay is a great brand that does wonders for my skin. I like how firm it feels after using this product, and clean. My face looks cleaner and people have also used the term 'brighter' after I use this. Refine, step 1: It has scrubbing beads (so only scrub hard like me if you really want to clean, plus those beads feel good :)  --but scrubbing hard is not necessary). This exfoliates and cleanses pores deeply, shrinking pores (if you have an issue with that), and removing dead skin and black/whiteheads etc. (if you have those things), or makes them easy to remove afterwards (if it did not remove during the wash, which it usually does).  Replenish, step 2: This is a very soothing crème, feels nice and smooth when putting on (a thin layer is all that's needed). What's also cool about this is that if it's hot, you don't really sweat, you have more of a dewy feel, and it keeps you cool. Just 1 or 2 times a week is all you need to use this product (more than that is just too often). This will all depend on the condition of your skin. This is also beneficial to preventing (early signs of) aging with skin, and starting to use this in your 20s like I have is a smart move. I highly recommend this product to ages ~25+, and, for your regular skin cleansing days, use the Mary Kay Timewise 3 in 1 cleanser. It's a lot gentler for such regular use, but still very effective. Works quickly It has being Three Months since i've been used the Microdermabrasion set, i have not seen big change. However, it's good for dry Skin. It fade little bit my scares acne, but this is not the way i was told it worked. I was expecting from this product openes the pores, but it does not go into the skin. it does not go deep. So far i'm in my second set, but my deep scar acne still on my face. The product so small I do not know how many I will need to get way of my scar acne. Besides, my acnes still pop up. However, do not give-up because it is very good for dry/sensitive skin. No matter how dry and sensitive your skin is, it helps. This product need a good bleaching bar soap along with it to help get way of the scar acne faster. As i said, do not give it up because it is a good help for people who have very sensitive and Dry skin like me, this is keep me still using it. For the dry and sensitive skin, you'll see the change right away, but for the acne scars, you won't see in two weeks as the producers said. I'm going to my third set twice a day, my light acne scars are starting to fade up. I meant for the deep scars, i have not seen big change. It workd very slow on that."
570,B001ECQ55M,"I see a lot of reviews displeased with this body lotion for it's potent scent, but I feel the complete opposite. I've ceased using cologne because I'm so pleased with how it smells. Lotion up after a shower and not only do I feel fantastic, but I smell fantastic.Only asked a few women so far what they thought of the scent, but they all responded positively. Yes, it's somewhat strong as far as body lotions go, but no more so than any other product intended to provide a scent like a cologne. It's a very masculine smell, but not aggressively so. It's just pleasant.If you want an unscented body lotion, steer clear of this product. However, if you'd like to try a lotion with a scent, I think most people would be very pleased with it. Not only does it work quite well (in regards to the effectiveness of the lotion itself), but it smells quite great.Will definitely be buying again in the future. Highly recommended. i like this product. been using for a long time. i just received it with a broken pump. can't use it. Took a gamble that this was going to be good and smell nice.  always a risk when ordering on-line.  These guys did their homework.  I'll buy again for sure. Makes my skin feel better instantly! Love the smell, though when my skin is extra sensitive sometimes, I’ll switch because it can be too much El nivel de absorción es lo mejor. Se siente muy bien. En la piel. La recomiendo. I ordered this lotion for my son because he had dry skin. His skin looks great since he used this lotion regularly. I will buy this lotion again when needed. It smells manly and I am no longer cracking on my hands. Plus my girlfriend loves the smell of it. This thing is insane how good it is.  I’m a man and hate creams I hate the greasy feeling it leaves behind but as of late I need one because the 13 years of working under the sun has caught up to me on my legs since I always wear shorts. This thing moisturizes great and the greasiness disappears in less than a minute."
571,B001E765KC,"I love how refreshed I feel after spraying the rosewater. It's not to strong of a scent and definitely gets used everyday by me. Thank you so much! plus its alot more affordable then the amount I had to spend at the store for just one. This use to be a Trader Joe’s product that I fell in love with. It seems the formula has changed. However, it is still very hydrating but a lot more expensive. I've been buying this for several years now, and I love it. Moisturizers are great for holding moisture in your skin, and a few spritzes of this gives my moisturizer something to hold. It also makes my moisturizer last longer because the moisture on your skin allows you to use less moisturizer and still easily cover your whole face.The sprayer provides a fine mist instead of big droplets, so your face doesn't feel dripping wet when you're done. The sprayer is so great in fact that I keep my old bottles and fill them with regular water for misting my hair during styling. (Especially great when I had really short hair and would wake up looking like a rooster.)I also keep a bottle at work. When you're tired or your skin feels dry, spraying a fine mist wakes you up without destroying your makeup. I am currently pregnant and looking for refreshment in this hot weather. I've been using this spray for multiple reasons over the last month or so and I just love it. At night time I spray my face before putting on night cream; at work when I feel my skin is dry I spritz my face and it feels lovely; I use it to spray my hair in between washes to refresh it. The smell is amazing, I love roses and this has a potent but not overpowering smell.I plan on using this on my baby when she comes to refresh her during the summer. I have extremely sensitive skin and this has not caused any reaction at all so I think it will be good for the baby too. I have a lot of sensitivities and this does not bother me at all. I love it and use the spray regularly. It has a fresh, light, smell. It adds much needed moisture to my skin. I'm very happy with this product! It a worth the money. My face does feel refreshed and I notice it does have the reddness go away!  I only used it twice but I'm already impressed. I believe it is like the younquie make up rose water. But you get more for what you pay for this way. Only bad thing is it does feel Sticky after you spray it on but the sticky feeling goes away after maybe 10 minutes when it Drys. But overall I am happy with it! My daughter and I love this product. It feels so crisp when it mists your face and neck. We use after a shower then apply moisturizer after it dries. It's wonderful in the hot AZ summer as a mid day refresher! I've been using this spray for a few years now and love to freshen my face with it or to moisten/re-wet my hair to style. I got a package of 3 and one of the bottles leaked all over the box and made everything else sticky but product is still worth a 5 star! So, I am missing a little bit but hopefully they can tighten the caps better. Love this product though!"
572,B000MASTNI,"I was looking for a natural chemical exfoliant, and the EWG website led me to this. Its a bit pricey for the amount of product that you get, but I only use about a dime sized amount once a week, so it lasts a while, and it’s a good product. This has made my skin smooth without the irritation that I used to get from using rough scrubs, and it really helps to get rid of blackheads, although I do have a few stubborn ones that tend to stick around. Its not perfect, but it works better than anything else I’ve used. I would just make a few suggestions for anyone wanting to try this product:1- Don’t use it everyday. The manufacturer claims that you can, and some people may be able to tolerate it, but I found it to be too drying when used daily, and you’re really only supposed to exfoliate one or twice a week2- Let the enzymes do most of the work. They really help to loosen up the dead skin, so physical scrubbing should be gentle and minimal. I let it sit on my skin for two minutes and don’t actually start scrubbing until the last minute just before I rinse it off3- Don’t forget to moisturize after use. While this product is gentle compared to most of your average drugstore products, it is still a little drying. Use a little HA serum and a good moisturizer after, and your skin will thank you. def recommend this enzyme scrub.i am new to the mychelle line and have tried 7 different products over the past 7 months (including the f.e.cleanser, mist, two eye creams, lotion, & serum) and this one is my favorite so thought i'd take the time to write a review.i'm a mom of two toddlers with sensitive, caucasian skin - with the stress, who-knows-what-on-my-face from the kids, hormonal breakouts in my 30s, i needed something gentle while efficient in cleaning, smoothing, and just giving me an overall rejuvenated effect. this one has fit the bill for me.i use less than a dime size amount about every other night with slightly wet hands, massage onto my face, leave on for just a couple minutes, & rinse - which is about all the time i have to donate to my face lol and so far, this has worked like a charm leaving me refreshed. i still have about half a bottle left, too, after 7 months of use; a little goes a long way.i'm not a fan of the line's mist (can't help but feel like i'm spraying Sprite on my face lol), could give or take the cleanser because i feel it doesn't seem to work as well as the scrub yet intended to do essentially the same thing (i usually will be a bit more oily after the cleanser), same goes for the lotion, but it is gentle and light - there are prob better products out there lotion-wise, i do enjoy the serum at night, and the eye creams (have both the dry & normal one) - don't notice a diff between the two.long story not-so-short, the fruit enzyme scrub is definitely worth a try. I use this scrub about 3 time a week. It's very gentle yet effective.  It smoothes away dry skin patches and evens out my skin tone, leaving my skin so soft! I’ve used this for years. Love it.  It does have a strong smell but it is a plant fragrance not one made from petrochemicals.  Very few products I can use on my face because of extreme sensitivity but this is great. I'm 64 and back out in the dating world. I love this scrub because it keeps my skin fresh and glowing. The small particles that do the hard work are very fine and do not irritate the skin on my face. LOVE it! I have been ""blessed"" with the typical combination skin, oily in places, taut in others, and with some occasional breakouts and fine lines to boot. A friend turned me on to this product after giving me some samples. I use this over my entire face after washing with regular cleanser. It has a grainy yet gentle, creamy texture, and smells fresh and citrus-y. After massaging a dime-sized amount in circles for a couple of minutes, I can feel that warmth that tells me the enzymes and fruit acids are doing their thing. The result? I seriously have gone without any foundation lately (just some tinted moisturizer), my skin looks that good. I find the more I use it, the better it works. After building up some tolerance to the fruit acids, I can now use it every other day. What used to be a bumpy, congested, tired-looking complexion is now glow-y, smooth, and fresh. I would estimate it took about 5 years off (and counting) my appearance. If this came in giant tubs I would buy them all! I have been using MyChelle products for a couple years now and this Fruit Enzyme Scrub is one of my favorites. Works really well for my wife & I. We both have pretty sensitive skin and the MyChelle products seems to be working. No extra break outside leaves skin soft and looking great. One of my wife's coworkers when we started using this asked a few months in what she was doing cause her skin looks great. I recommendation I would have is to follow up with a moisturizer after using the Fruit Enzyme Scrub. I like this wash but I don’t love it. It works well and leaves my skin feeling great bits just not as good as the sugar scrub that I like better (same company). It has a fine grit to it and leaving it on works well. It’s good but I like others better."
573,B001ET78RE,"I’m mid-50s and late to skincare.  A friend gave this to me years ago because it was too intense for her.  Vitamin C is a gift to my pale, 50+, post-meno skin.  I use this moisturizer everywhere - on my knees, elbows, face, etc.One caution, it typically stimulates blood flow on me so I use this at night or an hour before I’ll see other people.  Basically it gives me a flush but it does look spotty for about 30 minutes.  It’s never bothered me, I don’t feel it but my wife sometimes comments because she worries what other people think. Been using this product for years, along with the lavender night cream and the cleansing gel rinse, all from the Vitamin C line.  I won't use any product that is not cruelty free. I have extremely sensitive skin and would have tremendous reactions to other creams in years past.  Once I switched to cruelty free and to Avalon's Vitamin C, no reactions at all, which was great.  I don't wear any makeup, ever, not even a lick of foundation, a decision I made several decades ago when I was 17 and was horrified leaving the house without my black eyeliner!  Figured I didn't want to get into my 40s and be frightened to step outside without makeup, so decided there and then to not wear it anymore.  And yes, am n my 40s and perfectly fine leaving the house without anything on my face, other than my Avalon cream.  I like to keep my skin clear and looking fresh, this enables me to do that and no animals were hurt in the process.  Sometimes I notice a slight difference in texture with each order, but it doesn't seem to make any difference to how it feels and works.  Hope they continue to make this product, as I don't know what I would do without it. Used with the face wash the coverage is seamless. It comes in a pair of jars which is convenient as one is only open for a short time and it totals a normal month supply. The fragrance is light and pleasant, dissipates quickly after putting it on. The texture is super creamy, very nice, smooth to apply. Note: The first time I ordered it the price was just over $6 which was reasonable. This second order the price has more than doubled and I am reconsidering the future with it.I have looked around the web to find this is a good price, more than that, the first order gave the 'by-the-jar' price which made the price the same the second time, just totaled for 2, not each. I use this all the time. It has a great refreshing feel and scent. It's just the right amount of moisture. It's my favorite moisturizer. The problem I had is that I ordered it through Subscribe & Save and received 2 containers. I just opened the second container two months later and it's all dried out. I've never opened a container where it wasn't light and creamy. I hope this isn't a ""knock off"" or I perhaps shouldn't have ordered 2 containers at a time through Subscribe & Save. My husband and I have been using this cream as a moisturizer for 2 years now and we plan to keep on using it for as long as they keep it in stock. It's definitely made our skin feel ""renewed"" and my husband loves how it has lightened his skin tone significantly. I have naturally light skin so there were no skin tone changes for me but it does noticeably brighten my skin as well. It also keeps the wrinkles at bay and does not cause breakouts even though I have sensitive skin. I also have dry skin and this cream is great for that as well.So basically, this cream delivers on all that it promises and more. Plus, it contains organic ingredients, doesn't contain toxic chemicals, and involves no animal testing whatsoever. It's an all around awesome product that is so worth the money. I bought this when I was pregnant and didn’t want any funky chemicals absorbing through my skin. It’s been so great I bought another 2-pack even though I’m not pregnant anymore (it’s good to keep chemicals out when nursing too!). My skin really likes this cream! Also their face/body scrub! When I got close to 30, my skin started changing and I was dealing with cystic acne for the first time ever.  I was using this cream at the time, and by playing around with other elements of my skincare routine, I managed to keep it in check.  Then my jar ran out, so I decided to try a new product (Yes To Blueberries moisturizer).  I almost immediately started breaking out when I switched!  I hadn't really considered that the mositurizer would make a difference, I thought the other changes I had made were keeping me from breaking out.I also agree with another reviewer that even though it's a thicker cream, it feels light and not greasy.  I apply it as soon as I get out of the shower, wait ten minutes for it to absorb, and then put on my makeup.  Also this two pack is a pretty good deal, if I buy this cream from the grocery store or Target, it's about $20 a jar after tax.  Currently the price is $30 for two jars, it used to be a little lower, but it's still a good deal. Good Absorption: Decent PriceThis is pretty clean product when it comes to not containing the multitude ofdrying and extender ingredients in many moisturizers.Its a bit thick hence we combine it with another product. One that will allow you to useless of the moisturizer which means longer shelf live as well.The ""other ingredient"" is  Cosmedica Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Just wash your face with a clean product,pat it dry, add a few squirts of Serum and then apply the moisturizer over the serum. Not sure this will take away winkles yetyour face, neck and arms sure will like it."
574,B000O5MCPW,"I don't see any difference on my skin after two weeks of using it twice a day, but I will continue using it until the two bottles I bought are done. I'll update this review if anything changes. I noticed my neck was looking like ""turkey neck"" this totally toned it up again!! Been using every night for a few years and it's STILL TONING MY NECK!! IM now 58 and refuse to look like I'm old....THIS WORKS,AND ITS A MUST BUY!! First time I bought this cream was years ago.  A cellulite problem is a common problem that women have so I didn't really hope for much but just thought to give it a try. I was in my early 20s and had a lot of marks on my knee area (the back side). What the cream did just astonished me. It took care of those marks completely while I was using it leaving me speechless. Didn't do much to the cellulite though. Once I stopped using the cream - marks came right back to me. Years later I have decided to give it another try for the same results. Let's see if it helps, now that I'm 30. I've been using this product for some time and love it - So much so that I signed up for subscribe and save. In my August 2020 shipment it was listed and billed as a 2 pack but I only received one tube and haven't been able to find a way to report that other than returning the one tube I did receive... which I needed to keep up the regimen of twice daily. I've lost a lot of weight and this has helped tremendously with firming the loose skin. Disappointed in this seller and planning to cancel this subscription, I'll just order higher quantity of the single tubes.To update: I was able to chat online with representative  who arranged for another shipment, again listed on my Amazon orders as a 2 pk and again I only received one tube. I want to love this for the better price I get buying a 2 pk, but in reality I suspect I'll have to contact Amazon every month to actually receive the advertised 2. I used this product last year and it had better results that this year...funny because last year I was heavier and had worse cellulite then! The product did change its formula though so maybe thats why?I used this for 2 weeks twice a day for 20 minutes, massaging it very hard into my skin until I developed bruises. There was little effect on my cellulite however it did make my skin look much firmer and made my stretch marks almost disappear. I love the supple, firm feeling it gives me, I just wish it got rid of cellulite like it claims.Well! It can! I then bought the Finulite Cellulite Smoothing Massage Mitt. What I did was rub the Nivea lotion over the areas until the skin was pretty wet. I took the mitt and massaged in into my skin for 10 minutes twice a day very roughly so bruises came. Within two days my minor cellulite was gone, within a week, the average looking cellulite was almost gone. I stopped using it for a few days, some of the cellulite has come back but not nearly as bad as before. I'm going to use it again to make it all go away. The mitt is so much better of an investment, its cheaper and it makes it so you don't go through as many nivea tubes. Your not supposed to use the mitt on dry skin, hence the reason I continue to use nivea. Actually I couldn't believe this product! It says that it will reduce thhe cellulite in 4 weeks and I've been using it for 2 weeks and it actually does what it say!!! I want to tell all women that I had serious cellulite problems that I thought no product can make it go away but this product really reduced the cellulite until now by nearly 70% and I haven't finished my 4 weeks yet!!!At first I couldn't believe that no product can reduce the appearance of cellulite but I was so desperate and tried everything but nothing worked. Except this one!!! And when you use it with the Nivea Serum Q10 it gives amazing results!! And the 2 packs will actually be enough for u for 4 weeks...I'm so happy I never had such toned legs since 5 years! I have been working out for 6 months and the cellulite wasn't going away. But if you work out, drink so much water (10 glasses a day) and use this product you will be amazed!! And believe me I have tried this without using this product and it didn't work before!Enjoy your new thighs ;) ;) :D Having gained a bit of extra weight over the past few months, I knew that something needed to be done before I visited Florida this summer. My legs showed a lot of cellulite that I wanted to get rid of. I did not have time to lose the extra weight before playing in the waves and lounging on the beach. I decided to see if this gel could help me. I have to say that it does work. You do need to use it every day or the results will go away. The skin on my legs looked and felt firm and smooth on the beach and in a bathing suit. I could not see the evidence of cellulite that had been so prevalent before using the gel. This truly made a huge difference. Even my teenaged daughter noticed and told me that my legs looked a whole lot better. Neither of us could believe the difference! Just remember to start using this product a minimum of two days before you want to see results. The longer you use it, the better. (I also decided to use this on my upper arms.) Pretty impressed. Been using for about a month. I apply it liberally after a bath or shower to my upper thigh (front and back) and there is a noticeable difference in the texture and appearance. I seriously would recommend this product if you have been struggling with other products and their lack of results. Don't be impatient with this product give yourself about 3 weeks to see some impact.  I will continue using and I am sure it can only continue to get better."
575,B0009VNI2C,"Why would we want that strong of a flowery or whatever it is smell, directly on our sensitive faces sensitive eyes & nose?.. that's just it, I don't., so not for me, way too scented for a face cream! Nice scent! I love this product and bought it so many times, it leaves your skin very soft without getting oily, observes really well . First, I have an oily skin, sensitive and acne prone. So, I’m very picky in choosing the right product. This vitamin E cream can work as a moisturizer. I apply it at night alone, last step of my skincare routine. As when I apply it in the morning, my face gets oilier towards the end of the day, given the hot weather where I live and my oily T-zone. It works well at night. I love the texture, enough to get absorbed fast and to moisturize. When I wake up in the morning, I’d see how hydrated my face is. Considering the healing properties of aloe vera, it’s been helping lightening my acne scars and minimizing the appearance of fine lines. So happy with this cream! Not to mention, its affordability and really a great size. Lastly, goes a long way. This tub could last you roughly 2-3 months. I have had dry skin my whole life.  It gets especially bad in the winter with my fingers cracking. For about a year, I had cracked fingers with scaly dry patches on several fingers that didn't even go away in the warmer weather.  I tried every product I could find that boasted help for ""severe dry skin"" and nothing worked.  I went to my regular doctor and a dermatologist and tried a couple different prescription creams/ointments which still did nothing for my poor hands.  I was truly getting desperate when I stumbled across the Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Skin Care Cream.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It is so soothing to the skin and for the first time ever, I went all winter without a single crack on my fingers!  It took a few weeks of consistent use, but it even got rid of the scaly dry patches and they have not returned.  I coat my hands before I go to sleep at night and I have a jar on my desk that I use if my hands feel dry during the day.  (I also use it on my elbows and heels and it has made a huge difference with them as well.)  It is not greasy or sticky and it has a pleasant scent.  To top it off, it is made in the USA with no animal testing.  They have a version that comes in a tube, too, but I prefer the little jars.  I've given some jars to friends and everyone loves it. I would buy this again. I love this product. It smells so good. The price was good too. It penetrates quickly into my dry skin. When these are empty I will be getting more for sure. I'm giving this product 5 stars as it's everything I was looking for in a cream for me and my son. Cold/cool weather can be rough on skin so I needed something to alleviate the dryness and smooth out the rough patches on my hands and this aloe vera cream delivered.I tried it as soon as it came and later went to church where I shook hands with some people. One girl exclaimed:""Your hands are so soft!"" It surprised me and then I remembered oh yeah I used this lotion on my hands a few hours ago! So the nourishing effect doesn't disappear as with some creams, but lasts.The extra bonus is a nice herbal, refreshing scent. It lingers but it doesn't stand out too much and it's not very perfumery.The texture is light and silky like it's a rich balm and not oily or greasy in any way. I was really pleased with that.It doesn't have a pump but I actually prefer that with creams and lotions as the pumps can get clogged sometimes.I didn't try it on my face but I can see myself use it all over my face under makeup as my skin does not easily develop allergies. Again it helps that the cream doesn't form a greasy film, so it should offer a good base for foundation.I'm very pleased. Now I want my mom to try the second jar!"
576,B000K7J39M,"As one of those people who found themselves unlucky enough to not grow out of my acne I have found this clay mask to really help keep everything in check without having to resort to really harsh chemicals or anything else that would just dry my skin out. It also washes clean super easy which makes it great for those of us with facial hair. This is an ideal mask for my oily skin. I have deep pores and using good skin products (incl good clay mask) is critical for me.  I usually apply it in the morning so my skin won't be so oily and shiny during the day. I immediately can feel and see the difference - my skin feels cleaner and (I know it's hard to imagine) but I can see that it does bring out the dirt or whatever is there in my pores.  It can't replace a good facial, of course, but if you apply it few times a week - it makes the difference for my skin. It cleans my pores (not a lot but still counts) and improves my face color. What else I can ask for?Another advantage of this mask - I have kind of sensitive skin (my blood vessels are close to the surface) so some other masks with menthol or mint make my skin burn.  Not this one.  And you have to apply it for 10 min only.  I have been using it for few years along with different masks of course and still like it.  The best clay mask I have ever had. After hitting forty, hormones or the environment--something changed and I began having acne issues, especially blackheads around the oily areas of my face. Proactiv helped with acne, but didn't reduce the enlarged pores or stop blackheads from forming.Long ago, I used a clay mask by Artistry. The mask would visibly draw oil from pores. That's sort of what I was hoping to happen here, but this was more of a sensory experience. The tea tree oil causes you to feel more than see what was happening.After about three uses, my pores reduced as well as my blackhead issue. The product is almost gone and though I like the progress, I was hoping more than a fifty percent improvement.LATHER White Clay Deep Pore Cleansing Mask has been the first clay white clay mask I've used since the Artistry days. I'd like to try a couple of different brands before deciding which I like best. As soon as I do, I'll update this review. This review is almost 2 years after purchase and I absolutely love this mask.  Truth be known - I was recommended this sort of mask (white clay) at a really high end spa which was priced close to triple the price.  Instead of falling for the pressure to buy at the spa, I thought of doing my due diligence and finding something similar elsewhere.  This product was it.  After putting it on my face and neck, I felt the mask working right away.  I had the same feeling at the spa - the esthetician said the mask would feel tingling which meant it was working by clearing my pores.  After about 10 minutes, I wipe with a warm face cloth and voila! Clean, fresh, healthy skin arises.  I do this about once or twice a week.  This product is a keeper :-) My face is much softer and smoother after using this mask just once. My only complaint is that I have combination oily/dry skin and if I wash my face before putting the mask on (as the directions indicate) it will burn, the tea-tree oil will sting. Instead I use it once a week, at the end of the day in place of a facial cleanser.I remember when Swiss Yves had a big blue tub of mineral mud that cost maybe $4.99 at any drugstore. Those days are over. It's so hard to find a great clay mask these days. Most are the clear, cucumber, peel-away masks that get stuck to your eyebrows and hair line. Nothing can clean out your pores and exfoliate the way a clay mask does. If you can't get a facial, this Lather stuff is the next best thing. I just received 2 Jars, thank you all for your reviews.I tryed this yesterday and I truly could feelthis working within just a few minutes.After 10 minutes I washed it off and my facefelt really nice and clean.So far so good. I love not having to pull offa nasty mask.I will be back & leave a better review after a month of usingthis product.Have a blessed day.9-28-2012 I have tried this for a while now, it makes your face tingle a bitand feels nice & clean, however I have not noticed any differancewith my pores. My pores are not very big at all I just thought maybe this might helpbut it did not, not for me anyway. This is the third time I purchase this mask. My skin is more combination with a tendency towards oily, but I don't have major breakouts. I love that when I do, I can blot this on the spot and it leave it on overnight - it is usually gone in the morning. This formula is super healing to my skin and I use it at least once a week overnight to keep my pores clear.As with anything, you need a proper skin care regimen, good dietary habits (including drinking water) or pretty much nothing works. This will not work miracles! I really wanted a kaolin clay masque and this one had good reviews. However, I was not impressed with it. For one, the tea tree oil in it burns my skin. It feels very unpleasant to have on and I can barely sit with it until it dries without tearing up from the burning sensation. When I take the masque off my face feels rough and bumpy and not actually all that clean. The last kaolin masque I used, which was just kaolin clay and water, made my skin really soft and smooth. This did not. It didn't break me out, but it didn't help existing breakouts or improve the quality of my skin. The cleaner your pores are, the smaller they look (to a limit). This didn't make any visible difference in them. I will use it up because it does make my face somewhat cleaner, but I won't be repurchasing."
577,B000PHP86E,"I've been using this product since last spring, and I wanted to wait a while before writing a review to see how it worked out for me beyond an initial ""honeymoon"" period.  I've decided it's time to finally write a review, and I must say, and this is not an exaggeration, that this product has changed my life.  I'm a man in my 30s who has suffered from acne since I was about 16.  The acne that I've had since I was about 25 until recently was a deep, cystic variety that occurred mostly around my jaw line.  Even when washing my face three times per day with expensive product, I would get one or two of these very large cystic zits per week.  The zits were so large and deep that they made my face swollen where they were, and they were very painful, but too deep under the surface of my skin for me to successfully pop.  When I went to the dermatologist with one of these deep cystic zits, she just lanced it, drained it, and injected it up with a steroid shot (not the most practical or helpful method of treatment since I was getting them so frequently).Long story short, I spent literally enough money to buy a car over the years on products, dermatologists, and prescriptions.  I went through two cycles of accutane, tried four sessions of laser hair removal on my entire beard area, had four laser acne treatments as well, and spent tons of money and time going to the dermatologist and picking up prescriptions for my skin. Among the products that I tried and never had any true, long term success with were differin, epiduo, tazorac, benzefoam, aczone, and countless others.  Nothing really worked.  I'd gone to three different dermatologists over the years, and for some reason, none of them had recommended any form of retinol. My girlfriend recommended that I try a retinol product, and she recommended this one to me since she'd heard that it was pretty effective.  I bought a bottle and started using it, and much to my delight, my cystic acne completely went away.  I'm glad to say that I have not had any large cystic zits around my jaw line since I've started rubbing a corn kernel sized dab of green cream onto my jaw line every night before going to bed.  I still continue to wash my face there times per day (with Proactiv renewing cleanser which seems to work well for me) since I'm sure I'd get some surface level blemishes if I didn't, but the green cream has effectively eliminated the major cystic zit problem I was having.  I started out using the level 9 of the product and never had any problems (probably because I have pretty tough skin), but my girlfriend's skin is too sensitive for the level 9, so if your skin is sensitive, you might want to start with the level 3 or 6.I think this product has one benefit that really gives it an edge over the competition with other retinol products: the bottle is specifically made to be air tight, so the retinol on the inside is never exposed to any air, which has a tendency to make it less potent (read up on retinol on wikipedia it for more details about potency and exposure to air). Overall, this product has made my life better by relieving me of the burden I had with my cystic acne.  If you're in a similar situation with acne problems of your own, I highly recommend you try out a bottle of green cream and see if it changes your life too. *****9 MONTH UPDATE*****I am just about to purchase my 3rd bottle of Green Cream. This cream has been the best product I have ever used on my face. It looks dewy, fresh and glows. The surface is softer to touch and brighter overall. The 2 bottles have lasted me 9 months!!!!!! You don't need much to make a difference. It's that good!!!!!*****Original Review*****I have had 2 fairly large horizontal neck rings for most of my life. I never really thought about until the last few years where they started to look darker, larger and unhappy. Along with this, the skin on my face didn't feel good anymore. It was very dull and rough in texture. As a result, I began a new project on how to make some improvement and slowdown what is happening to my skin.After comparing several products, I took the plunge on AST Green Cream 9. I did experience a 3 week period where my skin went through almost a ""peel"" from the product, but now I can honestly say, my face feels INCREDIBLE and remarkably improved. I wish I had started with this 5 years ago.1) Remove makeup2) Use hands to wash face and neck with a cleanser3) Use tonerAllow to dry completely. I try to wait at least 10 minutes here before doing the Green Cream.4) GREEN CREAM NO. 9. EVERY OTHER NIGHT.Squeeze out a pea size. I make teeny-tiny dots of the product on my forehead first and then rub in. Moving to the cheeks, nose, chin and finally neck (especially the rings!!!) as I rotate around my face and rub in. I do not put this on my eyelid area but do apply on the under eye area above my cheekbones. If I have ANY left over, I rub this into the back of my hands.****ALTERNATE NIGHTS*****:M2 High Potency Skin Refresh 20%.I apply this in a similar manner to the Green Cream except that it is more fluid and seems to spread easier. This works to resurface the skin, but it is a different type of Alpha Hydroxy acid which activates and exfoliates the uppermost layers of skin cells, while the Retinol in the Green Cream is absorbed to do it's work from the bottom up to encourage new skin cell growth.5) On nights that my skin feels especially dry, 30 minutes after Retinol or AHA application, I spread on a very light layer of German Nivea. Only the German Nivea tin which is closest to begin La Mer, without the price tag. I also sometimes use the Waxelene or even Coconut oil, depending upon my mood. Lately, my skin has felt so well, I have gone to bed without a layer of moisturizer.Now, after a couple months, the skin on my face is glowing and feels SO INCREDIBLY soft. It feels like my much younger face and I my neck rings have lightened. I plan to update this at the 6 month mark, but so far out of all of it, the Green Cream made the most drastic difference to my skin appearance and texture overall. I highly recommend it as a OTC retinol product without a prescription. Just be smart with it for certain, since your using this at home without a doctor's supervision. This is seriously a miracle cream. I've been using this cream for almost two years now. I use it after i wash my face with a glycolic acid cleanser every night. Sometimes when my skin gets super sensitive I use it every other night. I'm very grateful that I found this product! I suffered from acne since I was in high school, tried every hyped up product out there like proactive, bounced from one dermatologist to the other, none of them really cured my acne. So I did my own research and learned about retinol. There's a lot of retinol products out there, but I chose the green cream level 9 because it was so far the most potent. I did start with the level 6 and I advise all of you to start with the level 6 because it takes some time for the skin to get used to this product, don't use level 9 first!! try 6 then after you're done but the level 9. First time users, I would suggest to apply on face every other day for the first couple weeks, then if your skin doesn't peel anymore, you can use it every night. Apply at night time only because it works better while you sleep. First week of using it my skin peeled a little and it was kind of irritated, but it's ok it's supposed to do that! Don't be frustrated it your skin tends to get sensitive at first because I swear to you this product is so worth it if you wait 2 weeks!!! My skin got super smooth, pores and blackhead minimized, no more cystic acne! wrinkles gone! OMG i would die without this product! Buy it now!!!"
578,B000MASTM4,"Have used it for years earlier to order from Amazon I've been using this product for years and highly recommend 👍. Hydrates and leaves my skin a little tingly right after spraying on. I don't usually like anything with a fragrance, but the natural scent is great. Part of my morning routine right before I put on moisturizer. My favorite face mist off all time!!! Makes your face so dewy and fresh looking. Gives a bit of a collegen effect to skin aswell. Sort of plumps it up, in a good way!!! Highly reccommend this product!! When used with the Mychelle 'Fruit Enzyme Cleanser', it makes your skin look even more awesome. Great for men too!!! My husband steal mine. Haha. I wish they would give double the amount of mist, for the same price. That would make it really value for money. As I use it everyday, it does tent to go quite fast, for me. I switched to Mychelle when my 30-some combination skin could no longer tolerate Proactive, and became excessively dry. I wanted to switch to natural products, anyway. This toner, in combination with the other Mychelle products, has left my skin beautiful, clear, and youthful. I am pleased with this; it works well to leave my skin hydrated and smells delightful!The instructions say that you should mist your face while holding the pump 12"" from your face, but I instead use this like a traditional toner--applying it to a cotton pad, and I'm always amazed at how much is removed from ""clean"" skin after I've washed with the Mychelle fruit enzyme scrub (which is delightful, btw), or whatever face wash.The tropical skin smoother exfoliates nicely if your skin is on the dryer side and the cranberry mud mask works well for oily skin. I also occasionally use the fruit fiesta peel (with lactic acid to support youthful collagen, the label says) or the incredible pumpkin peel (enzymatic ally rich therapy for deep stimulation & detoxification, for combination skin, the label says). The clear skin serum has saved my skin from breakouts and the clear skin spot treatment takes care of little blemishes. Mychelle has been great for my skin and is worth the expense! I started using this along with the Vitamin A plus serum (for combination skin) and spot treatment from Mychelle. This is  my new favorite beauty company. Was having a major problem with adult acne flare-ups, but I also have very sensitive skin and eczema. I attribute acne clearing up primarily to the serums, but this mist gives a really nice glow, great facial moisture after drying cleansers and serums, some cleansing/tightening of pores, and calming/fading of hyperpigmentation/scarring.Pros:-Kind of works like a super gentle toner plus moisturizer-Very hydrating. Sometimes I use only this for hydrating my skin at night (I forget about putting on night cream)-Sprays on - no tugging of skin or use of fingers/things that can put gunk back on your face-Gives a healthy, bright look to skin-Natural ingredients, no animal testing, no toxic junk-Just makes your skin FEEL nice!-awesome scent - citrus, slightly sweet, not too overpowering (especially for something that goes on your face)Cons:-SLIGHT tacky feel for a short while--but I use at night or in tandem with moisturizer in the day (as the ""steps""/mychelle's directions suggest)-Tastes bad if you get it on your lips--just pull them in when spraying, or spray on your fingers to spread on. Smells sooo yummy, & has truly lived up to its claims for me. I also have the hyaluronic mist by mychelle, but this fruit enzyme one is much more moisturizing! And it has really brightened, tightened, and evened out my skin tone. I've recently converted all of my facial care products to Mychelle, & the fruit enzyme cleanser + mist are probably my favorite ones. The polypeptide cream, refining sugar cleanser, & Retinal serum would be the next 3. I actually spray this and then rub it in like a moisturizer. I feel like i get more product, & more moisturization that way. Since my skin is on the dryer side, this method works better for me. Then I spray the hyaluronic mist to set my makeup. It has cleared up blemish scars, sun spots, & has kept my pores clear! The picture for this product is of the ""New Look, Same Formula"" red bottle, but the product I received was the old blue bottle.  The ingredients are identical, so it's not a big deal, I'm just slightly annoyed because I was expecting a pretty new red bottle, because that is what all the pictures are of. I love this spray tone and have used it for years!"
579,B000VEG964,"I admit I was skeptical about this product being able to lighten the dark pigmented spots that had developed on my forty-something face but thought that I would try a peel at home rather than spend a fortune at a spa.My results? So far, after about 6 weeks of use, 3 times a week or so, I see some improvement in the dark spots, but they are definitely still there. The tone and texture of my skin does seem smoother and brighter so I do believe it is working well as an exfoliant. I do wish it had done MORE for improving pigment, but I will continue to use it and hopefully with more time it will lighten the dark spots even more.Even after 6 weeks time, I still have more than 1/2 of a bottle left, so as far as value is concerned, it is definitely worth the price of giving it a try since you will be able to give it a good long trial if you wish.IMPORTANT to note: I do NOT have overall sensitive skin and so it has not been a problem for me that this burns a bit and leaves my skin a little red and dry in a couple of apparently slightly sensitive spots. If you tend to burn easily, have an aversion to mild pain or have very dry skin, I don't know that I would try this if I were you. That being said, I am NO dermatologist, just someone who has tried a lot of products and has seen my sensitive-skinned friends do the same with painful results.I have also followed nearly every peel with the PH BALANCING toner that is also available from CELLBONE and find that this seems to stop the burning sensation, relieve the redness faster and put my face back into ""balance"" if there truly is such a thing. I would recommend purchasing them together.Lastly, if they do the same for all of their customers, you will receive some great, nearly full-sized samples of some of their other products. I have tried them out and will probably purchase a few other things from them as a result....so for the money, give it a try.I can't say you will have fabulous results but it will not cost a fortune to find out and you may love just having more radiant skin! Hi, I never write reviews, but I LOVE this product so much I had to share.  I'm 47 Years old, have enjoyed beautiful skin most of my life. My sun exposure has varied through the years.  I've vasilated from lots of sun beds to years of zero tanning.  In the last year my legs began to take on a scaly appearance that wouldn't go away.  I would exfoliate, tried a variety of over the counter creams, did an IPL twice at a medi spa and went to see my dermatologist.  She said it was normal aging skin and that's life getting old.  What???  I couldn't bare the thought of hiding my legs for the rest of my life.  That's when I got the idea to try a peel on my legs.  I began with the Cellbone 35% peel.  I used Wichhazel with a cottonball over the skin, let it dry, applied the Cellbone glycolic acid with a fan brush, waited proper amount of time, hopped in the shower rinsed like mad, dried off, applied Cellbone neutralizer, waited 5 minutes-ish rinsed with wash cloth and used Acquaphor as moisturizer.  After tremendous success, I went crazy, did my arms, my back, my face and ordered the stronger 50% and used it too.  It says it can be used 1-2x weekly.  My goals is get my skin looking great, probably another 4 peels and then back off to a 1-2x per month maintenance.  BTW, I DID do a test patch with both the 35% and 50% peels prior to slathering all over. My skin looks a good 10 years younger, its smooth, stays hydrated, has only a few of the scaly patches left (they will be gone soon)the overall tone is even, brown spots have faded or gone, and it's a prettier color, even without any tan.  I love the Cellbone products so much I ordered a bunch of stuff for my face, nightime moisurizer and more and love it all!!!!!!  Lastly, my husband who never notices anything commented that he could see a huge difference in my legs.  So naturally I had to let him in on the action!!! I have treated his 58 year old, spent a lot of time in the sun face, three times now!!!  (But with him I've stayed witht the 35%)  He looks better now than he did after a package of 3 IPL and 3 Clear Brilliant Lazers and a medi spa.  Besides the improvement, the convenience of doing this at home, I've also saved tons of $$$$$.  Honestly, I can't rave enough, it's like magic!!!  Good luck and I hope everyone else benefits like we have!!!!  Blessings to all!!! This Peel Gel is very strong. everytime I use it I end up with some sort of adverse effect. If you have never gotten a peel before I would recommend getting a lower percentage peel gel as this one will be to harsh for the skin. I do not blame the seller or the product I blame myself for I should have gotten a lesser percentage peel gel something that my face would have been able to handle.UPDATE: JANUARY 12, 2012I now realize that I did not give an impartial review on this product. Now do not get me wrong this is a STRONG PEEL! However; one should always let their skin adjust to new things before casting judgement. Here is what happened. I allowed myself to heal after the first use, I did get scald the 1st time I used it, but after the peeling process began I noticed with the underlying skin that my marks was fading and my skin had a glow. So I waited for another month and did another session I got the scald but the healing time was well worth it since the peel, today I can say that all my marks have disappeared, my pores are noticeable smaller and my skin tone is smoother, much better than it was. Now the peel isn't the only thing I was using, along with the vitamin C serum and crème and following the instructions to a T along with allowing the healing process I can truly say I am pleased with the overall results of this product. it must be working as I said it is because my sister and her daughters  are now devoted users ."
580,B0009ET4VI,"Combined with a moisturizer this has reduced my enormous pores and evened my acne scarred, mature skin. Already on my second bottle. I’m a lifer. Compares to MUCH more expensive serums. Don’t forget to shake the bottle as it does separate. Follow with a nice rich moisturizer. The first time I bought this product was at a local store--it's not impossible to find--but chose to buy it via Amazon this time because the price was better.  My (50 y/o) skin is normal-to-dry and tends toward sensitive, and does not like to absorb most lotions or serums--yet it has no problem with this.  It smells like tangy orange, which is a personal favorite scent.  Does it make my skin more radiant?  Hm...I dunno.  I haven't really noticed any significant changes in terms of my various spots going away (although, one spot did, but that might have been a different product?  I use a variety of things for skin care at random intervals, often simultaneously, making hard to pin-point what is actually being effective...), or wrinkle reduction.  But, what I do like is how light it is on my skin, making it feel slightly moisturized without any shiny/sticky/oily after-effects once applied.  Nor does it cause me to break out or react, which so many other facial lotions/serums I have tried do!  So, although I won't claim it is a beauty miracle worker wonder that cures all ills, I will keep it in my arsenal because hey!  I just really like it, and the ingredients make me think I'm helping my skin  :) Firstly I like the fact that the company does not test on animals.This stuff actually does fade sunspots, age spots- whatever you want to call them.The consistency of the product is like water, and dries relatively fast on the skin.Formula is ""green and clean""Smell is pleasantEasily layered with other serum and moisturizers It took me a while to realize what was going on, but I have come to realize after using this serum over the course of a little more than a year, that it was giving me headaches and muscle cramps in my neck! (Because whatever I put on my face, I put on my neck too.)After looking into the ingredients, I believe it is the COQ10, which is known to cause headaches and muscle cramps.I wanted to leave this review in case someone else out there has been having headaches or muscle tension in their face and neck after using this serum…It’s not you – it’s the serum! More specifically, it’s the COQ10! I am so glad I stopped using this—I feel so much better! PTL I use BWC, vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I use it AM and PM. Along with moisturizer. This is a daily routine. A friend recommended it to me. I think it has helped me. I should have more wrinkles than I do. I am 83 years old. I really like the product.  I initially purchased at a Vitamin shop chain, I liked then, is light does not have any smell or perfume, it feels clean and I feel it moisturizes nicely. (& does not have 2 inches of ingredients in the list of ingredients).  I saw it on line a bit cheaper.  I like the lotion, I think it hydrates well and is moderately priced.  I have read that Vitamin C is beneficial to Skin renewal; I have seen  (I only watch Dr Oz occasionally) in  Dr. Oz 's show two guest  guest dermatologists (confirm what I read about vitamin C) talking about the benefits of using  lotions with Vitamin C, daily skin cleaning (along with at least bi-weakly exfoliation with cleaning brush  see Dr Oz show around late Summr. 2013) how helps moisturize and nourish face's skin .I am planning to purchase the cleaning BWC lotion (meanwhile am I shopping for a reasonably priced & effective cleaning face brush) to used along with this products. Who are Not tested on animals.I recommend BWC product for the quality and the price. I will continue to use it. I like this product but arrived half empty with a broken lid with gunk all over the bottle. Perhaps this item does not ship well? Buyer beware because the main issue is that you are not able to exchange/return this particular item. 8/1/21 This product is the best my skin loves it! I use it after I wash the spray rose water o my skin. It soothes and smooths out my skin tone. All of the natural ingredients make my skin look and feel great. I’m on my second bottle."
581,B0009EILHG,"I’m turning 32 this year and have suddenly been having issues with adult acne. I bought this in hopes it would help and it has, somewhat. When I feel some pimples popping up this will dry them out within a day or two. But as fast as they disappear, I get new ones popping up elsewhere, so it’s just a vicious cycle of never ending acne lol. I like the cooling sensation but if you have dry or sensitive skin this may be a bit intense for you. Overall, I am happy with this product. I have used this since 2016 and listen here I will never change up on this product this is literally the only that helps with my breakouts aside from drinking regular old water. I tried to go one week with out it ( i.e. I ran out) and instantly regretted it. After I started back using it for two days each pimple just disappeared. I haven't been getting oily or dry in my patchy areas like I have with many face washes This is the best face wash I have found!! Will definitely be buying again Biore is my favorite brand ever! My skin is always so clear & smooth & it gets rid of dark spots as well! I’ve been using Biore since 2017 & I haven’t used any other brand since then Love how is feels after you wash. So refreshing. We've been using Biore Ice Cleanser for years and years, and it's become increasingly difficult to find in-stores. I'm so glad Amazon had it available, and for the same price we're used to paying in-store!This cleanser foams up really nice in the shower and has a light cooling effect to it that feels particularly wonderful in the summer. Leaves my skin feeling clean but not overly dried out, which is definitely a plus. There's a reason we keep buying it! Im a man, and I have been using this for years. What I love the most is that it has a smooth scent, not rough in the nose. Its citrus... ""icy"", very unisex, my wife also loves it... So its not an impact in the morning when you are still waking up. Its feels like a suave injection of sun energy.You need a small amount to wash your face. Face feels soft and bright skin.Texture is a bit creamy, not full liquid."
582,B0000VC1YC,"Producto de alta calidad Great oil. I live in dry high desert and this is a great moisturizer. Highly recommend. Lightly scented and very soothing Light, absorbs quickly, pleasant very light scent, a small amount goes a long ways. Been using this body oil for years.  It keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  It’s great in the summer as well because it’s not heavy.  Great results! We have used this product for years, then could no longer find it in the stores. It has a light lovely scent and moisturizes wonderfully. I love this product, used it for years, but unless the price is better next time I order I will be looking for something different I bought this in most part for the bottle - I always use an oil based moisturizer after the shower and it was very hard to find a pump that wouldn't leak oil all over my bathroom.The product inside this bottle is great too. I don't think it's quite as moisturizing as a pure mineral oil product (i.e. baby oil) but the smell is great - a sweeter kind of sesame seed/ sweet inoffensive sandalwood scent. The texture is a kind of dry oil feeling."
583,B0000535UX,"I love this brand and the rose soap is one of their best soaps. There is no scent. This soap doesn't dry out the skin after use.Environmentally good product.I won't use any other hand soap. I use this product regularly and like it.  One of the packages leaked in the box.  Everything is still usable, but you should know for future mailings. Thanks. This soap is a favorite of ours, but 2 of the 4 bottles we ordered arrived with open tops and soap leaking all over the box. Further, the soap is much more watery than the ones we've bought at the grocery store, so I am questioning if it's legitimate. Rice hand soap and sent and moisturizer at a good price Great when you need to wash often.  Not as drying as other hand soaps. I love Jason hand soaps and have been using them for years.  Nice variety of scents; gentle and effective hand cleanser.The reason for only four stars is because of the pump.  Often I need to use the pump from a previous container because I cannot get the pump of the new ones to open.  This has been happening only with bottles I've purchased on line (not with the bottles purchased pre-covid, when I could go to the natural food store to purchase).Updated: I still very much like Jason handsoap, and used to purchase exclusively from a local natural food store; now I purchase online.  The most recent batch of Jason teatree handsoap received is thinner - clearly has a higher water content - than previous purchases.  This is rather disappointing. The soap is expensive, but when at its normal thickness can still be cost-effective; the thin/watered down version is not. No seal on item.It was advertised as body washed , arrived as hand soap🤷🏼‍♀️"
584,B000PILEWA,"Love the natural lavender EO smell of this soap. Have been using it for laundry and cleaning around the house. I appreciate that the scent is present when you’re using it, but doesn’t linger once it’s dried. I use it in hand foam dispensers. It cleans great and leaves a pleasant scent. I love that it's a soap without harmful ingredients. Nice Versitle I use it in the bath. Smells good. Goes a really long way. Just a couple drops! Love the product but never received it Holistic soap. I have used Dr Bronner's highly concentrated, non-toxic, biodegradable, liquid soap for decades. I use it for laundry, household cleaning, liquid hand soap, and dish soap. I typically purchase it in the 32-ounce size, buying four containers at a time. I had not previously purchased it in the gallon size because it is not always true that, when you buy the jumbo-size of a product, it is actually cheaper ounce per ounce. In the case of this particular product, that is actually the case. I purchased this specific one because I purchased a smaller bottle of it and loved it. This gallon does not smell the exact same as the smaller bottle (of exact formula). I could smell the sweet almond in the smaller bottle and even my guests that used it complimented the soap scent. This larger bottle has a faint almond scent and has a slightly weird medicinal after scent, I can't really explain it. It's not horrible at all because it is faint but I'm slightly disappointed that it's not what I was expecting. Overall though, it cleans well and doesn't over dry my hands."
585,B000146L62,"Hard to find bar soap that smells like clove, just wish it was a little stronger in fragrance. Yes, I will buy it again! It smells like cinnamon and is good for winter cuz it makes u feel hot from the spice. Its should be blended  with milky cream to make it more soothing so i really wouldnt buy it again. I've been on a spa-at-home kick lately and particularly interested in natural spa products.  I came across Plantlife products when I was looking for some aromatherapy candles (which I bought from them and I deeply love).  When I received the candles I got two small free samples - this soap and a bottle of lavendar oil.  After trying out the soap, I immediately purchased 3 larger bars of a few different scents, including this one.  All the soaps I bought have the wonderful fragrances I expected when I picked them out - peppermint, lavendar, etc., but I love the Cassia Clove smell - it has a unique earthy smell, but is not overpowering at all.  The bar is solid and a perfect size for what you pay.  When you lather it on, it glides across your skin without a whole lot of foam and fuss, but you can still see a trail of the natural oils that it is made from.  It is gentle, but leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh and very soft.  I am hooked on all of these soaps and have started purchasing many of the different products that Plantlife makes. I can't say enough positive things about Plantlife soaps.I came to natural soaps for a very specific reason--a husband whose eczema was virtually out of control.  For years, we'd tried keeping him on soaps designed for sensitive skin.  While this would generally calm flare-ups slightly, it wouldn't prevent them from creeping up again.  Admittedly, since beginning to use Plantlife's soaps, my husband is NOT eczema free... BUT his skin is drastically improved and his flare-ups are down to about 10% of what they once were.The scents of Plantlife's soaps are remarkably pleasant too.  I've yet to find one that is offensive to my nose--they're delicately done, not over-powering or too ""perfume-y.""So if you're thinking of switching to herbal soaps to treat your skin to the best, most natural clean possible--try some Plantlife soaps.  If you're simply looking for some aromatherapy or some way to mix-up your usual soap routine--try some Plantlife soaps.  I'd be willing to bet that if you returned to ""normal,"" store-bought soaps afterwards, you'd do so grudgingly and reluctantly! I like how it cleanse my skin and made my skin feel very refreshed I like the performance of this soap. I wish it smelled more like clove and less than cinnamon. I LOVE this soap!!! The smell reminds me of Christmas, year 'round. The warm aroma calms me and makes me feel peaceful. The lather is rich and creamy. My sensitive skin gets pampered by this soap, and the scent stays on my skin long after the shower. Definitely a 5-star soap, but I had to give it 4 stars because it melts away so quickly that the thrill doesn't last. It's not practical for me to pay $5 bucks for one bar of soap that doesn't last, but it's a lovely occasional treat. At first I was going to give this a lower review because I could only smell the cinnamon and not the clove, but after a few uses, the clove really comes through. Excellent soap that lathers well and I would buy again."
586,B001EWETAK,"I've got those nasty, pimply bumps all over my upper arms and rib cage.  I have tried EVERYTHING to clear it up and nothing ever worked... really everything.  I bought this cream months ago because I'm trying to stay away from artificial garbage and used it once.  I hated the smell.  I shoved the tub into a drawer and forgot about it.  I rediscovered it during spring cleaning a couple of weeks ago and thought, what the hey?  I'll try it again... more than once to see if it works.Guess what?  Yes To Carrots works!  I still don't like the smell... it is a bit too strong for me... BUT I will never stop using this cream.  My skin is buttery soft!!  After just a couple of days my upper arms felt smooth!!  I couldn't believe it.  You can still see the red spots (I don't think those will go away) but my arms FEEL smooth and that's all I care about.  I'm so very, very happy!  This also works miracles on my elbows.I took a star off because I don't like the smell, but other than that this is a fabulous cream.  It is worth the price for what it does and for the quality of ingredients.  I think the reason Yes to Carrots helps my Keratosis is because of the Dead Sea Minerals in it.  The only time in my life that the KP on my arms was even remotely clear was during childhood summers spent swimming in the ocean in Florida.  I'm far away from there now, but love the fact that I can bring sea minerals to my skin in this wonderful, rich cream.Yay for Yes To Carrots!!  :) I love this product but the package size is incorrect, you get less than described.  The item description is 2 tubs of 8.45 oz each & is also shown in the picture.  However the size I received was 2 tubs of 6 oz each.  Not as good a deal as advertised. I have used many different types of body creams. this is the best because the butter is not greasy and does not stain clothing. It will last longer than most body butter creams, and it has a nice fragrance to it. It seems to work for my skin type the best. It might just be my body chemistry? My choice for personal use. I love the soothing cucumber scent it is gentle and dissapates after use.  I feel like I am pampering my body when I use it.  I can see and feel immediate moisture without feeling greasy. I have extremely dry skin ,especially during the winter months.  I was reading a magazine one day and saw this body butter recommended by one of the stars on ""Brothers and Sisters"".  I tried it and I love it.  It goes on so smooth and doesn't feel greasy.  Your skin feels so soft and dry skin is gone.  I had never found a body lotion that worked for dry skin until this one and it's made from all natural ingredients which is a plus! I would highly recommend this to anyone. I already use this brands face lotion and misc other make up products so I thought this body butter would be great too. In all honesty, it's not very ""rich"" or ""nourishing"" feeling. It's kinda thin and not very moisturizing. I've stopped using it for awhile because my skin was starting to feel dry. I was looking for natural made creams and I came across this one. It's not wonderful but It feels nice. The original formula for this lotion was the best lotion on the planet. Unfortunately it has changed. It is thinner. If anyone knows how to purchase the original formula please share."
587,B0009MSHR2,"Great product helped my texture a lot but not much with dark spots Super fast shipping!! I absolutely love this soap!! It’s the only soap that keeps my skin clear!! This is a great soap that I have been using for years as a facial product.  It leaves my face moisturized and clear. Been using this soap for years...this is the real deal! I don't want to speak too soon, as I have only been using this product for 3 days... however, so far I am SUPER impressed.  I bought this soap because I have really horrible pregnancy acne and have tried EVERYTHING that is safe to try.  I had never heard of this soap until a few weeks ago and decided to get it right away.  I have to say, I have noticed a pretty significant difference in my skin, mostly the redness has subsided.  I am hoping the more I use it, the more it will continue to work!... fingers crossed..... I have tried nearly all of the black soaps.  I love this one.  Don't think this soap is just for Africans.  I have used this for years since I discovered it.  It suds great, is gentle on the skin, yet DOES clean.  I have used it on the toughest stains on my clothes and it works well above other products.  And the best is it doesn't leave any bad after ""stink"".  I have used this for presents many times.  And, this is about the best deal you will get. My son enjoyed using this soap."
588,B000SIGZB2,"I love this soap!! The packaging was a little beat up when I received it, but the soap inside was fine. Would order again. I like the Yardley product. It works well for me Used Yardley since childhood. In my over decades of living my life and buying different brands of soaps worldwide this soap bar is exceptional.  I’m a believer.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Smells great and lasts ages.  Lovely creamy texture too. It smells wonderful and lasts a long time. The scent is good. For showering  it's too big & slippery A great long lasting soap bar that last for a long time in your shower and makes you feel so clean and smelling wonderful like lavender. I love it."
589,B001ET727U,"This product is very fragrant a little expensive I think this stuff is great.  I like the smell of Patchouli (in SMALL doses) but actually don't think it smells that much like Patchouli with the lime mixed in, I think it has a nice unique smell though kind of masculine.  If you are unsure, just smell this stuff at a store first, its a matter of taste here for sure.  It is pretty thick but absorbs well, I think its better in the winter as its pretty heavy. I like patchouli and lime, felt the lotion was a bit watery and seeing that as the first ingredient I can see why. I make my own lotion and wanted to try this. If you like a watery lotion this would be fine, I prefer a thicker, richer lotion. The smell lasts quite a while and passes to clothing. This is a high quality lotion, but who ever was in charge of adding the fragrance had either little to no sense of smell or had a terrible cold that day!  If only they cut back on the scent then It would truly be a 5-star product! Delivery on this product was perfect.  I got it when promised.  I have the lavender lotion as well.  Love this product because it doesn't have the harmful parabens and chemicals that other lotions have.  I use all of Dr. Bronner's products and love the smell.  Because I'm sensitive to heavy fragrance this product doesn't overpower you and leaves after awhile which is good for someone who can't stand heavy smells. I was hoping this would have a nice strong scent to mask the cooking oil-like smell of my aloe vera oil, and it definitely does. They actually mix well together for what I think is the perfect moisturizer, and the heavy patchouli scent is much more understated and wearable when diluted, in my opinion. The lotion has a great, smooth consistency on its own, and it smells wonderful, it's just statement-making strong. This used to be my absolute favorite lotion!!  Everyone commented on how good I smelled when I was wearing it.  Now people say it smells like I have Vicks on.  The formula must have changed? Bought this for a friend. Tried it out and the scent is very strong.  When I wear patchouli I want it to be a little on the subtle side and this product is quite strong."
590,B000BIVY24,"Use it every time I blow dry my hair! I was happy to see this product once again available, but I think it may be a reformulated version of the original  B&B Hair Tonic.  If I use the recommended amount of product, my hair gets limp & greasy really quickly- so I started spraying 1-2 pumps into my hands & running my fingers through my hair, from mid-length to ends.  Doing this, it makes my hair shiny & silky.  So it takes some trial & error, but I really like it! I had a little sample of this and loved it so got this big one. I use it when my scalp is dry after I wash it and it’s very soothing. I just started going to a new salon and my stylist recommended this product for freshening my hair between washes and detangling. I'm honestly not sure what the heck a ""pre-styler"" is supposed to be, but a little dry shampoo and about three spritzes of this lotion primer run through my hair wet really does a great job of freshing up my hair between washes. I love the scent lemon grass and tea tree oil combo. The primer/pre-styler dries soft, adding a little shine to the hair. No grease, oil or residue. I like it enough I usually use it on my hair on days I wash it as well. The tea tree oil helps enoucrage good scalp health and helps with dry scalp issues.It appears quite a few people ended up with the wrong product when they bought this. Bumble and Bumble make a tonic lotion AND a tonic lotion ""primer."" This review is for the primer, which is what I recieved in ordering. The packing on the two products is almost identical as well as the price. Double check before you click order!Update: I’ve been using this product for a while now and still love it. But I found out that, personally, I can dilute it by a half with water and it doesn’t change what it does to my hair at all. At 20-25 dollars a pop this might be a good solution for those on a budget. this product is great! I’ve been using it for years. I love it! This hair tonic is great for refreshing your hair. It has a fresh clean smell so you have that just showered feeling. I love this product!  I was just about out, and decided this I could not do without.  After a great shampoo, a spray makes life much easier and my hair is very easy to work with, without being limp and lifeless.  Love B&b products, have not been disappointed. While the product is as described and works the same as the one I have used for a while, the bottle leaked in shipping. Most of the product is still inside but a better packaging method would be appreciated if I am to buy again from this supplier."
591,B0009EILI0,"I was skeptical at how affective this product would be especially bc I had a ton of blackheads in the hardest area, creases of my nose. I couldn’t cover it up with make up bad. I used one strip and I couldn’t believe how many it removed. My nose was almost clear good. I was like omg finally!!! It leaves a sticky residue afterwards which you need to rinse off which is fine bc you want to treat any redness left behind with a cleanser or lotion but I can’t rave enough about how amazing this product is! There is two bands in the box at that. One for your nose and one for your face which I forgot about and you’ll notice it by how it fits so check to see if it’s nose or face before putting it on. I want to say after 3 strips the sides of my nose are clear. I noticed after I used a cleanser before it the smaller black heads showed up better giving the strip more leverage to pull them out. So if you have small ones use a cleanser first then the strip. It’ll get the big ones without cleanser as long as your skin is lightly wet. If your nose is too wet it’ll slip a bit when you put it on and take longer to dry. If anything the biggest thing is lightly wet your nose then make sure it is officially hardened otherwise it won’t grab a lot out. The stickiness afterwards is easy to get rid of with a cleanser. It is freaking amazing to have clear sides on my nose and have extras I didn’t really pay much attention to come out that were on the top of my nose. It will get ones on the bottom of your nose out but you gotta make sure you have it on right. Honestly I’ve never paid much attention to the rest of my nose seeing no one is going to study your entire nose, but after how it cleared up the sides of my nose  (got 2 small ones left barely noticeable) I’m going to try and clear up the rest. Why not right? I’ll sum up this rant with I avoid all cost at touching my nose now that it’s clear I rarely write reviews. But, because it took me so long to find a product that actually works, I had to!!!The picture says it all. Just follow the instructions, Make sure the area is wet before applying the strips, I left it on for 15 minutes, peel gently and it won't be painful or leave any marks. I have a very sensitive skin and this product worked perfectly. I purchased these to help me get my skin back. Part of that process involves reducing my blackheads. I hoped this would help me clear some of my stubborn blackheads before applying a product that would help me keep them clear. While this did clear some of the blackheads, it left a lot behind, too. It also hurt, and was kind of messy to use. You also have to be diligent in how you apply these and keep smoothing it out on your skin, or it will naturally start to crease and leave areas of your skin untouched where the strip creases away from your skin. Even if you are diligent, once you peel it away, it leaves a lot to be desired. This may work better for someone whose skin is younger (I’m in my mid-30s and losing elasticity), and who has much larger pores/blackheads. Be mindful that you also have to wait about 15-20 minutes to allow the strip to dry before you take this off, so work that time into your skincare routine if you give this a try. This was my first time using this, and it will probably be my last. I feel like there are more effective and less painful ways to clear your pores. I really like these and like the brand.  They can be expensive but am afraid to try a cheaper alternative. No complaints. Does it’s job. I was curious to try these and I think they worked fairly well, especially on my nose. They stick very well. I guess I didn’t have too many black or white heads. Nonetheless, I think this product is worth the try. Good product but damaged packaging Works better than I expected. Wish they were wider or a whole mask."
592,B000HBNAJK,i use this oil on my hair and honestly not only it smells good but it helps with my hair being soft. it mentions that you can warm this oil for your hair but i haven’t done that yet! i’m use to this oil and i like it. Been using for years! na None I buy this over and over and over.  Makes my skin so soft Very moisturizing and has a really nice calming scent :) It is exactly as described but when I received the package some of the oil was already spilling out. I have used this oil for a number of years and I feel it is a quality product.
593,B00127S53E,"Price is right for what you get scent isn't too strong also wish it lathered more but overall good product Great product I don’t like girly sents and have lots of allergies .  This product was great smell/cleaning / no skin issues Great product! Good price and Smells, foams and cleans great. I do wish the ""cooling"" sensation was stronger. Regalo navidad Like the smell"
594,B000QFCQCO,"Smells great but slightly irritating for sensitive skin Have seen improvement when using regularly, not so dark an noticable. Give it a thumbs UP I love this cream and its texture. I feel that it takes away fine lines.It has a beautiful fragrance too! I have been using the Avalon Organics Vitamin C products for a number of years but recently tried the CoQ10 serum.  I've liked that so thought I would give the creme a try.  First off, like other reviewers, I had problems with the product not pumping properly.  I unscrewed the lid and looked inside.  At first, I thought that the tube that runs from the pump down through the bottle was missing.  I looked at my bottle of serum and it also does not have a tube.  Somehow, as the pump is pressed and product is released, the bottom of the bottle moves up.  I've had two bottles of serum so far and this process has worked fine.  I had to transfer the contents of this bottle into another container to use the product.  And since the bottle is so stiff, this is not an easy task.  Anyway, I can't say that I like this creme any more than the Vit C line, so am unlikely to re-order, especially if there will be problems getting the product to pump properly. The cream itself is incredible. I see instant and lasting results with every use. My skin is so soft and smooth and my fine lines are disappearing rapidly. As far as the pump is concerned, yes, the tube inside is dinky, but if you store the bottle upside down (just stand it on its lid) it pumps just fine if you also hold it upside down while pumping some out. The scent is a little stronger but dissipates fairly quickly to my nose, which is very sensitive. I have been using this on my face for several years. Always in a red bottle & consistently the same.  Love it!  My skin likes it and is  more moist in the morning.  In winter I will add a heavier moisturiser over it (wish Avalon made one).  The rose fragrance is nice but I'd like some other clean scent as long as it was light.  I am not fond of no scent or heavy scent. So, this is okay.  My skin is healthier, bar none! Without the bad chemicals which is a major priority. I've used this product for many years, ever since I visited my daughter and she remarked how smooth  and nice my facial skin  looked. Well, my daughter is very picky and not free with commpliments, so I knew she really meant it. At that point I'd been using the day cream for about 6 months. So when I saw the night cream, I immediately ordered it. This night cream  is not thick and sticky and I do not wake up with a greasy face. I also enjoy using the day cream, I think it has something to do with the Q-10 ingredient. I have many allergies anf this cream works well on my sensitive skin. And better yet, the price is a bargain. I have used Avalon organics creme for a few years now, and I really like it.  I have always just used the day time creme (didn't have the whole line).  So, I decided to give the rest of the product line a try.  I was expecting the night time creme to be thicker than the day time one?  But it is actually thinner, and of course has no sun block.  So I sometimes use it on icky, winter days, when I don't feel like having a thicker layer on my skin.  It feels fresher to me and absorbs nicely.  So, I guess this isn't my night time creme...it's my winter day's creme :)  I will buy this product again when I run out."
595,B001ET73JM,"I have been using Face Wash by Cetaphil, Daily Facial Cleanser for Combination to Oily Sensitive Skin, 16 Ounce for several months now and it has become my go-to facial cleanser. This product is a game-changer for anyone with sensitive, combination, or oily skin.This facial cleanser is very gentle on my skin and does not leave my face feeling tight or dry after use. It is formulated to clean deep into my pores, removing all dirt and impurities, while also preventing breakouts.The 16-ounce bottle is very convenient and lasts for a long time. I love the pump feature that makes it easy to dispense the right amount of product without wasting any.This face wash is fragrance-free and hypoallergenic, making it perfect for people with sensitive skin. It is also non-comedogenic, meaning it does not clog pores.Overall, I would highly recommend Face Wash by Cetaphil, Daily Facial Cleanser for Combination to Oily Sensitive Skin, 16 Ounce to anyone in need of a reliable facial cleanser. This product is gentle yet effective and has helped me to maintain a healthy, glowing complexion. The only facial cleanser I use now! Cleans without stripping skin of moisture. Gentle and effective. I’ve used Cetaphil for my face for many years now. It’s non-comedogenic. I use this product before applying the Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer. I’ve been using this product since I was in high school, so about 5 years. And it’s the best thing that has happened to me. It cleared my face up very quick. First off: They changed the formula. Last year it was thicker and seemed to clean a little bit better. Now it's thinner, but still does a good job at cleansing. I prefer the old version. The newer version is nice though. I have very sensitive skin. This product is gentle, not over-drying (but not moisturizing either), leaves no residue feeling, and rinses off easily. It washes off my face makeup (I use eye makeup remover so I can't vouch for that). It has little to no scent. I use it twice daily. This is not the product that was pictured. This is for oily/sensitive skin. The product in the picture is normal to oily skin! I can’t even return this. Very frustrating. Do not buy. Amo ese jabón porque es muy noble con mi piel, me mantiene libre de acne y no me deja la piel acartonada, no tiene olor fuerte y cada frasco me dura mucho tiempo, así que su relación de precio y uso es muy buena. As the subject states: don't let the packaging fool you. Yes, this looks like the cheapest (and it is), lowest quality face soap. But I went to my derm because I was having issues with my skin (very extreme dryness). She said that I was actually having an allergic reaction to my face soap (a super fancy one), and she put me on a steroid cream for two days, and then recommended this soap. That was a year ago. Everything has been amazing since then. And my beauty regime costs have plummeted! I definitely can use the extra money right now."
596,B001E96OHO,"This is the only cleanser that works for me. I've been using this Neutrogena cleanser for a couple of years now but this's the first time I bought it from Amazon. The pack of 3 is great value for money since they sell these at nearly $8 at Safeways and $6.50(if you catch of on discount) at drug stores. I love the tingling feeling the cleanser gives me while washing my face (is that good or bad?) and my face always feels so fresh and clean afterwards. I've tried lots and lots of other more expensive cleansers but had to come back to Neutrogena deep clean. You would definitely need moisturizer afterwards if you have normal skin like me though. Highly recommended. there is a difference between this cleanser and the ""neutrogena deep clean foaming cleanser"" (if i remember the name correctly) that looks almost exactly identical to this one except for that one word.i love this cream cleanser--i like the feel of it (it stays put on your face almost like a mask but rinses off easily), it does a great job cleansing my face without drying it out, and it lasts a long time (you only need to use a tiny bit each time).  i've got normal skin, but would also recommend it to people with oily skin (just use more than the dime size drop that i use). I have been using this product for several years. The last time I tried to find it, it seemed that it had been discontinued, which was very disheartening. This is great for women over 50 who have started to get dry skin and light wrinkling. I'm 73 and it keeps my wrinkles at bay. My friends tell me I could pass for late 40's. I don't have any crows feet and my skin is very smooth. I always use a moisturizer, which is Pond's Dry Skin cream. I hope no one catches on that this product (Pond's) is every bit as good as the astronomically priced skin creams. I love this cleaner for my face . It really does deep clean and it didn't break my face out in the introduction .Any one who have a skin problem should try it . You will be pleased BEWARE!!! Neutrogena, without telling anyone, changed the formula on this cleanser. I've used this happily for over 8 years and ordered a new shipment recently. The texture, smell and efficacy has changed dramatically and even makes my skin burn now. Not sure why a company would so drastically change a product WITH NO WARNING and make it terrible. If you look online, there is negative feedback everywhere about how they've ruined a good thing with this new version. It's the New Coke... and I hope it goes away soon. I returned the cleanser and wanted to warn everyone about to buy this, thinking it's what they're used to. It isn't! This is my favorite cleanser.  My skin is very subject to reactions, drying, breakouts to cleansers and moisturizers. NEVER a problem with this product, and my skin is soft and healthy when I use it. I love this cleanser. It makes my face tingle a liitle and feels so soft and clean after rinsing. I have tried many products but none have left my skin feeling so good."
