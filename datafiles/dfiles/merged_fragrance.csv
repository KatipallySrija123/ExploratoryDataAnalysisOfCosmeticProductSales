pleasantly surprised choosing scent description accurately described use cologne everyday campus get compliment guy friend come door use cologne smell fresh,"Nautica Voyage By Nautica For Men Eau De Toilette Spray, 100 ml"," I have just recently decided to get into the habit of dressing  better and fragrances.  While I'm not the marketed age range for this fragrance, I talked to many friends and have seen many Youtubers recommend this . I decided to give it a try.  Let me tell you I love it. Its a great work or Spring time cologne,The reviewers were correct.  I love the fresh scent and the longevity last at least 6 to 8 hours. Its not too weak but not too strong either. The price for this stuff is excellent as well. This is a great daytime scent for work .  Everyman man should have this in their collection.The company who shipped this too me as excellent as well. Only reason I don't give this a 5 star, is because I know their are better fragrances out there. But for a safe, reliable scent..This stuff rocks. My only regret is discovering this late in life . But better late than never. 3 sprays on the neck (sides & nape), 1 spray on each wrist and BAM! Fresh-out-of-the-shower scent for the next 6-8 hours that won't overpower people's noses. Gave the scent 4 stars since you simply can't compare it to higher end fresh/masculine fragrances like Profondo or Sauvage for example. But it's a very solid scent, lasts all day, and for 20 bucks it's not hard to see why it's the top seller on Amazon. Check this one out, fellas! I've never written an Amazon review before. That's how floored I am by this fragrance. Everything about it is just wonderful and pleasant.The second I took the cap off I couldn't help but smile. That is how pleasant the scent it. I sprayed one spritz into the cap and aired it out which only further cemented my first impressions. I've only worn it out once so far, but boy could I not stop smiling and feeling confident all day for the life of me.The bottle is lovely and high quality (in my opinion) for how cheap it all is. Presentation pairs perfectly for the scent which is even lovelier. I would absolutely 110% recommend this fragrance.Scents are interesting because everyone has a different perspective of them. Some people like the smell of fresh cut grass, others hate it. Where one person smells a plain cup of coffee, another smells that scent and pictures home where their dad would have the same cup of coffee every morning.So that being said, I would have to describe this fragrance as the after shower glow smell. I don't mean immediately coming out of the shower. And I definitely don't mean that this scent smells like any generic shower gel. This fragrance is the definition of fresh and clean. It smells like how you smell and feel 10-20 minutes after stepping out of the shower. Crisp, refreshed, clean, confident. It does this while also smelling like a man taking a leisurely stroll down the docks, observing all the yachts that are tied up.Stop reading reviews and buy this fragrance, you will not be disappointed. And if on the off chance you are, it was only $20 and I can guarantee you can find somebody in your life that would love to have this fragrance gifted to them, or would happily buy it from you for the same price you paid for it. I am not big into cologne, however, it us more of an ""etiquette"" to have cologne on in formal and semi formal situations. It would be an over kill to spend $60 or more on a cologne, at the same time, inexpensive cologne tend to smell ""cheap"" by having strong chemical and even alcohol scent.With my last cologne running out, I reluctantly search for an inexpensive yet ""ok"" cologne, that's when this specific one shows up on many reviews sites along with its 90,000+ reviews. The price tag of less than $35 for a bottle of nearly 7 Oz is a STEAL. I did not expect much, and was even ready to use the Amazon ""free return"" if needed to.Upon open the bottle, my first thought was ""oh, the bottle is at least glass!"". The scent though is actually nice! The scent smell ""young"" not like the cologne your grandpa would be using. It is also rather light, so you will not make people sitting next to you in subway pass out. You can increase ""strength"" of the scent depending on how much more you use. I tend to spray about 3 to 4 under my shirt, then I would be smell nicely the rest of the day. I did spray 5 to 6 times one day and the whole office smelled like me the rest of the day.Overall I recommand this cologne for those who needs one yet does not want to sell a kidney for a decent one. At the same time, you wouldn't be making others who share an enclosed space with you to suffocate."
1,B001FWXISS,love absolutely love scent husband always getting compliment wear scent last long time love wear time favorite cologne found everything cologne pretty good not amazing definitely goodit good lasting power decent projectioni also think smell quite good manly bit powdery overall pleasant like smooth fragrance splash spice intense euphoria added collection intense offer different scent signature euphoria one enjoy find last day probably considered best suited autumn winter softness work occasion time year amazon price unmatched free shipping option intense euphoria must 45 star good office scent great longevity close skin projection definitely not offend anyone work good work ck,Calvin Klein intense euphoria for Men Eau de Toilette,"I tried to order a another bottle and they said that they were out of stock. It smells pretty good, but doesn’t seem to last like the product I purchased locally. Even if I splash it on it doesn’t really seem to work that well. The CK product my wife bought is very long lasting and only requires a single spray. I can’t conscientiously recommend this product. I have my doubts that it’s legit. I usually only like subtle type colognes as I really do not like the overpowering of any smell wether its pleasant or not. Though this is more potent then what I'm used too (Like Burberry Brit), I found that after a about a half hour it is much less overbearing without completely fading out (lasted all day into to the early night). Though I would have to say that I feel this is definately more of an evening scent (or special occasions), I do not mind putting it on in the mourning for the day every once in while. I always get compliments wearing this one and what I like most is that no one I know seems to have or even know about it. I also got it half off on Amazon (though the third party seller was Fragerancenet.com; a reputable online dealer). I have no doubt that it is legit due to third party seller and the fact that it lasts as long as the original one I purchased directly from Macys a year ago.I would most definately recommend this cologne to anyone looking to smell great but not to overwhelming. People that are saying this is fake; probably didn't buy it directly from Amazon and bought it from a third party marketplace.  I originally tried this out at Macy's and loved the way it smelled.  However, I was not willing to pay $80+ for it.  I came home and did an Amazon search for it and found it way cheaper by $40+ (That was 5 years ago though) through Amazon.com LLC.  Yes, I've had this bottle for 5 years already and the cologne is just as good as it was the first day I bought it.  I've seen a lot of guys apply cologne on their clothes but it's supposed to go on your body.  I usually apply two squirts on each wrist and then rub some around my neck every morning before heading into the office.  You will probably want to apply some more if you plan on going out in the evening though. This is not about the product, but the delivery.Package delivered with a dent on the cap, as seen on the picture.  Luckily the bottle was not broken, so I will use it as it is.  Amazon must pay attention to having packages not tossed around. I have had quite a few colognes over the decades.  From time to time my favorite one shifts (and companies also stop making certain brands and come out with new ones).  At the present time I have about 14 varieties, and this one is clearly my favorite.  And yes there is a difference between Klein's Euphoria and Intense Euphoria.  The ""intense"" variety smells spicier, obviously stronger, and if I ignore throwing out fancy terms I don't quite understand, I think for a men's fragrance, it has an extremely erotic odor, which will last all day.  Of course not all women (or men) like the exact same fragrance (and there are always a few who claim they can't stand any cologne at all).  But if you want to maximize your chance of smelling good for some particular female in your life, or just for everyone around you, if you haven't experienced this you should definitely give it a try. The only fragrance you’ll ever need. Great fast shipping,good price and an amazing scent no problems with the package"

fragrance lightly layered flower hint chocolate,"Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker for Women, Eau de Parfum, 3.4-Ounce Spray Bottle","I usually wear sweet perfumes and this one is not very sweet but with the notes and the were they work together it quickly became my number one choice. I wear it every day. I am very happy with the product and the packaging. I will be ordering another from them before I run out. Smells great! Not has long lasting has it should be. I blind bought this and it wasn't for me.  BUT, if you like Estee Lauders Pleasures, that is what this reminds me of. Very floral.  Fragrance seems to stay the same as the first spray with no changes during dry down.  I overlooked the reviews that said this smells like an old lady - I have to agree with that, at least it does on my skin.**UPDATE** I didn't give this a chance further then the initial spray.  This does start out strong with lilac (to me & ""old lady perfume"" lol, but it really does settle into a beautiful fresh scent.  I keep getting whiffs of a fresh scent throughout the day when wearing.  For me, it settles into a nice just showered, washed my hair, smelling all good, scent. I have purchased SJP Lovely in the past, and the scent hasn't changed. The box came sealed in the factory cellophane wrap, and the box was placed in another clear bag from the seller as well. Well done. Es fresco limpio sutil elegante Lovely has been a favorite of mine for years. The scent is clean, long lasting and distinct. Very satisfied with this purchase. Has a soft fragrance that is not overpowering just pleasant and stays on all day Purchased based on ingredients - never smelled it. At first, I didn't like it (sprayed in air) but after wearing it, I absolutely adore this fragrance.  I DO smell LOVELY!  Definitely recommend."

Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Fl Oz,"Es una vulgar imitación de mala calidad, la primera vez que la compre me llego bien, esta segunda vez ni se parece el color de la botella, la textura es diferente, la fragancia es diferente y no dura nada. This Scent Is BoldThere's No Way You Can Walk Past A Female and Her Not Take Notice To Your Scent. Recomendado I like One of my favorite suttle smelling colognes. It's good to have it in your rotation. Okay. So I've read some reviews of people worried this may be the bootleg version of the colone which had me nervous, but I ordered it anyway hoping they were wrong and it IS THE REAL BRAND. So hope that helps some of you. I have been wearing Paris Hilton (for men) for years and know the product very well and its scent and would know the diffrence.Anyway, this cologne is superior to my Hollister so cal, and rue 21 red and half the price. Paris Hilton has been my all time favorite for a long time, and I got tired of paying $40-$50 for the others. The scent is very strong, so you don't have to spray as much making the bottle last longer. Also, the scent stays on you all day and does not fade. It smells like a more expensive cologne, and women absoloutely love it. After experimenting with other colognes, I cant beleive I ever stopped buying this stuff and forgot about it. After I opened it and sprayed some on my arm the scent brought back memories, which is why I say I would know if it was fake. If your on the fence, just buy it. You will not regret it, and it is better than the more expensive colognes at the mall. Im still surprised its less than $25. It's perfect I was always fond of this cologne when I was younger and even as an adult. The scent was better than i remembered. It’s a perfect light Clean scent but aso lasts about 6-7 hours of wear. For the price you can’t beat it. I tend to be a little more liberal with the sprays, 5-7 to be exact and it’s never over powering. Big compliment getter."

And I was like, this is unacceptable. Do not buy, it clearly degrades over time and is a total waste of money. This is the cologne my daddy used on a day to day basis.  It has a soft masculine scent. It smells nice. I purchase this every 3 months via subscription just to make sure I never run out. My dad passed away 2 yrs ago, that is why. I definitely see what people mean by ""old school"". It definitely smells like something I smelled growing up. Very masculine, not bad at all. I sprayed a few sprits on myself and it definitely reminds me of the original old spice/halstone type vibe. It's quite strong at first, but I think it will get milder and probably more aged and smell even more masculine as the hours fade. Will update after a few days."

It is ""de toilette,"" so that confirms it--not so potent.I bought this while searching for a signature scent, but this isn't quite it. I keep it in my travel bag.

Now that I have gotten it, yes its OK, but not what I hoped for. First of all, the box and lid had a strong plastic/chemical smell. I threw out the box, and after a couple days the odor seems to largly have left the lid. The bottle, by the way, is very attractive. Now for the scent: its not that it smells bad, but rather that it seems sort of synthetic/chemical, and also vanishes rather quickly I thought. That said when I asked family, they said it smelled OK. Also, I have only smelled it on myself--maybe I'd like it on someone else. In short--if it works for you, great, but next time I'd buy ""Fresh Vibes"" or ""Moves"" both by Adidas. The package arrived well protected and quickly. It contained the box and the perfume inside. One of the better fragrances I've tried.  It doesn't have the cloying scent so may have.  It smells nice and has staying power. (Unlike some that come on strong and fade quickly).  It lasts a long time and doesn't turn 'sour'.  I've ordered this a few times and will order again soon.  If you have passed up colognes/perfumes because of the scent that buries you, I recommend you try this one.  It didn't affect my allergies either. :) Pros: It smells good, kind of a floral base mix with fruits and air freshener. So it smells 'clean'.Cons: It lasts 2 maybe 3 hours at best for me. So, I would have to keep it in my purse and keep spraying every few hours to even smell any scent when I press my nose against where I last sprayed the perfume on my clothes. So, you WILL go through the bottle fairly quickly. It might as well be a .5 ounce of regular long lasting perfume. But the 1.7 ounce is diluted and therefore it is not strong.Because of the price, I say go buy a long lasting perfume, or if you are okay with carrying the bottle around and okay with spraying yourself every now and then, go for it!Best- Love I found this eau de toliet spray while working as a retail manager of large discount store. It is a very light,unique smell. It does not come on strong or overpower ones ability to breathe. I highly recommend thiseau de toliet spray. Very refreshing. I have had many people ask me what I am wearing and complimentme. My grandchildren say ""that is your smell, Nonna"". Do not be turned off by the last sentence. This eaude toliet spray is not age specific. My granddaughters sneak and use it as frequently as possible! I absolutely love the Adidas Moves, so I decided to try this product and it is now my new favorite.  It is such a clean smell which I am finding that Adidas products are. I highly recommend this product!!  I am fairly picky about the fragrances I wear because I easily get headaches from many scents but Adidas has never been one of them.  Try it, you will like it and if you don't you can contact me and sell me what you don't like!!!  LOL!!! :) This fragrance is called ""Floral Dream"" for a reason --- It literally smells like you're walking through a garden! It smells very nice, however, it is just not the right smell for me. My sister is a floral fanatic so I decided to give this to her and she LOVES it. Would recommend for any other lovers of flowery perfume!"

I am always surprised and pleased when I hear unsolicited comments about how nice I smell from service providers (docs, nurses, hair stylist ect.  It must mean that this is a pleasing product. really nice smells Just enjoy the scent.....outdoors this one is very high quality. very luxurious! performance is very good, 6-8 hours longevity with 1-2 foot projection for about 5 hours, then sits close to the skin. the value proposition on this one is VERY GOOD. you definitely get your monies worth. unfortunately, i don’t like the scent profile. it’s a dirty, earthy orange scent. of course, i knew that before i bought it, but the scent is too off-putting to me. but if you like hyper masculine scents like that, jump on this one it’s really good. i would classify this scent as marketed to older, more established gentlemen. My son is really happy to have it! It's a powerful perfume any day. Purchased Feb '21 with a coupon making the price quite attractive. I intended to hold the unopened package while I worked through some other colognes. Plans changed after I entered the date code (20872) on before storing the bottle. It proved to be manufactured in 2012. I tried to process a refund, which it seems it not allowed for this type of product. Given a choice between opening it and reselling in the open market, I rolled the dice and popped the cellophane.The fragrance is very clearly genuine and is still fine. All the orange peel, vetiver and Iso E Super cedar notes sit properly in their places. The fragrance is sophisticated, masculine, seeming fairly mature and the woodier notes last on the skin for the whole day. If you know what you're buying when you order, Terre d'Hermes is fantastic. If you haven't smelled it before, it might be worth trying to sample before purchasing.So in the end everything turned out OK, but potential buyers should be aware that (at least in this case), Amazon has shipped unusually old product without any disclaimer in the product information.

Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz,"So to start, the reviews about the leaks/bottle damage are true. however it is not something that should cause you to avoid this item. The sprayer top is made of plastic and i think that it leaks when it heats up and is turned upside down. The bottle damage was only cosmetic, there is black paint on the bottle which soaked up the liquid and then began to peel off. just take a wet paper towel and rub the paint off that is wet. it will only peel the damaged part. other than that it is a great product. To give you an idea of how much i lost due to the leak i would say a little less than a fifth of the bottle leaked... not that much at all you probably will get tired of the smell before you run out of spray.The smell.... it is very masculine. HOWEVER it is almost identical to Ur by Usher. it like they just changed the bottle so don't get both because it will be a waste of money. the only up side to Ur is the bottle is kinda cool... but back to the smell, i dont think you could go wrong with it. i can not speak to the longevity of the scent, it smells pretty strong from the bottle so i would wager that it will be on you for the better part of the day how ever it is something that you could get use to and YOU may no longer smell it but others will be able to.Over all i think it would be a 5 star product but because of the leaking part i gave it four. i would give this as a gift to a friend... hope it helps. Two words: spicy lavender. But a ""manly"" spicy lavender (whatever that means). Also, don't be thrown off by the sticker price. Yes, it's super cheap, but it's some good cheap stuff (that doesn't actually smell cheap). This is like a poor man's Swiss Army Classic or Davidoff Cool Water. But slightly more soapy & powdery-smelling. Wear this for when it's hot outside. No base notes or middle notes or  anything like that though. What you smell after the first spray is what you're going to get for the rest of the day. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you. The scent lasts, maybe, on a good day, 4-6 hours. Take this to the gym. Or the yacht. Whatever. Swiss Guard is sweet and spicy, with strong notes of lavender.  Do not let the lavender notes throw you off, though, it is still a masculine scent that is not overly sweet.  It is a fantastic summer scent!  The best part is that it lasts an extremely long time, it would be a good clubbing scent.  The only downside is that the scent does not develop: it smells virtually the same from the initial spray until it wears off.  I enjoy it a lot and it is a good value for the price Amazon has it for! I actually love this fragrance. its manly like smell comes on as well and it last all day long. I tried this cologne the first day I got it, and I was surprised how long the fragrance lasted . after a shower at the end of a 10 hour day I could still smell a light hint of it. this is good stuff it works well as an everyday fragrance if you feel you like something with a little more volume to it..get this it's turned up a bit. ;)) Recomendable The only ""downside"" is that it is mildly potent (which can be a good thing for many). I started using it for work without telling anyone. A woman noticed when she was very close to me while taking a picture. At another time, when I went past a coworker she noticed it and in both occasions they said it smelled really good. Potency varies with different people but what it doesn't changes is that it is a great scent. Its a nice cologne. Smell sweet but not overpowering. It's not to old and not to young. Masculine. The bottle its a problem. While the cologne is in the box for shipping the hot temperature makes the bottle loose it the cover of the bottle and cause a mess is the box and the cologne too. Fix it its just the bottle. The cologne is fantastic. I love. I have been many colognes. Loved this perfume. It was recommended by a friend of mine and I absolutely thrilled by the fragrance. It is nice, soothing and more importantly it stays for atleast 6-7 hours; good enough for work/school. I would recommend this people who would like to try a good perfume on a budget!!"

Bueno I didn't like it Loveit The scent is light and airy. A few sprays and it last all day. A great scent for the office This Perfume is my favorite but when you open it a month and later and it won't spray it is to late to return this item.  Open it as soon as you get it and not when the first one goes empty.  I guess I'm stuck with it. I had forgot how good this perfume is. Will definitely be buying another one once this one finishes. Good price for the big bottle. Can’t beat that! Its a bigger size bottle than i thought it would be. So thats a plus. I sampled a few guess perfumes at the mall but were over priced. Found them more affordable here on amazon. So far the smell is kinda light musk, amber, with small other hints of fragrance. You dont need to use alot so will last. Its better a few minutes after spraying. Its a nice smelling fragrance. I have different kinds at home. This one would be good for going out, date night or casual wear. Thanks. Trying belle next. I give it 4 stars rating all around."

either aren’t sure you have the right perfume, splash, or whatever the hell else might be in those tiny, yet expensive bottles your missus keeps asking for, or buying. Or, you just are fighting your inner voice saying “don’t buy that woman’s product, she has enough money!”Well, the jokes on you, because; your girlfriend, wife, sister, cousin, aunt, grandma, or whoever else asked for this wants it, and you’re a sucker and are gonna buy it anyway.But…. Yknow what? It doesn’t smell half bad. And that’s a win in of itself.Just buy the damn perfume, be happy she got a gift, will smell better; and move on to being upset at the next gift idea….

For the more sophisticated or alluring kind of personality.  True to the swanky Halston fashion style of the 70's but can also be today's conservative, traditional, or blousey type style. When spraying the perfume, the sprayer gets stuck. This is definitely a back in the day perfume and the smell is fantastic. Great price! I love this I am glad I ordered this.  I have a new alternative scent. Just like I remember the scent.  Brings back fond memories of the 80's Hard to find now, but this was the real deal.  It was a gift and the recipient was very pleased. No, the title I gave doesn't sound very positive, but it truly is meant to if you like either of those scents. And trust me, many of us DO enjoy the smell of rich shaving cream and vanilla. 1-12 was introduced to me thanks to online reviews by folks who like lighter 80's powerhouse scents. I owned Z-14 before, and liked it, but never knew 1-12 existed until doing some research. I blind-bought it off Amazon for about 12 dollars, an absolute STEAL considering the size and quality of this cologne. 1-12 starts off potent and very musky and sweet. Limiting one's spritzes of this (like other 80's scents) is adviseable. But immediately you can detect that the ingredients are varied and deep. There's nothing cheap about this fragrance. I believe it's a modern day hidden gem that has so little following/knowledge of it, that the price is equally low.Anyway, after about 30 minutes it begins to morph into a woodsy, powdery scent, perfect for fall or winter evenings. The sweetness has faded away after an hour, and 1-12 has hunkered down into a long-standing thick, richly lathered shaving cream mixed with light vanilla extract. I feel like I just walked out of a barber shop and really cleaned myself up! This cologne has true longevity and projection, lasting 8+ hours on my skin. It doesn't have a cheap smell to it; on the contrary, it exudes warmth and class. I'd say that may be the best way to describe it: a warm, complex cologne that takes you to a comfortable armchair by a fire with your gal in the 1940's. Guys 25 and over would most appreciate 1-12, as it doesn't have an aquatic flavor to it like so many modern scents do. Manly, suave, lofty and distinguished are the adjectives for this cologne and the gentleman wearing it. So I'd say based on the sheer price of it, it's worth the try. But if you enjoy confident scents (esp. 80's colognes), this one certainly won't disappoint!!"

My bottle was damaged doing delivery but situation was handled appropriately. I have brought this for my husband for years. This fragrance has always been one of my favorites. Now that they're older, I brought more for my boys. I will probably buy again after we are done with our rounds. It definitely attracts the girls. Potent,LONG LASTING on the skin and clothes (you can smell it 24 hours later)Its a very nice smell,bottle is large and should last a LONG TIME (dont go crazy this is POTENT)What I smell is..... Most prominent is ginger and baby powder!

I absolutely love the scent. The bottle is super cute too. The 3.4 oz lasts me about a year-18 months. Came in sealed packaging and box. The crown top is fun to keep and display in your jewelry box! I received lots of complaints on what type of perfume I have on. I tell them the name of princesses from Vera Wang. Soft not a hard perfume to were you gag on the smell of some of those. I loved the original Vera Wang Princess, so though I like this spray, it's not as good as the perfume I had.  It's as good as any other spritz fragrances I have. Bought as gift. They love the elegant debonair fragrance. Smells like a fresh water very nice 👍"

Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces,"Excelente perfume lo recomiendo ! GREAT AS ALWAYS Beautiful Wore this scent for years and always would get compliments. Then it was no where to be found. Oh how happy I am that it is back. Great scent, subtle but just right. This is my favorite sent for years. It’s awesome it was still available. Thanks These folks shipped in a timely manner product was in tact unlike Beauty Encounter Espectacular comprenlo y llego rápido This is my favorite Gucci fragrance. Its one of those fragrances that really depends on your skin chemistry. If it agrees with your skin, you'll end up smelling like a lovely mix of peaches, gardenia, and freesia. If it disagrees with your chemistry, you'll end up smelling like burnt plastic. Fortunately, this one agrees with me and I am so sad its pretty much discontinued, had I known this earlier I would've snatched up a couple of bottles. Until I can find at least one backup, I will continue to use this sparingly. I can't really say whether or not I'd recommend this to anyone because its such a love/hate scent. Its also not very widely available now. Heartbreaking...One tip: I highly suggest putting this one at least an hour or two before you have a function to be at. It's very strong but mellows out and lasts sweetly long.The fragrance is a balance between traditions and 21st century dynamism. It is a scent that gets attention from people. Gorgeous,Sensual,Authentic,Feminine,Sweet, Impressive,Irresistible,Fresh and Warm at the same time.African freesia and peach mingle seductively with coriander,jasmine and the intense carnality of damask rose to amplify but a single message in sub woofer pitch:""I am woman, hear me roar!""The lovely vanilla, the patchouli and the vetiver at the base only serve to mollify it enough to allow men to flirt with you shamelessly.This is not frilly or girly smelling but it is perfect for an assured,grown-up lady sure of her sexuality,yet never vulgar.It is also nice for any Season.The EDT Appropriate for Evening wear. You know a fragrance is great when someone walks past you and catches a whiff and actually turn their head to comment it.Sillage?Magnificent.Longevity?+8 hours on my skin."

First off I would just like to say that I am obsessed with sweet scents, especially cotton candy. I will be comparing this perfume to two other perfumes that I think are this sweetness category.Fantasy by Britney Spears.Sweet like Candy by Ariana Grande.While I would put all 3 of these in the same group they are very different scent wise. Delicious Cotton Candy is more like Sweet Like Candy than Fantasy, but still they are all very different.I guess I will say that out of these three this one smells the most like cotton candy, but it's still not hitting the spot if you know what I mean. I went ahead and tried this because I wanted to spend less money on a sweet perfume. But I am regretting purchasing this. When I smell this it smells almost exactly like a cheap body spray I once tried from Claire's when I was 10. (And this body spray was called cotton candy) I feel like if I didn't have that memory I would like this perfume more but it still wouldn't be my favorite. You get an immediate note of cotton candy for a second when you take a whiff, and then what I can only describe as a ""powdery scent"" remains. This powdery scent is what takes me back to the body spray made for children.The scent lingers for a long time but it isn't strong like I like mine to be. I think someone would have to be in your personal space to smell it. If that's what you go for it's great, this is all just opinion and preferences here. I don't want someone to smell me from across a room, but I like it when someone can get a non overpowering scent from a few feet away.Right now, after a spray on each wrist, I have my hands in my lap and I cant smell it unless I bring it up to my face.Here is some advice that might be helpful if you are that person who wants to smell like candy land or something in between. If you want to smell exactly like cotton candy I will just say I have never found that in a perfume. I have found it in candles but never a spray.Fantasy by Britney spears is a VERY strong perfume. You will be getting people's attention with more than two sprays of it. It's not close to cotton candy at all, but it's a spicy sweet. More sweet than spicy. When i say sweet it's like straight up brown sugar. I personally enjoy it me being a sweet freak, but it's not my number one.Sweet like candy by Ariana Grande is my all time favorite even after trying this. It's got cotton candy in there for sure, but it's more mature than this one by Gale. It's not overpowering and I by far got the most compliments on it. Sweet like candy gave me the most compliments from men and older women. I've always felt a feeling of ""this is what I want to smell like always"" with sweet like candy. Its mostly like lollipop cotton candy, with the tiniest hint of fresh. It's not overpowering.Delicious Cotton Candy by Gale, would be my least favorite of the 3. But I would still wear it occasionally. It definitely feels to be for a younger person although the bottle looks to be for someone more mature. There is very little scent throw but the scent lasts all day.I like the packaging for the most part. It seems like contradictory packaging. The outer box is holographic, very pretty and young. And the bottle shape is very unique but I guess the cap says mature to me. I mean, it's a cougar. I honestly thought the bottle was the shape of an actual heart (I couldn't see the photo up close) but I like this better. The cap looks like frosted glass but it's actually plastic. And the cap does not hold itself in place. If you turn it upside down it will fall off and it doesn't keep itself lined up with the shape of the bottle. It's just a loose cap.  The bottle itself is awkward to hold and spray. You have to resituate your hand to spray in the right direction a lot.This was super cheap in terms of perfume. So i wasn't expecting it to be highest of quality. For the price it's actually really good. I guess my taste is just a bit more pricey. I was really just looking for a spray that was exactly like cotton candy and it doesn't deliver on that to me. I can see how some people really love this perfume though. I would still wear it.If I was going to give this to anyone as a gift, it would only be to a teenager. I showed this to my grandmother and she absolutely loved the bottle but she couldn't stand the scent. Not because it was sweet, she said the after notes were very odd. I agree.Take with this what you will, just trying to be helpful. Sometimes a scent will grow on you or you will get to a point you cant stand it. I will update if my opinion changes. I wouldn't purchase it again. I'm gonna stick with sweet like candy. This was a Christmas gift for a very special friend of mine and I received it before Christmas and she was very happy.. I will purchase from this seller again, and thanks for making my Friends Christmas.. I still think the body mist/spray is stronger than this one. Been on the lookout for a good Pink Sugar replacement.  Back when it was Aquolina, the scent was strong and delicious.  But this new Pink Sugar is not the same.  (The Aquolina version had a 🌶️ logo. ) This product however, is much closer to the original.  Very sweet, powdery/marshmallow-cotton candy scent.  The only drawback is the longevity.  If you want proper stripper scent, you're going to burn through it.  So far though, it's the closest substitute I've found.  Give it a shot! Para uso personal This is the weirdest perfume, while it mainly smells like cotton candy which I love!!! But it also has a skunk undertone to it... if I smell it from the bottle it smells just like skunk... when I spray it on me it smells like cotton candy but after you smell the cotton candy a skunk scent follows... like an after smell.... This is my favorite cotton candy perfumes! Only reason why I didn’t give it all 5 stars is because the nozzle on this bottle does not spray correctly. It comes out in a stream! I threw away my old bottle before I open the new or I would of traded nozzles! So this on is a challenge to spray without getting it all over your clothes, face, floor, etc…… lol The bottle is beautiful, and the scent lasts awhile."

She'll be 80 this year and was so thrilled when I gave her this bottle that she put it on right then. The scent was exactly the same as it was some 40 years ago.I was a little put off by the price for a perfume that has been around for so long, but the bottle was a nice large size and her reaction  was priceless.

Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces,"Ellen Tracy is one of my favorite scents of all time. I like the fact that it isn't a super flowery sweet perfume. Everything about it is very subtle yet intriguing.  If you haven't tried it you're missing out. Loved it and loved the price I have not opened this bottle; although I might for my husband's and my 52nd  Anniversary coming up this month.  Of all the perfumes and scents I had ever come across in my long lifetime, now, this one is absolutely , the very, very best!  I had not had any nice perfume in many years; so I had wanted to treat myself.  Glad I did as I'll be looking forward to a special evening using it. LOVELOVELOVE this elegant, classy, feminine perfume! Have been buying this for 20 years now and hope it’s never discontinued.Doesn’t last quite as long as I’d like, but that’s because it IS Eau De Parfumerie, NOT Parfum, still, this fragrance warms nicely fades somewhat languidly ( too quickly for me though) and lingers lightly for quite a while like a vivid memory... it behaves quite like a lady should, I should think! I am so pleased!!!!! I have been looking for this very item with the same scent it had from the past. I am so happy. I will order more and more I also will give as gifts to my friends they would always ask what is that scent you are wearing? Thank you!! :) Noone paid or promised me anything for this review. I really like the scent. However, it does not last long at all. I find my self using 2-3 times per day. So, in my opinion, although inexpensive, if it does not last at least a few hours, it's not worth any money. I love this Parfum Spray and have used it for a long time and get many compliments when I wear it.I hope I can always find it in the future. I like me this fragrance and it isn’t always easy to find"

I am so so so delighted to find a perfume that doesn’t give me a headache! I do reapply it mid-day since it fades somewhat. Really happy with this purchase. The original LaVanilla was once my daily wear. It came in a fuschia pink and brown box. I haven't been able to find it since about 2010. This is certainly the same base, but with a hint of amber or musk. So at first it smells a little too ""mature,"" but thankfully the musk scent goes away after a couple hours and leaves only the vanilla. I first got this scent from a Scentbird subscription because I was looking for a “pure vanilla” to mix with other scents. While I was initially disappointed that this was not the sweet cupcakey vanilla most “vanilla” perfumes are, but this was such a unique scent I decided to give it a try. The first few seconds this smell can come off a bit strong and “o l d lady” BUT once it settles into your skin it is soooooo pretty and warm and amazing. It’s definitely unique. I love this scent sooooo much. My kids also love it! My new signature scent for sure! My only complaint is I feel like it doesn’t last very long in comparison to the scentbird sample I received…. I ran out of the sample and ordered from Amazon to be sure I got a new bottle ASAP.  So not sure if I will continue ordering from Amazon. May try the mfg website to ensure authenticity/quality. ...it's BETTER!  I just got this and cracked it open immediately, could not wait.  I wanna preface by saying I've been looking for a light, non-edible vanilla that's got some ""clean"" notes mixed in.  I've been all about vanilla since I can remember; my favorites are super sweet, sensual scents, but being pregnant has made me shy away a bit from more gourmand scents lately.  I just. want. to smell. CLEAN!  and sweet at the same time.  When I read the reviews for this (on here, as well as fragrantica), I wasn't sure exactly what to expect but I had an idea.  I was right and also wrong in my assumptions.  This is BEAUTIFUL, GORGEOUS.  It's got the warmth and comfort and cleanliness of...say, a Donna Karan Cashmere Mist (which I used to LOVE splashing on after a shower before bed when I was gonna do nothing all night) with this layer of smooth, airy vanilla on top--nothing stronger than...gosh, maybe philosophy fresh cream--very light.  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for.  My boyfriend said ""smells nice"" which means it's lovely, haha!  In the time between applying this and writing this now, it's done this mild dry down.  Still clean and soapy, slightly heightened sweetness.  OLD LADY?  I think not.  Despite being a huge collector of high and mid-end fragrances for years, my absolute signature scent is Burberry Brit, been that way since it was released, but this is gonna take its place for the foreseeable future, especially being pregnant and likely once baby is born; this should be a nice, safe scent for him to be around.  When it comes to being giftable, I'd say SURE!  If you know the person well enough to buy them a fragrance, this could be a great option.  Especially if it's someone who enjoys clean, soapy scents but has a feminism about them.  I'd consider this a lovely daytime safe smell to anyone who gets a waft of it as you walk past, but if you wear it for a night out with someone special, they're gonna get a whole layer when they get to smell it on you up close.  It's so much more sophisticated than the title of ""pure vanilla"" would lead you to believe.  Non-offensive, non-intrusive, but very, very THERE.  I plan on letting this wear off through the evening, showering up and reapplying before bed to see how it lasts through the night/on clothing. If you love vanilla perfume, you will love this I promise. I have many niche vanilla perfumes (Kay Ali, Black Opium, Skylar etc) and this not only pairs beautifully with my expensive perfumes but also stands out on its own! I find myself going back to this perfume more than my expensive ones lol. Will definitely always have a bottle of this on hand. Easy touch, great aroma. Not domineering. When the container empties, I’l buy the same. But I still love it Love the scent"

It makes her “HAPPY”… Estuve a punto de no comprarlo por las opiniones negativas pero el olor es delicioso me encanta.Es el mismo aroma de macys The color of the perfume is yellowish. When comparing it to the perfume I already have, it is much darker in color. Additionally, it does not smell like Clinique Happy at all. It smells like rubbing alcohol.

Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Oz.,"Scent and value for money I absolutely love this scent and its a must have  for fall and winter. However, if you've never smelled it I would try to smell it in a store before purchase (you should do that with any fragrance in my opinion ). Anyway, this review if for those skeptical about getting the real deal. I was nervous to purchase online at such a discount because I've doen it in the past for other fragrances and got a fake fragrance. I took a leap of faith here since it was being fulfilled by Amazon and YES IT IS AUTHENTIC! I got the bigger bottle for less money than the little bottle at regular price. Just make sure it says shipped and fulfilled by Amazon and you'll be happy. Use the money you save for new shoes :) the travel lotion and gel soap are not included. This is one of only 3 fragrances I wear all the time because it is elegant, classic and not overpowering. 👍this is smells pretty good ! And it lasts more than two or three days . The best part is that I’ve never think about it’s such cheaper price ! I had already searched a few videos from YouTube then I bought it . This is really worthy to have it . Es una fragancia divina I usually prefer crisp and fresh scents, but this one appealed to me because it is very soft and warm--a perfect perfume for winter.The scent is not too strong but very noticeable. After application I can smell it on myself for the next 6 hours.Top notes have a lot of warm citrus, definately orange-rich. Pepper and violets make up the medium note. The base note is composed of grassy scents, which provide the longevity for the scent.I like this perfume and would recommend to a friend Love the fragrance, just wish it had a bit more staying power."

Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounce,"As with everything in time, things change....This is definitely the REAL DEAL, but they have made the scent more subtle and it is not a intense.I wore this faithfully when it emerged decades ago. This was my ""Sunday's Best"" Cologne for church. Back then I remember the scent being overpowering. One spray under the shirt worked so well and would last 4+ hours. More than one spray and there would be an emerging headache somewhere within the day , due to the scent remaining super strong.This version, Seems allot more subtle. It takes 2 - 3 sprays to achieve the same level of potency as before. Smells good.. gf loves it I was wary of all the other reviews that said this is not the same as the original.  I’m certain that this is the real deal, however it seems not to have the depth, or longevity of the fragrance that I purchased in the 90’s.  Some reviewers attribute this to different countries of production. I really don’t know. I still love the fragrance, and since I live in a warmer climate, and I consider this a winter fragrance, the difference was negligible at best.  I guess the best comparison would be an Eau de toilet vs. an aftershave. It’s a very subtle difference, and I do not mind the difference. This has a very good smell that seems to last It was a gift for myself always dolce! Awesome durabilidad, robustez, excelente inversión"

Long lasting fragrance definitely a good buy I decided to order this perfume for myself after seeing some recommendations for it off of tiktok. I am a huge perfume person, although this is probably one of the more expensive ones I own as I normally settle for cheaper ones I find in a nearby mall that are equally as nice smelling. I will say I’ve gotten some pretty nice perfumes that are the same size as this one if not larger, for much cheaper, but of course, in this case you are also paying for the brand name. The scent is definitely great, and very clean (which is my favorite genre of perfume scent). I will say that this perfume does not last all day, but I was warned about that before purchasing. You could always try layering it with something or applying it more than once, but if you’re just going on a date or a little outing, it’ll last you. I will say if you’re not looking to drop this much money on a one ounce perfume bottle, check out some scents from Rue21. I get a lot of my perfumes from the Rue21 in my mall, and they are normally around $15. They definitely aren’t the same, or nearly as luxurious, but if you’re looking for something more pocket friendly that is similar to the description of this scent, I recommend Bloom Beyond from Rue21. They fall into the same genre of being clean scents. If you’re looking to treat yourself to something nice and name brand though, I’d recommend this perfume. To small not worth it but it still smells really good Smells good Love this ! I wasn't sure if this was the real deal or knock off, but it arrived way earlier than expected in a tester box, not great for gift giving. However, it is indeed versace bottle and scent. Love it! I expect the longevity to be the same as well, but will report back soon. Always buy testers, Just like the real one, just not in a nice box. Best scent ever."

Cologne Spray 1.8 Oz,"I was thrilled to find this fragrance again.  I loved it when I was a child, and when I was in high school and college.  Lilies of the valley have long been my favorite flower, and nothing is more delightful to me than burying my face in a freshly picked bouquet of them.  To me they say fresh, spring, and perfection.  I wish I knew why it was so difficult to find this fragrance.  It disappeared from store shelves years ago, and it took me until December to try Amazon.  Success!  When I opened the box I was hit with with a delightful whiff of fragrance, and the box and packaging smelled enticingly of lily of the valley.  The box is now the only fragrant thing I have ever put in the recycling bin.  I do not like to wear a lot of fragrance, because I have an extremely sensitive nose.  I find a light spray of this just right, and I can simply reapply it when I need to.  I am thrilled that Amazon has made this and other old fragrances available again.  I am not a trendy person, and when I like things, I tend to like them for a long time.  In this case, I will love this and buy it for as long as Amazon carries it.  I am also going to order the Yardley lily of the valley soap.  It sounds like a great combination, and I am curious to see how that performs.  If you loved this fragrance as much as I did and do, buy the Muguets Des Bois, and take a trip back in time and memory.  You will be glad you did.  As with Proust's madeleines, you can have a satisfying remembrance of things past, and maybe some fragrant dreams of a lightly scented and delightful future. Wow, this really does smell like lily of the valley!  Especially when you smell the spray nozzle.  On my wrists, it smells a little more ""cologne""ish than the bottle itself.  I've had it on for about an hour and I still smell it, it hasn't changed much.  Just one spray.  It smells nice, no mistaking what it is-I definitely picture the LOTV flower when smelling this.  I'm not noticing any other notes.  It's a little strong in a ""perfumey"" way at the beginning, but gets better as it dries down.  It almost gave me bit of headache because it's strong.  I'm sensitive to some scents, and this one is not bad, especially for the price.  I've had others that I couldn't tolerate.I'm not sure I will wear it much, but I think it will smell better directly on clothes, towels, or as a room spray.Odd thing-I received it without a product box, wrapped in bubble wrap.  It didn't appear used, but my Coty L'aimant, which is the same exact type of bottle, came in a nice little box. Like many unemployed white-collar professionals, I have a lot more time on my hands these days. I call Mom a couple of times a week because we live 1,000 miles from each other. We often talk about the ""old days"" and the happy times we had -- especially the flowers we grew in our gardens. One of her favorites -- because of the short-lived, intoxicating fragrance -- was lily of the valley. I reminded her she also used to love lily of the valley perfume . . . she said it was nowhere to be found at the typical retail stores. I checked around and she was right (Mom's are always right), although all the clerks fondly remembered it and got a far-away look in their eyes when I asked if they had any in stock.My wife suggested I check online -- and Amazon.com came through in big way with a wide variety from which to choose. I selected Muquet Des Bois by Coty for Women, Colgne Spray as a surprise birthday gift for Mom. It was easy to place the order and it arrived in a few days -- my mom was thrilled -- she even wore it when she went to bed and claims it was the best night's sleep she's experienced in years. Smells just like the Lily of the Valley flowers that grow outside my home.  The reviews on this product are what sold me.  My mother remembers this perfume from the 50's and says it still smells the same.  It's rare that you can find something still unchanged or reformulated these days, so the old saying is true, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  I love how fresh it smells.  It would be great if it lasted longer, but sometimes that's a good thing.  The bottle certainly is a great value, and there's enough to put a bit in a travel spritzer in your purse to freshen it up during the day.  I'm so glad I purchased this. This Cologne spray, has real smell of ""Lilly of the Valley"", the scent is very good. It reminded me my young life, when I used that cologne or perfume with the same scent all the time. The only bad things, it evaporated very soon, it should stay much longer, than it is.It's originaly made in France, and the product was exellent. This Company ""COTY"" is French too, but the cologne made in USA now??.In my opinion, that the cologne made now in USA, makes the big difference.But it much better, than others sell oil under name ""Lilly of the Valley"", which has nothing to do with real scent of ""Lilly of the Valley"". When I opened the box this came in up, the entire thing smelled like Muguet des Bois. I found out this was because the cap had not been secured all the way and was clamped down on the spray mechanism the entire time, dumping out perfume to about a quarter of an inch below the label. It was all stuck in the bubble wrap that was around the bottle and so it didn't leak everywhere, but it was pooled around the bottle.It smells exactly as I remember (like lily of the valley), and is perfect. Only reason it gets a 4 is because I lost a good portion of it to greedy bubble wrap. This perfume definitely smells like lily of the valley; but it's also a tad too sweet-smelling, which gives it a slightly artificial (man-made) scent.  A little goes a long way, therefore careful application must be observed, or the cologne will enter a room before the wearer!  It also seems to have staying power, and will last throughout the day, but might need to be reapplied if going out for the evening after work.  All in all it's a good value for the money, especially if you love the scent of lily of the valley!"

Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 oz,"Got this for my daughter a few years back simply because she likes Betsey Johnson products. Had no clue what it would smell like or if she would like it. She loved it! Seems a little strong initially but that fades fairly quickly and is a subtle scent that lasts forever! Longest lasting cologne I have ever seen! Compared to other Betsey Johnson products, this cologne is very well priced! I love Betsy Johnson products. This one was the cherry on top. It has a beautiful sweet scent to it.  ""Gives you that fresh and clean feel"". So I spent a considerable amount of time trying to find the light body spray of this exact scent that Gordmans used to sell. After Gordman‘s closed I was unable to find his body spray at all however I thought I’d give de perfume a chance I am so glad I did beautiful sent very light last long time and great for the money highly recommend It's so hard to judge perfume, you really need to be able to test it out on your own skin before you know if it's a keeper...  I appreciate a light, pretty scent.  Not too sweet but not too musky.  I'm in Florida and when it's hot (always) you want to keep things light & fresh.The first day I wore this, I got several compliments... which makes you wonder, did I put on too much?  One woman ran after me into Target to tell me I smelled ""wonderful"".  It's a little bit girly, but layered with body lotion it seems to mellow.  It lasts a long time also, rare for a low end perfume.I decided to embrace the girly-pinkness. It's nice to change things up.  The price is amazing too.  I would probably get it again.The bottle is annoying. The pink foo-foo topper just gets in the way.  The nozzle is all one color so it's hard to tell where the hole is.  I lined it up on the first ""B"" so I won't blind myself on hectic mornings... As much as I love fragrance, I can't say that there are many out there that I absolutely love and just have to have. Most of them are too strong and nauseating to me but when I find ""the one"" (usually by smelling it on someone else) I'll make sure I find out what it is even if I have to ask a complete stranger what it is they're wearing. My favorite must-have used to be Bath & Body Works Breathe Romance Amber Myrrh fragrance mist and then, of course, they discontinued it. (Never understand why companies stop making a good thing that's very popular???) So when I got a whiff of this fragrance (one of my friends/co-workers) wears, I just had to know what it was. It's similar to the fragrance I had grown to love and so I just had to make it my new favorite must have. She told me it was Betsey Johnson but I had never heard of the perfume nor had I heard of the designer, Betsey Johnson so I could never remember. It took at least 3 times for her to remind me of the name of this perfume but finally the name stuck with me and I began my search...best price was none other than Amazon and I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the bottle and packaging is...not to mention the wonderful scent! Smell great I've used this perfume for nearly three years and still receive compliments from strangers on a weekly basis. After receiving one of those compliments today, I decided to post about it.I saw a reviewer post that the bottle she received was plastic. I've never received anything but glass from Amazon. I do, however, always order the 3.4 ounce bottle, so perhaps smaller versions are not always glass. The scent is somewhat strong and I always give a spray to my neck, shoulder & a spray to my hair. Though the first 5-10min it is strong, it settles nicely and I receive compliments anywhere from morning to evening. The other day I sprayed before going to the gym (yes, I prefer Betsy Johnson over my BO when exercising) and received a compliment in the Starbucks line after my workout.I am thoroughly satisfied with this fragrance and am sure many bottles have been sold on Amazon as a result of my zeal! :) Loved Betsy Johnson and gifted it for my sister’s Christmas gift. She has always loved this scent and it is exactly as seen. However, the packaging was handled pretty poorly in delivery and smashed up a bit, but she still loved the product itself. Maybe putting it in another box for delivery would create a barrier and the pretty packaging would remain fully intact. Thanks!!"

Bought this one for my son for Christmas.  This will help him smell like a man who is confident in his male pronouns.  Clubman is a great value and always has great manly barbershop scents. Good. It is a normal product; nor exceptional neither bad Special Reserve seems to be the odd duck in Pinaud's line of aftershaves, with it's hard to place complex array of scents. I admit when I opened the bottle I had some ""reserve"" about this one. I'm a big fan of Pinaud's Clubman & Virgin Island Bay Rum but in the bottle this particular scent is actually pretty rank. It doesn't even smell like something you'd put on your body. It smells like you threw your belt into the campfire while opening a container of stale cinnamon. I'm not exaggerating, I almost didn't use this one because of it's scent but today was my day to shave (I skip every other day) and the Special Reserve was sitting on my bathroom sink so I thought why not. I fully intended to ""regift"" this after one use, but no longer. Out of the bottle and on my skin the scent changed immediately into a woodsy-leather-smoky mixture that is very pleasing and as the blurb on the bottle states it is indeed bold & masculine. It soothed my skin very well and tightened it, similar to the effect of Aqua Velva. I didn't nick my face today so I can't say if it stops minor bleeding as well as the Clubman or Bay Rum does. I would describe the three scents this way: Virgin Island Bay Rum is a working class, no nonsense scent. It burns, it's tough, it's what a guy who works in a factory or steel mill would wear. Clubman is old school upper class, something that Jay Gatsby would wear to drink cocktails with attractive young ladies and business associates. Special Reserve strikes me as what the gentleman hunter would wear while discussing his latest adventure in a social club over whiskey and good cigars. Of course these are the images my mind conjures up, and are completely subjective. I always was the Walter Mitty type who felt out of place in my own time.UPDATE: I nicked myself pretty good today and can report that Special Reserve does stop minor bleeding well. Overall I'm liking this one a lot, and the scent seems to last quite a while too. You either love Pinaud or hate it, there is no middle ground it seems.  I've tried the Virgin Island Bay Rum, Classic Clubman, and the Vanilla, and enjoyed them all (especially the Vanilla, that stuff is great).  So I gave this one a try after reading the favorable reviews.  For about $6 a bottle, the risk on investment was small.  Upon opening the plastic bottle and smelling it I feared that this was the first Pinaud that I would regret buying.Then, I decanted about 5 ounces into a glass bottle with shaker top that Amazon sells for those folks who make and bottle their own hot sauce.  These are great for decanting ""drug store"" after shaves out of their plastic bottles to remove that plastic funkiness that all Pinaud's seem to have at first.  A few days later I took the plunge and splashed some Special Reserve on after a shave.  It instantly reminded me of Aramis, only a bit different (much like the Classic reminds me of Brut, only different).  It's strong at first, much like the Classic, so be a bit conservative with your ""splash"".  Leather, tobacco, some other spices which I can't pinpoint, but the overall scent is warm and manly.  It definitely has lasting power, but the scent is clean, masculine, not at all floral or sweet.  I can smell this stuff from the time I splash it on, through the rest of my morning routine, getting dressed, making coffee, and then during my drive to work in the car.  About an hour or so.  Then, it starts to fade, to the point where I no longer perceive it but I get whiffs of it throughout the day.This is a good winter time after shave.  The scent and feel just seem to ""go"" with colder temps as opposed to the menthol after shaves like Floid Blue which are definitely warm weather after shaves.  While there are no obvious moisturizing or healing ingredients that I can see on the label, but my face doesn't feel dried out or overly tight when using this.  I get a kind of matte feeling to my skin which is rather pleasant.  Overall, this has become part of my rotation, especially in the colder weather now.  The Vanilla is still my favorite Pinaud, but this is a close second. I like this stuff..  its a tad bit strong when you first apply it but it wears down to a nice subtle aroma.. A few people notice and comment on how nice it smells... a musky scent with a hint of baby powder...  smells clean.. its good. I really like the original scent so I wanted to try the Special Reserve. So far, I am very happy with it but the reason for 4 stars instead of five is a little complicated.First, I read many reviews of the manly, woodsy, smokey scent and felt that this was what I was looking for. Now, keep in mind that different scents work with different peoples chemistry differently so I didn't know what to expect. When I first opened the bottle, I knew that I was going to like it. And I do! But, perhaps I have been punched in the nose too many times or maybe I have had a stroke that I didn't know about because I find this to be more of a powdery, slightly floral scent when applied to my face. I perceive it as similar in scent as the Pinaud Talcum Powder. Completely opposite of what others have written. Thinking I was perhaps crazy, I conducted a little test and confirmed that I AM crazy.I placed a small dab of the original on one wrist and a small dab of this on the other then asked my wife which she preferred. She very much favored the original but was not put off by the Special Reserve at all. When asked why, she replied that is was a bit too smokey for her taste. WTF? Am I the only nut job in the world that does not smell the wood or the smoke? There might be an underlying and subtle spice scent that seems to come out later, what I think some people call a base note.In any case, I do enjoy the smell and use it every so often but I prefer the original a bit better. As attested to by the varied reviews, people have very different experiences with not only this, but many different scents. For the price, it will not hurt you to try it out."

I lean towards earthy, watery and floral scents in perfumes and colognes. One I loved when I was younger was white musk. I bought this when I was feeling nostalgic, and I'm glad I did. It's the same soft musk I remember; you don't smell like you've bathed in musk. I like to layer this with other colognes. It doesn't work with everything, but a spritz of this with say, a single note floral works wonderfully. I remember wearing this scent when I was younger and loving the musky, vanilla type smell. It smells exactly how I remember, but definitely doesn't last very long. For the price point though, it's worth it! Strong, vintage scent and a little goes a long way. Wear too much and it’s headache inducing for yourself and probably the folks around you. The scent smells clean and it’s nice. I saw this perfume and bought it because it was a staple with the women in my family when I was a kid. The formula does not seem to have changed much the smell is still the same after all these years. I mistakenly ordered this OIL by Jovan thinking it was the spray.  Oil is nice fragrance, my chemistry doesn't permit it to last long however.  Well packaged with fast shipping.  Price is good.  Note, this is a small bottle of oil, not a large one. I have been using it for about 40 years, it's my favorite to wear, always get complements from strangers. Try others but always go back to Jovan Musk It was a great gift my woman loved it The scent seems diluted compared to previous use"

Don’t let the small bottle fool you, if used on your body, one bottle will last you a long time! I put one dab on each arm below my elbow and rub them together and I smell like Nag Champa all day. People often ask me if I burn incense, and I tell them it’s a perfume oil. One thing of note, you don’t want to use too much of this. It may give you headaches like some colognes if used too generously. Also, this product is great for soap making. To make a batch of about 24 bars, you’ll want to use the entire bottle. I usually get my Nag Champa from my little local hippy shop - but they have been out, so I ordered this as a substitute. While it smells great and it’s an oil that lasts longer than regular perfume…. It doesn’t have a roller ball so you end up having to use your finger to apply and I’m not a fan. Additionally- I believe it may need a bit more carrier oil as it does burn a bit when applied and needs to be diluted somewhat to prevent this from happening. This being the reason behind less than 5 stars. I've sniffed a lot of perfume oils trying to find one that actually smells like real Nag Champa, and this is about the closest I've found. It is EXTREMELY strong. When I first got it, I dabbed a little on my finger and rubbed it behind my ears and on my wrists. 20 minutes later I had to go take a shower because the scent was so strong it was giving me a headache. I've found that if I mix water, grapeseed oil, and just 2 drops of the perfume oil in a small atomizer, it's just right. You still don't need much--do a mist and walk through sort of deal. The scent actually lasts for quite awhile, but certainly not all day. Beautiful. I wore it to PT (physical therapy) the other day and when my therapist hugged me she exclaimed, ""You smell like my incense!"" So it's definitely identifiable as the Nag Champa incense we all know and love.Two things of note: 1. If I were you, and I discovered this last week in PT, I wouldn't put it anywhere where your skin folds--for instance, on the inside of your elbow--if you're going to be exercising or getting sweaty; it can be a little irritating to the skin. 2. If you want to enjoy the scent during the day but find the oil straight out of the bottle a little strong for daytime wear, just mix a drop with a bit of unscented hand cream or lotion and it'll settle down to a subtler but still noticeable version.In any event, I'm so glad I took a chance, because it really is the *real deal,* that lovely, spiritual scent of Nag Champa. I've had some bad luck with perfume oils on amazon, so it was a happy surprise to finally find a good one. I hadn't burned Nag Champa incense since my late teenage days and after smelling it in a shop I realized I was longing for that smell that brought me back to my youth. Then I found out there was an oil that smelled exactly like it! I can't tell you how in love I am with this oil! Even my husband won't stay away because he thinks it is the best thing ever. It is very strong so you only need a small dab and it will last a long time. But if you're looking for Nag Champa smell, this is THE ONE! My favorite way to use it is to run the bristles of my hair brush across the top of the bottle and then brush my hair with it. It puts the most subtle scent into your hair and then I also use a light dab in each armpit before applying my deodorant. As soon as you start to sweat it just smells amazing. That's right, I said it smells amazing when I sweat! This oil is seriously heaven. I plan on adding a drop to some of my homemade body products and just feel like there's an list possibilities. I love wearing this scent. It smells as good as the incense and I don’t feel it’s overpowering at all. I’ve gotten many compliments when I’m wearing it. Most perfumes make my skin break out and this oil never causes a reaction. I have tried a few other Nag Champa perfumes and Triloka brand is the best smelling and longest lasting.  That being said, their quality control rates as very poor.  The tiny bottle only holds one dram.  That equates to .0625 ounces.  When you pay this much for a little tiny bottle it had better be full.  At least half of all the bottles I have ever purchased have been less than full, to one degree or another.  Some of them have even arrived with the cap loosely on the bottle and the perfume leaking out. Extremely concentrated perfume oil: dilute with a neutral base oil! Or add to scented baby oil / mix with woodsy scents / body spray.T he scent is nice, dense and strong, almost 'primal' - not for everyone and perhaps not a particularly work-friendly scent. When properly applied though, it's extremely appealing. Comforting, vannilic and 'warm' smelling.There also seems to be quite a bit of patchouli involved. To me it's not really an exact Nag Champa perfume, but it does invoke these distinct incense / India / hippy / headshop associations.People will definitely notice you and comment (""ow you smell like incense!"" - meant in a good or bad way :p)"

It was too strong for me. Had to give it away. I had worn the same cologne for years and was very disappointed when the maker decided to no longer carry it. I tried several other perfumes/colognes over the last couple of years, even pricey ones, and though I liked a few, nothing clicked.  I remembered how much I loved Alfred Sung back in the day. So I decided to check it out again and realized he had several available. Jewel has become my new favorite, my new signature cologne. Alfred Sung - I thought I didn't like this one, but I have changed my mind. Yes, it is trendy,  a bit loud, but there is personality under all the noise.  Don't spray on too much, just a bit;  let it sit for awhile, and this one cleans up quite well.  Really a beautiful scent under all the initial noise. Made me itch! Loved it This perfume can be used daily.  I would probably recommend it more for daytime use since the fragrance is more ""light and airy"" like a early summer day :)"
