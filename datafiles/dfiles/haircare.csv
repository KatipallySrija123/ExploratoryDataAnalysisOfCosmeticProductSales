The golden oil is an incredibly rich source of vitamin E; in fact it contains twice as much as olive oil. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant which keeps the skin smooth and youthful while reducing any aging inflammation. Argan oil also contains saponins, which soften the skin and promote elasticity. They are also thought to help to reduce wrinkles by restoring the skin's water lipid layer and to cool and soothe.

Argan oil is also a potent source of essential fatty acids, especially the vital linoleic acid which cannot be made by the body and must therefore be obtained in nature. These essential fats have been shown to prevent dry, aging skin while rejuvenating the protective connective tissue and healthy skin cells.

Argan oil also contains rare plant sterols not found in other oils, making this one of nature's truly special oils. These plant nutrients make this super food for the skin and body. Its versatility soothes and smoothes all parts of the body including face, body, hands, nails, scalp and hair.

Because this oil is completely natural and chemical free, it is fantastic for problematic skin conditions such as rosacea, eczema, and psoriasis. The high vitamin E content make it useful for scarring and the combined power of this oil make it extremely beneficial for people with dehydrated, damaged from overexposure to the sun or toxins. It also helps prevent stretch marks.The golden oil is an incredibly rich source of vitamin E; in fact it contains twice as much as olive…
