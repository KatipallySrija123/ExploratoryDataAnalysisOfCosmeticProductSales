granted first put look like trying zombie makeup blending get nice contoured appearance key using product especially fair use small amount apply judiciously apply much no amount blending going stop looking grungy one product seen purpose matte finish great contouring,theBalm Bahama Mama Bronzer,"Small with a sleeve for product. Helps it from gelling crusted in the make up case. Great travel size. I absolutely love this bronzer. I have had the hardest time finding one that doesn’t leave me with an “oompa loompa” glow. I don’t look orange, it works well for contour as well and I even use it as eyeshadow. I will be purchasing the full size of the product! This is the perfect bronzer not to much shimmer compliments my skin , beautiful pigment and it doesn't take much to apply. This bronzer is great for the price. The size is perfect for traveling. Color pigmentation is on point for the value! Best bronzer ever for contouring and a natural tanned look. Been using this brand for over 10 years. Looks like dirty muddy ashy brown on my skin. Needs a touch of a copper or orangey glow in there. This is a perfect bronzer if you are Olive toned. It has no orange or red undertones and just a nice warmed tan look. I have been searching and returning so many bronzers. I bought the Oliver by the balm first bc it said it had no orange/red but it had a lot of unwanted warmth. Tried this next and i love it! I didn’t realize how the majority run really orange/red. This isn’t a super dark bronzer, but i think you can build up a little bit. I purchased Bahama Mama bronzer from The Balm thinking it was one of the darker bronzers.  I don't think it is.  On my skin, Bahama Mama bronzer is very similar to Chocolate Soleil (from Too Faced).  The Bahama Mama looks darker in the pan, but on my skin they're very similar.  I like them both.  Chocolate Soleil is ever so slightly pinker if used heavily.  And the  Bahama Mama develops a sheen if used heavily over cream or liquid foundation - something that doesn't happen with Chocolate Soleil.  Its not a problem.  I don't have a heavy hand with bronzer.  I use them interchangeably.  Neither one changes color.  Neither one breaks me out.  The biggest difference is - Bahama Mama doesn't smell like chocolate.I've tried Benefit Hoola but that one is lighter and doesn't show up on me.",5,3,2

easily love,"NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Doll Eye Mascara, Volume, Black","This mascara was bought as a substitute for uber expensive Fiberwig mascara that I had heard and seen great things about.  I also needed something that would ship quick since the event I wanted to do this gyaru look for would be in a week.  Shipping was great by the way, bought it using Amazon Prime and it arrived just in time as promised.Anyway about the mascara, it is really dark, surprisingly dark, especially since I have black lashes to begin with and I had no idea they could actually get darker :p so if you want that in a mascara this has it.What I was really looking for was length though and it did okay.  It wasn't nearly as dramatic as I've seen with the Fiberwig (though I've never tried it myself) but I didn't have the highest expectations so it made for a good start.  Lengthening was really good actually, not as good as I wanted for the look but as good or even better maybe than I had expected.Another important factor to me was to be clump free and this mascara also did well.  It's not the clump-free-est I've ever had (Maybelline's Great Lash is) but it does decently, especially after I run that electric curler through it then it looks really nice.  I also attempted to separate up my lashes with a lash comb but the mascara flaked off :( which really bothered me, I'm glad I didn't have the full face on trying it for the first time since messing with it made it flake quite a lot.  But um, yeah, don't do that and  you'll be good.Overall I actually quite liked it, flaking is the only issue I had and in all other aspects that I've considered it does pretty well and looks especially nice when curled.  It did better than expected and was well worth the price I think, especially with the free two day shipping.  I would indeed recommend this product. I bought this black waterproof version of the formula hoping for the exact thing I lost many years ago when they discontinued Lash Stylist, it might be even better than the one I used before!My eyes don't feel itchy, and my eyelashes have flexibility vs feeling crispy.  I tried this without the use of a eyelash curler to see what kind of lift I could really get and wow.... I just bought two more bottles of this stuff that's how pleased I am!If they offered a comb applicator version of this I would be in heaven.  Still, it works wonders for me, and that is saying a lot since my eyelashes don't like to do much, and now I can hold them upright all day.  I didn't notice any flaking either so that is a huge bonus.I actually ended up sending a link to a friend who also loved and used Lash stylist from way before.  When you're recommending to friends you know its good.  <3I'm trying to understand why this product has some bad reviews, because I honestly can't find any fault with it.  Maybe they tried a different version from me?  Who knows.  I'm pretty ecstatic with my purchase. I read a review (not on Amazon) of this mascara.  Sounded good, so I checked to see if Amazon carries it.  They do, and I decided to try it.  I needed a new mascara, anyway.When I shop for mascara, I check out price, product, performance, and packaging.  I want a product that works well, costs little, and is packaged in a manner suitable for use and preserving the product.  I prefer non-waterproof mascaras, and I like lots of length and volume.  In other words, I'm demanding, and not so easy to please.When I received this, I thought at first I'd received old product because it is SO THICK, it appeared to be dry.  Usually when you open a new mascara, you'll see a bit at the end of the brush you need to wipe off before you start applying it.  No, that wasn't there.  I started putting it on anyway, and SHAZAM!  It does add incredible volume and length, plus, if you twist the wand upward and outward, it adds great curl.  At first I thought, oh, I have too much of this on, but the curl softens a bit.As far as volume goes, you can get it with Cover Girl Lash Blast in the orange tube, or the L'Oreal or Maybelline volumizing mascaras.  They're very good.  But THIS one gets the lower lashes, too, without clumping.This mascara does not flake or smudge.  Even when my eyes are watery from allergies, my mascara stays perfect all day long.  It will clump if you dawdle when you apply it.  Just go at it with confidence.  You can speedily add layers while simultaneously brushing out any clumps.I'm ordering this, or the lengthening version, again.  I haven't tried the lengthening version yet.  This is a great mascara.  It exceeded my expectations.  The only caveat I offer is that because it is so thick, it does take me a little extra time to remove it.  I dab on some",2,5,-3

Kiss proof, fabulous. Or you can leave it Matte for a more Maybeline Superstay Matte Ink look-- though slightly more natural and less powdery than that fabulous lipstick.Note: There is not a ton of product in the Revlon color stay, but it is enough that you can use it while it is still fresh and treat yourself to another-- especially if its still under $10.Versatile. And the Endless Spice option is a great natural tone for anyone with pale to medium caucasian coloring and lips that are naturally medium-high pigmented (not pale lips, it would be a touch more dramatic if you have pale lips), if you have darker skin the lipstick will probably read lighter, and if you have naturally pale lips it may pop a bit. It is a rose with pink/brown undertones. I would love to see it on different skin tones but so far have only seen it on mine-- I suspect though that this may be a bit like that magic cranberry color that looks good on most skin tones. Anyway on me it's a neutral with some umph and a feminine flair I love! Enjoy y'all! I am in love with this color.  I've tried at least 2 dozen colors of other brands in search of the perfect pinkish/red  color for a natural look.  Other brand colors were too nude or too bright.  This color is muted perfectly for a natural look.  If you're looking for a natural beautiful color for yourself like I was, search no more!It is smudge proof, quickly dries, can wear matte or glossed -both are a gorgeous look, and the duration for color stay is unbelievable.  I've drank coffee, ate meals throughout the day, sipped cocktails, and the color hardly fades by end of day..  I understand why this is sold in multi packs, which I'll be purchasing next time.My only complaint is there seems to be more gloss than color, and it doesn't seem like a lot.  On the other hand, you only need to apply once a day so I'm good with it.  Ladies, don't hesitate to buy, you won't be disappointed! This is the best lipstick ever. It last until you literally take it off with makeup remover love this have been wearing it for about 15 years I like this stay-on lipstick a lot because it gives good coverage and can serve as an all-day base goat for lip gloss if you want more color or variety than the clear gloss of the product. It;s long lasting without feathering. Just need to apply a gloss throughout the day to keep your lips moisturized. Highly recommend this product! Before kind of full inside this kind of lipstick, but this time small amount, has enough the clear liquid, but the lipstick color is a little As advertised. This produce does stay on your lips for many hours a day/night. Many women today have their lips tattooed for lasting color.  Well tattooing does not last forever on the lips and the color fades.  However, do not despair, this lip color last way longer than 16 hours.  I have put it on in the morning and still have plenty of color the next evening.  Also you can pick from many colors not just one (if you have tattooed your lips).  Love it, but it is hard to find, so get it here.",2,3,-1

Wears off with a remaining tint and a few shimmering specks. Very pretty. Will buy more Love this gloss! It has a very high gloss and the perfect amount of color This color is a lot different than expected! At first I thought it would be too pale on me and not match with my skin. I have warm undertones and I've a light brown skin tone w/ a brown upper and pink lower lip. Last thing I wanted was to look washed out!! Rest assured, this color is BEAUTIFUL and unique. Absolutely I love it. Great nude lip when you're trying to keep it simple. The texture is VERY slightly sticky but not enough for me to be turned off, and it is buildable. Staying power lasted (for me) about 5 hours. So you may need to reapply it but seriously psssh who cares?! This is now a favorite so I don't mind! The color is so different from any other lip colors I've come across and can be worn casually or with a bold look. I discovered it when I was looking at a Sophia Loren article about diamond face shapes (which I have) and what lip colors go look best with it. I felt like a model when I put this on, that's how much I loved it because it does enhances my features. Surely anybody with any face shape can wear this, however! If you're on the fence about the paleness, I'd say not to worry, and try it! I still have this lipgloss. It is not long-lasting but I still use it once in a while as I hate matte lips, love to put gloss on. Sticky tho, smells nice, I never noticed a 'flavor'. Revlon makes some fo the best lip products on the market. Recommend. Favorite lipgloss for yearsssssss I love the color for this lip gloss however it's not for me. I suffer from chronic chapped lips and I still haven't found a product that works well enough. Because my lips are often chapped, when I apply this lip gloss it looks cakey and gross. I started using Mac lip primer first and that does help. My second issue is the color vs. the color of my skin tone. When I wear the lip gloss it just looks like a clear gloss because my skin is pretty pale. I thought it would still have a bit of a tint to it but it doesn't. I sometimes pair the lip gloss with Revlon's soft nude lipstick, but it looks better without the lipstick to be honest. I still gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the problems I have are specific to me. If you have tan skin and you don't suffer from chapped lips all the time like I do, I think you would enjoy this lip gloss. So this was a great price, the color is nice I would recommend for some one with light to medium skin. This is a neat color to build with and apply over your lipstick our your lip stain. You could have fun with this one, or just use it on it's own since it is sheer enough. The reason I am only giving it two stars is because the safety seal was clearly broken when I received it. I just noticed that someone else made the same kind of statement in a review before. I know this product comes with this seal over it, and when I received it. I noticed it looked like someone just pulled at it but when i looked further I noticed that then seal was completely broken. Oh well not sure if that is why the price is so cheap. Also would like to add that the seller contacted me and issued a refund to me since the seal was broken. Very much appreciated. I have a golden brown skin tone (like cinnamon or brown sugar) and this pink tinted orange is perfect against my skin. Also, my cousin tried it on today and her skin tone is a richer brown almost like chocolate and it looked good on her as well. You can play up the sunny orange with bronzer or gold makeup and accessories or play up the pink accents with soft blush. It has a pretty good lasting power, even when I eat (as long as I eat carefully). Its creamy and has a good layer power as well. It doesn't plump and it doesn't leave a stain. I sort of wish it had a tiny bit of plumping power to make the lips look juicier and more even and fill in the gaps but eh, not really necessary. Another drawback, if layered too much it gets sticky and mixes with saliva and...it just gets kinda gross. It doesn't have any particular smell that I can detect. So overall I would recommend this gloss.",3,5,-2

bought one several years ago and I was looking for a replacement, same color, and was glad I found it.  The texture is just soft enough that it draws lines easily, but doesn't break off.  Obviously my previous brow pencil lasted several years and it still worked as well as when it was new.  This one is definitely worth the money. This pencil was everything it said it would be. I love how slim it is and the very fine lines it creates just like a natural brow. The color choice I chose was ash because I have gray in my hair and it just works perfectly for me. The brow pencil keeps its true color. It goes on easy. It stays for several hours on oily skin. It does tend to spread by the end of the day or in hot humid weather. Have not been able to create fine lines with the tip. This is the best eyebrow pencil I have ever used. It’s my second time purchasing. It’s very easy to use and I’m so happy I purchased it. My eyebrows are pretty light so the soft brown goes very good with my eyebrow color. I love this pencil . Such great quality and gives a natural effect. As an older woman, my eye brows are fading. This pencil is perfect for me. My hair is colored and pencil matches my hair coloring. It all looks very natural. The only thing I dislike is I don’t get any type of warning when it’s about to run out. I usually handle this by having a spare. Don’t want to run out. Product is perfect color for my brows (taupe), goes on easily and lasts a long time. It’s my second time buying this product. I definitely love it! I recommend it for sure.",3,5,-2

Last minute pick for Halloween bash for work. Took a lot of applying to get that white I was looking for, but overall it worked wonders. Smooth & creamy. After it dries it doesn’t smudge much. A great find. Just wasn't right for me. It was the right shade but just didn't look right on....I'm a pure liquid or powder foundation kinda chick...maybe I wasn't doing it correctly? Maybe I'll buy again sometime and try again...? I used this for my joker cosplay. It went on easily with minimal smearing without setting spray. But using makeup remover, soap and water was still very difficult to remove it took a few washes to fully get off. This didn’t feel like costume makeup. It went on like foundation and stayed on all day. It didn’t rub off on everything either. Although the price is a bit too much for a small product like this, It doesn’t feel heavy, easy to spread and blend! I’m a darker tone compared to this so it really popped off the quick goth look I tried to do once I got off work. I’m using this for my Halloween costume this year so I am quite excited to do my makeup with this. I bought this product because I am into the goth look and wanted that gorgeous dramatic look. Unfortunately I was less than enthused with my product. When it arrived and after I opened the package there were beads of liquid on the top of makeup. This did not put me off at first because this can happen if makeup, especially creams, are being transported in changing temperature. The package is also very very small for the price. I applied my toner and my base before applying the white foundation. It didnt look bad, but I had to put on a pound of setter just to make it look good. It was very greasy upon application, and I had to fight to blend it with my blender sponge. When the cream did dry is was not ""velvet"" but powdery and was not laying on my skin in a lovely porcelain but looked like the cheap white makeup you get from a Halloween store where its practically see through even if you put a pound of it on. Sure, it makes you look white, and looks good from afar, but get anyone close up and you look like you put dandruff all over your face. I tend to be on the dryer side of skin types, but I moisturize and have a good routine of skin care.TLDR:Cons: I, am fairly pale already but even I needed to do four passes to get that great Goth white. And even then it sat on my face like cheap horrible clown makeup. I have to use too much of the product to get the desired look. Its greasy upon application and does not dry ""matte"" in the traditional sense, very clingy/flakey looking. Does not set even after applying a ton of setting power, smears for days. Has a green undertone somehow.Pros: You can take nice pictures and look fairly decent, but I would not go out with this look. Marilyn Manson has a better Goth look.My skin type just might not be compatible with this particular brand, and if it works for you thats great! However, if you are on the dry skin side, maybe find a liquid white foundation and go with that as I know I have good luck with them. goes on light, use a sponge and you can make it as thick or light as you want, always a smooth clean look.",5,5,0

I was hoping this would look a bit less matte on my skin.  The loose base looks darker on me.  I'm going to try to return. One staple in my daily routine! East to apply, smooth finish with flawless outcome. Finally!  found a quality powder which goes on evenly!  I use the golden dark on my olive skin during the summer months.(Be sure to use a good brush for application ☺️)You can use for light coverage or add more as needed.  I will try the bronzer next.  Recommend!! glo-minerals loose powder is the best thing I've found to act as my foundation.  It can be sheer or buildable, depending on the coverage you need. I will sometimes wear it over a tinted moisturizer, but I usually apply it over a primer, and that's all I need. The key is to find the right color, and that may take some experimentation.  I've tried both Golden Dark and Honey Light, which are very similar in color.  For my Caucasian lightly-tanned skin (yellow undertones), Golden Dark is right for me.  In the winter when my tan has faded, I move to Golden Medium. I've tried Bare Minerals, and its fine, but I like this better.  Applied correctly, it will cover as well as MAC, but it is less cakey and more natural-looking. I only wear higher-end makeup, and my goal is to look polished but not ""made up.""  This fits my goals, does not irritate my skin, does not make me break out, and as an added bonus, provides some sun protection. Good coverage and quality. Does not gather  in creases and lines. Premium product.Prefer the pressed powder base but it was out of stock. i ordered a shade way too lite for me and now im stuck with it Product was high quality I tried this make up at Beauty Brands originally.  The assistant helping me applied to part of my face.  When I got home, that spot had much better coverage than my otc makeup.  I like a powder as it is easier to apply without creating a line where I stop.  The coverage is great for my fair skin where I often have redness show through.  I often sleep in my make up, I know this is not reccomended but I do.  And it still gives some coverage the next day until I wash and reapply.  Also wears well with allergy eyes and crying.  I love this make up.",1,5,-4

sties and that hurts a lot and makes me quite sad. But I still want to have that cute mascara look where my eyelashes are a little curled. This does the job and I put the date of when I have to trash this mascara on the bottle with blue tape and permanent marker so I don't forget. It's easy to remove and keeps my lashes the curl that the eyelash curler gives me. I do eyelash curler first and then very lightly, this mascara. I don't put on a lot because I don't think I need too and it still holds my lashes in place. I also don't touch the root of my eyelashes with the wand because that's how eye infections start. It's like instead of using gel to hold hair down, I'm using mousse, but for my eyelashes. It works and is good enough for me, who tends towards a more natural look. I was very surprised when this was delivered. The mascara container was covered with mascara. I looked in the package and there was nothing in it to show it had leaked out. So it looks like it was packed this way. I had never had anything like this happen. I do like this mascara tho. This is the ONLY mascara that actually makes my eyelashes stay up and look full! Every mascara I’ve ever used makes my eyelashes fall down. I have extremely straight lashes so I have to use a heater curled and even doing that my lashes fall down with every mascara. This mascara keeps mine up all day and it’s surprisingly easy to remove. I am 60 and have thinning lashes.  I used Maybelline in the pink and green tube for almost 40 years, and I realized it didn't work for me like it used to.  I've used Lancome, Estee Lauder, Thrive, I can't name them all.  This Full N Soft has worked wonderfully for me, and I can tell a big difference in the look of fullness and length of my lashes.  Highly recommend this mascara. It doesn't make your lashes super hard, they stay softer and more natural looking but still look long and dark so it still makes a difference. Tho even the water proof one doesn't wipe off easy and leaves black residue. Had to scrub my eye until it was really irritated to get it off Love this mascara. You can put on as little as you want or build it up. I wear it everyday. It's not a thick mascara which is perfect for me. Easily washes off. No complaints I will continue to purchase. I like my natural eyelashes enhanced and not to smudge.  Very hard. Everything smudges. Even waterproof a little.  This does the best job over anything else I’ve tried Been using this for years. Leaves my lashes soft. Stays on all day",1,3,-2

It’s been available for years. So when I do find it in the drug store or Walmart, I buy one or two even if I don’t need it at the moment. It’s a great rosy warm color with a bit of shine. But barely. I’m well over 50, so i wouldn’t want something in makeup that is too shiny or gleamy looking. I get compliments on this shade. And I had to buy it this time on Amazon bc I couldn’t find it in the store. Love it. Use it daily day or night. I bought this because I heard it was a dupe for a higher end brand. Even though it is bright pink, the color is somehow magically flattering on everyone who wears it! I love it! I have stocked up on it! I like this brand of blush and this type, but it's hard to judge the colors online.  I didn't see the color I've bought before, so chose a similar name.  Good price, not exactly the color I wanted, but it will do. It’s last a good amount of the day and is very pigmented. Even when applied lightly like in the picture you can still see that blush. I use it as a eyeshadow and blush bc it’s rlly flattering on my skin tone. Recommended for deep winters as it’s a purple plum shade. I have been searching for this colore for a long time. Don't be decieved that it may look too dark.  It is just the right color and sheerness for someone with olive tone skin. It's darker than I expected, but I'm going to keep it and use it as an eyeshadow. Nice easy blush that doesn’t bother my sensitive skin. Skimpy amount compared to previous recent orders! I love this color and stores don't carry it anymore.  So happy I can still find it.",5,1,4

Perfector,"So I wanted to write a review for this product the day after I used it, but I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't have been able to learn about it's full ability to protect and keep my skin looking smooth. When I first used it, I thought that the texture of the ""liquid"" or ""cream"" was very odd... This product is not wet like the primer I'm used to, which is Urban Decay's Complexion Primer. When you roll it around in your fingers it get powdery and it disappears into a slick film on your fingers. I suppose this is the ""MAGIC"" in the ""MagiX"" part of this product. At first, I doubted it's ability to really glide on my skin, so I used A LOT the first time. TOTAL mistake. I must note that the first time you open it, there is a bunch of oil that collects at the bottom of the tube. I almost believed that that was the primer! OIL? I was horrified. Dispose and dismiss this substance. I mixed in this oil with my first application. I broke out on parts of my face that isn't the NORMAL part I would breakout. I almost gave up on it, but I am extremely picky about wasting money. So I used it again the next time. This time, I used a little less. It worked wonderfully! However, the true extent of it's effectiveness can be tested in harsher conditions. I am an Import Model and yesterday I had to work at a car show. I was walking around outdoors all day. The beaming sun can make someone quite uncomfortable, as I had to worry about the amount of sweat dripping on my face. Throughout the entire day my liquid foundation (I use MAC Liquid Fix) stayed on and the only ""touch-ups"" were to add powder my nose. I must say, however, that it didn't stay as smooth on my face near the end of my 8-hour day as my more pricey Urban Decay brand, but it held up to my expectations for most of the day. I'm really glad I bought the primer. I will not say I'm in love. I can definitely buy this again, but I will continue on my search for a new and cost-efficient primer. I have used tons of Avon products for years because they work so well and they are very reasonably priced so I decided to give this a try.  I have what I like to call ""bi-polar skin.""  It just doesn't know what it wants to do.  I am 36 so I like to use age preventatives and have a hard time finding good ones because most products do not agree with me.  Either too dry, oily, greasy, etc.  I have oily places on my face and then areas so dry the skin flakes.  I used this product the first time by itself and then put my make-up over it.  It has a lotion appearance but goes on with a powdery-like finish.  It was great in the oily areas preventing my face from getting shiny & oily ALL day but the dry areas were still super dry.  The next day, I used my regular Anew Rejuvenate Day moisturizer (which is the BEST I have found for my skin type/s) and then put on the Magix as soon as it absorbed and then applied my make-up.  This worked perfect with the exception of a couple of super oily areas.  I now just avoid putting the moisturizer on those couple of spots (since Magix has SPF 20 also & I'm still protected) and then put the Magix all over followed by make-up.  It is fantastic!! Honestly, it really gives you a little sheer coverage too so you don't need much base or foundation for those who use it.  I use mineral powder and now use less due to the colorless coverage from Magix.  Great stuff!!  I just hope they never discontinue it as Avon often does! I have used a couple of drugstore primers in the last months, but wasn't very happy with them because they seemed to make my makeup do what primers are supposed to prevent (slide off, get greasy, sink into pores, oxidize, etc.) and I wear makeup every day. I had bought a tube of Avon Magix primer a while back (and a tiny tube lasts a long time) and I really loved it- my makeup was flawless, it lasted for hours still looking fresh, people complimented my skin and makeup and told me they'd never seen a complexion so beautiful, face was oil-free 12 hours later even if I have acne. Didn't clog pores, or upset my sensitive skin. Good to use on days you don't wear makeup as a kind of tinted moisturizer because it has SPF 20, does help even out skin tone, is moisturizing, and controls oil and shine. I got it through Avon for $6 but then it went out of stock (or something like a temporary discontinue, it was really weird, plus they upped the price to $10) and I needed it bad because it's my favorite stuff, so I found this seller on Amazon who had it for the same price was what I originally paid through Avon. My package actually arrived faster than Amazon's earliest estimated delivery date, was in original packaging, untouched, also bubble wrapped and the genuine product- seller is also super nice and I got a hand written thank you note and a heart pencil :)For a primer that costs $5-$6, it is way better than any drugstore primer I have used, and it's comparable to high-end primers like Smashbox Photo Finish Primer and Laura Mercier primers.Overall, I recommend this primer to anyone looking for a primer and the seller is very friendly and reliable.",4,3,1

Tinted Moisturizer,"This stuff is amazing. I bought this moisturizer/sunscreen on a wim after getting tired of trying sunscreens only to be left looking oily and sheer white. I have an light brown/medium skin tone but I'm also a male and thought it would look like I'm wearing makeup but I read many reviews raving about how it looked natural and evened out skin tone. On that note it does look incredibly natural and it even out redness I didn't even notice I had! I just ordered my 2nd tube, the first one lasted a bit over 5 months and I used it everyday except weekends where I used a higher spf which is one thing I wish this had. I tend to burn and peel easily so skimping on this doesn't cut it. So I still end up putting a higher spf sunblock on my nose and cheeks under this sunscreen. I like that it gives the skin on my face where I don't have skin issues like my cheeks a nice brightening dewy effect. But it you have super oily skin like me than it sucks that I can't use it on my forehead or nose because I end up looking like I just finished a marathon 10 minutes after putting it on. For those areas I just use Paulas choice sheer matte sunscreen (also tinted), its the only thing so far that I've found doesn't exacerbate my oiliness.It wouldn't be that bad if I just had oily skin but I also have giant pores and it just makes them more apparent. If this were a bit more mattifying and were spf30 at least it would be the perfect product. Okay...so couple of years ago went on the research hunt for products that would not emphasize my developing wrinkles, but would still give me a youthful sheen without being shiny enough to emphasize those wrinkles. (I'm 59 years old) I thought I found the perfect combination when I found Laura Geller tinted moisturizer with a final dusting of her balance and brighten foundation powder. People at work who didn't know I had switched products were commenting on how nice my skin was looking..just the right amount of youthful glow, not pasty or matte. Then Laura Geller discontinued her tinted moisturizer. So started trying other brands....unsuccessfully. Then I ordered The Balmshelter Tinted Moisturizer and it is great! Really smooth, covers well without looking like thick pasty foundation. I still use it with the Laura Geller powder dusted on top, and it is the perfect combination. I hope this company doesn't discontinue this product...if you have fair porcelain skin you will need the lighter shade, not medium, as this product does have excellent coverage without looking like makeup is on my face. I like the medium since I live in California and have enough sun and a few age spots to merit wearing medium even though blonde and of scandinavian heritage. I love this balm.  This may be my new ""go to"" makeup brand.  The balm is a lttle dark ,but It will look fine on me for most of the year.  April is usually when I am at my palest.  I really like this moisturizer.  It has a nice consistency, not super thick.  I have dry skin but if you have oily skin this maybe too oily shiny for you.  I like it cause my skin feels good after putting it on, which should be the case since it is a moisturizer.  I find so products, even though liquid, make my skin feel drier.Also since the lotion is NOT thick this product should last me longer than most.  Also I have purchase my tinted moisturizers at drugstores so I am trying to move away from that and get more higher end products.  This was perfect because the price wasn't outragous.  I was very happy with this purchase. I'm loving this right now, I've used Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer for that last 2 years, very expensive. If this stuff works out, I'm going to  be so happy. It's winter here in Colorado, need to use a moisturizer under this tinted moisturizer, but that's ok. Going to Cabo for the super bowl and that will be the big test, if it with stands the heat there, the dry here.....then it will definitely be my go to product. I've bought many a tinted moisturizers and have never really found a true perfect match, oh and I got the med. which is perfect for my non-tan winter skin. Not sure what I would do in the summer, probably be too light in the summer. ;(  updated 05/12/2016  Got the med/dark and I still  love this, it may be a little heavy for summer. I love Bare Escentuals new tinted moisturizer so I'll probably stick with that for the summer  and use the the balm for winter. I have pretty typical skin for someone of Nordic heritage - pale-ish in the winter, and tends toward burning in the summer, then tans later. I use the lighter version of this BB in the winter literally every day. It doesn't clog the pores of my combination skin, and just evens everything out nicely without looking like I'm wearing any makeup. My light freckles still show through, which I love. The yellowish undertones of this warm shade are flattering and natural-looking, and it moisturizes and makes skin look supple, youthful, and dewy without being oily. In short, pretty much the perfect all-purpose BB (beauty balm) that's become a staple in my beauty routine, which is fairly minimal. The seller initially sent me the wrong product, but gladly sent me the correct one when I called them, including a pre-paid bag to send the wrong one back to them. So, props to them for providing good service and making the customer happy! I don't like to wear foundation so I'm always looking for a tinted moisturizer that provides a bit of coverage. I like this one because it just evens out my skin. A little goes a long way and it's lite feeling. In the AM I start with my C-Serum, then my eye cream and I follow it up with this. It is the only one that I have purchased more than once. A tube will last me about 4 1/2 months using it once a day. I have really dry skin and I like the formula of this tinted moisturizer a lot. I apply it after a base moisturizer, and it gives a wonderful finish to my skin without feeling to heavy. However, there is no right color available for me. The medium is the correct shade but I need just a little more golden tone instead of beige. I found a Bare Minerals tinted moisturizer I like as well in the right shade. But if your skin is more beige undertones you will love this!",5,5,0

This was the pricey stuff in the 80s. I ran across a blog or something mentioning the pan stick and I immediately came to Amazon.I can't believe it.Under $10!!!!!  I have been using eastee lauder double wear for years...It's better than I remember.  I'm 50 now, so I demand more from a foundation...even without primer it went on so smooth with an even matte finish. I'm so excited! I'm buying up several. Just in case it disappears again. Been using this product for 65 years! Yes I said 65 years. Most amazing pan stick ever. Over the years I think the formula has changed a bit but still gives excellent coverage I grew up using this and it was my favorite! I’m glad I found it on here I will definitely order more! Great coverage I have always loved Max Factor’s pan stik. It’s easy to use, has great coverage, and stays put with no transfer. I just can’t believe how Max Factor has reduced its size from what it used to be. I wish they would bring back the “full” size. Makeup foundation. It goes on smoothly and covers very well. I've been using this for over 25 yrs I love it and I get alot of compliments ...after reading an article about Dolly Parton this product was her choice.  So I searched for it and Amazon has it.  I was pleasantly surprised.",3,5,-2

Aren't we all? lol. I inevitably always circle back to this one. Anytime I just want to give up and go back to one that I know will do its thing. No real major bells or whistles. I never get this thinking my lashes will reach heaven or be as thick as spaghetti. I get it knowing I will have good lashes that can actually be seen because without mascara I look lashless lol. It doesn't run down under my eyes making me look as if i haven't slept in a week because sadly I already look as if I haven't slept in days. The wand is good. Not so teeny tiny that I feel as if I'm sticking a needle in my eye and not so huge I feel as if I'm rolling a breadstick around it either. I have no doubt I will buy again. This mascara works really well. Makes my lashes really long, doesn’t smudge throughout a long day, and stays in place. Great product! Works well and makes lashes look long. Not clumpy and separates and curls your lashes. Recommend I have used this brand for years and I love it! It really makes my eyelashes Fuller, and longer without clumping and looking gooey. I serve with subs one and save too I bought this because of the commercial with queen latifah 😂 honestly there’s definitely better mascara out there. I like NARS Ive loved this mascara for years, I wear the non-water proof one so that I can take it off easily at night. I love how it makes my lashes look. I wear very black and I went through a phase where I liked the brown tint as well. The brown makes your lashes look more natural, and the black makes them pop. I would recommend this mascara to anyone who wanted a good, easy to remove mascara. I have used this mascara for 10+ years! People always say how long my lashes are!",5,5,0

recommended,Model in a Bottle Eyebrow Sealer with Mascara and brush applicator for flawless eyebrows all day,"The first time I bought this it was amazing, my brows didn’t budge until I removed them. This time I’m lucky if they last all day. Idk if they changed the formula but it’s definitely not what it used to be. Won’t buy again. Sometimes leave little white flakes on my eyebrows but I might be using too much, I have to paint it on with a brush because of I use the spooly it will scrape off my eyebrows color If I had never tried SheLaq by Benefit Cosmetics, I might have rated this product higher.  But I loved SheLaq and it is hard to beat.  Unfortunately, SheLaq has been discontinued and I had to find something else. Model in a Bottle is the next best thing.  I use an eye pencil to draw my eyebrows and then fill them in with brown powder.  I love my eyebrow creation but it can rub off, especially in the winter when I wear a hat that sits close to my brows. So I need a sealant.  The best way for me to use a sealant is to apply it to a 1.5"" square of paper towel and blot it onto my brows, pressing down to make sure it adheres. Some excess powder may come off but if I use the brush, the brow is much more likely to smear.  Luckily, you can remove the brush from Model in a Bottle.  And it definitely seals the brows.  But the problem is that it's a little hard to get off with Bi-facil makeup remover by Lancome which takes off any other kind of makeup I have ever used.  And it took off SheLaq!  I also tried two other removers but it was the same story.  I have to be careful not to rub too much because my eyebrows are delicate (slowly becoming thinner).  So I have to lather up my brows with cleanser and gently rub them after the makeup remover to completely remove Model in a Bottle.  Overall, it is worth the effort because it definitely seals my brows and looks good.  But I don't like it to be so hard to get off with standard removers. As other reviewers, I was skeptical about whether this 'Model In A Bottle Eyebrow Sealer' would work.  I have not had luck with other supposed ""wear-proof"" or ""long-lasting"" or ""water-proof"" brow products,  But I so desperately need something to keep my eyebrow color in place all day I decided to take a chance.  Boy am I glad I did!  I mostly need it for the two inner edges of my brows between my eyes where I have literally no hair left.  That part of the T-zone tends to get oily during the day, so no matter how great my brows look in the morning, they'd be faded or rubbed off by the afternoon.  I took the other reviewers' advice and started with very little product at first and have found a good process that works for me: using the spoolie brush, I wipe off a lot of liquid and with the actual spoolie part of the brush I brush through to set the two thicker parts of my brows and then with a light touch set the two tail ends where I do add some color.  Then without re-dipping the brush, I dot over the drawn-in areas on each brow with whatever product is left just using the pointy tip of the brush (i.e., not the spoolie.)  I let that fully dry, then check the color coverage (as others have said, sometimes the sealer does fade the color a bit) and then do another light coat just with the tip again on just those two penciled areas.  I've been doing this for over a week now and have definitely seen an improvement in how long the brow color lasts in those critical spots!  I also did some testing on the weekend by rubbing, scratching and wiping my face to see how it would hold up and while it's certainly not making the color indelible, it's MUCH better than without the sealer.  My only request would be if the bottle could be redesigned with some kind of stopper at the opening that would wipe some of the liquid off when you pull out the brush and more importantly prevent the liquid from spilling out if the bottle is tipped or dropped.  I am planning to order another bottle to keep as a back-up for that inevitable early morning oops.... Otherwise, I am definitely happy to report this product worked for me!! Okay, so, let me start by saying...although this is embarrassing to admit...I have no eyebrows. That's right...none. When I say I have no eyebrows, I mean it. It's not like when MOST people say they have no eyebrows, when what they really mean is, their eyebrows just aren't very visible. No, that's not me. I DO NOT have eyebrows. No hairs. At ALL. I have a really stupid hair pulling disorder, and in high school I-naturally-pulled them all out. I know, it's just as stupid as it sounds, but I can't help it. Anyway, due to pulling them out for so long, they completely stopped growing back. I'm now 27 years old. I have not touched my eyebrows in over 3 years in hopes to let them grow up, but not even a hair comes through. So, here is what I have to do EVERY SINGLE DAY of my life in order to have eyebrows. I have to first use tea tree oil around my brows because I have super-ridiculously oily skin. Then, I have to use a primer. I then apply cornstarch (another oil fighting tradition). THEN, I draw THE eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil. Then on top of that, I fill it in with an eyebrow powder. This takes a good 30 minutes of my make-up applying time. Needless to say, it's a nightmare. But, it's even more of a nightmare knowing that BECAUSE I have such terribly oily skin, I walk around all day long in fear that my fake ""eyebrows"" will come melting down my face at the slightest sign of humidity, and God forbid, rain...and that it will expose my eyebrowless face. I decided to give this a try because, quite frankly, I was desperate. I just needed SOMETHING that could keep my eyebrow make-up in place enough to lift SOME of my anxiety about them washing or melting off. I am PLEASED to announce that this product has been a MIRACLE. An absolute friggin' miracle. It does EXACTLY what it says it will do. Typically, after the first 1-2 hours of applying my eyebrows, they ALREADY start looking like they're just WAITING to slide down my face. But, not with this stuff. I'll admit, it certainly won't really hold them ALL DAY LONG....but, I can easily wear it for 8-10 hours without ANY smudging AT ALL. I've even TRIED to make it smudge after 30 minutes to an hour after applying...at that point, since it's still relatively new-on-face, it won't even come off on your finger! It's amazing. So, go for it. It's a great price, and you don't need much so this bottle has already lasted me right at 6 months and I've barely made a dent in it, and it works wonders. You can't go wrong. I won't lie, I've even used it on my eyeshadow a few times and it works great there, too!",5,5,0

A nice and natural look for gals that don’t want a ton of makeup and need a fast routine in the morning! I use this as my daily moisturizer after cleansing my face and love it. It has slight coverage and helps to even out my skin tone without feeling heavy or thick. I don't notice a sunburn but I have not used it solely as sunscreen when I am outside for a long period of time. I don’t wear full face foundation everyday.  This is just enough color.  During the winter, people’s skin is looking a little dull, this helps as a pick me up, until the warm weather hits.  It’s a wonderful product. I have been using this product for many years and will continue. Makes face looks smooth and clean. This is an inexpensive sunscreen for daily use that leave your skin with a nice glow. I ran it through my dermatologist and she said that it is fine. I use a moisturizer under it. Good product. Smooth, light coverage. Bonus sunscreen I have been using this product for years, and could not find it at Walmart, so I thought I would check on Amazon. I was very pleased to find a product that I love so much. However, did they change the color of the tint on the ""Light to Medium"" shade? My new one that I received is darker than normal. I like a light weight foundation for summertime and on days that I am not leaving home and love to have the added sun protection, especially since I am fair skinned.  This BB Cream seems a little more sheer than I have used before and didn't quite meet up to my expectations.",4,5,-1

The formula doesn’t damage eyelashes as it coats them.  Just use warm water and gently remove it. Tubing style doesn’t flake into eyes.  Easily removed with micellar water.  New favorite. It really makes your eyelashes look longer and thicker. My new favorite mascara 🥰. This mascara creates full lashes without raccoon eyes. Mascara was fine but the liquid kept getting concentrated on the brush and leaking from the tube no matter how tight or flat stored. Messy and clumpy. A shame - otherwise a nice product. I have oily skin and other mascara breaks down and smears all over my under eyes. This is a tubular formula and it prevents that transfer. I sometimes put it on top of less expensive mascara to lock it in. This is absolutely worth the money to me. I’ve been using it for 10 years and won’t go to any other formula. This mascara makes me look like I have fake lashes on. Not in obnoxious type of way but a natural set of lashes Beautiful full andAnd long.I can’t say I have short lashes I have a good amount of lashes and a healthy length but I finally found the perfect mascara that show it off. The application is simple easy perfect brush most importantly to take off it’s the best it rubs off in little pieces leaving no mess. And you can literally rub your eye and no raccoon eyes !!!  First mascara I’ve seen that doesn’t leave me with raccoon eyes no mess. I was a bit skeptical I’ve been wanting to purchase this mascara for months but the price was a little too high for me but I definitely recommend it and I will definitely continue to purchase this mascara money well worth I use Latisse to grow my lashes and I’m picky about mascaras I use. This is my favorite lengthening one! My lashes always look amazing & my eyes are never irritated,5,3,2

I love that it doesn't leave any residue or irritate my eyes or skin.One of the best things about this micellar water is that it's so easy to use. I soak a cotton pad and gently wipe it across my face, removing my makeup in one step. It's perfect for those late nights when I'm too tired to undergo a lengthy cleansing routine.Another thing I love about this micellar water is that it doesn't dry out my skin or leave it feeling tight like some other makeup removers can. Instead, it leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and refreshed.I highly recommend it. It's become a staple in my skincare routine, and I can't imagine going without it. Over the last few years, I’ve experimented with different luxury toners, such as Biologique Recherche, and micellar waters from brands like Simple. I found that my skin has never looked better with using fragrance free micellar water—my pores feel cleaned out when I use it day and night. Since my skin is so much healthier now, I don’t really need to use other products besides a simple serum and moisturizer, both from Joaquina Botánica. Note—I recommend using with the organic cotton pads from Cliganic. I am disappointed in the 3oz travel size because you can’t refill it which is wasteful and costly. Would love to see the brand fix that! I use two cotton pads, to make sure allmy makeup is removed! One does a goodjob, but to throughly remove all makeup,do it twice. It is very gentle and effectiveto remove all makeup, but then double cleanse with an appropriate cleanser, foryour skin type and proceed with your skin care routine. Been using this micellar water for the past 4+ years and it just works for me. After using Japanese/Korean cleansing oils that REALLY messed up my skin (like almost cystic acne that has taken 2ish years to recover from), I reverted back to using this before using a water cleanser and things got better, but that's because I just went back to my normal routine. I find myself scrubbing at my eyes to remove my lash glue and liner sometimes with Micellar water. I’ve tried all the different types and nothing works as well as THIS STUFF. This stuff is AMAZING for removing strong lash glue and very water proof eyeliner!! 11/10. Need to buy more!!! I have searched for an effective eye makeup remover which will take off tenacious magnetic lash liquid liner, yet is pretty gentle on the delicate eye area.This seems the best I have found so far.If they ever make them in pre-moistened cleansing pads, rounds or wipes, in indidual sealed purse packets, that will be even better yet. I love this Micellar water it doesn’t dry my skin out like alot of them do plus I have sensitive skin and this is the only one that has worked for me. happy that it is fragrance free! This is the best makeup remover. It isn’t oil based and does a great job clearing my skin. It isn’t harsh on my skin either. It’s definitely my go to for a safe remover choice",3,1,2

To be exact, since 2010 I started using it. For those who search for growing long eyelashes, let me share my experience why Mavala is better than other products.I had used Latisse, Vegamour, LeuLash, RapidLash, RevitalLash ..., you name it, I probably had tried them before. Latisse is expensive and required prescription (unless you buy it from a doctor's office that they know you). I used Latisse for almost six months and had to stop because it was causing too much irritation. My eyes were red and dried, and the long lashes didn’t stay too long, they dropped off easily. My friend who used Latisse had hairs grown near her eyes, near ear areas, perhaps due to rubbing her eyes after application.Other eyelash serums or lashes-lengthen alternatives have different ingredients but their applications more or less the same, using a simple applicator that looks like an eye liner to apply on eyelids once a day. Without going into a lengthy discussion, a gentle reminder is to check the ingredients by googling them for safety and avoid some eyelash serums that can cause potentially dangerous side effects such as ocular irritation, hyperemia, iris color change, macular edema and ocular inflammation, that may cause allergy, especially to people with sensitive skin.Mavala is not a magic serum, it works slowly. When I used other serums, I sometimes get eye redness and itchiness, or in worst scenario, my eyes became drier. Mavala doesn’t cause such problem. It works slowly so don’t expect lengthy lashes overnight. While other serums might give you lengthy lashes, Mavala gives you thinker lashes. I also find that my lashes don’t drop off quickly compared to using other brands. I apply Mavala once a day after shower, under my upper eyelids and eyebrows. Over the years, many people have complimented my thick eyebrows and eye lashes. Mavala didn’t give me any irritations. I am a forgetful person even if I forget to apply Mavala (especially traveling and sometimes just forgot), my eye lashes stayed the same. Certainly, I do always go back to using it. By the way, if you have the patience to apply multiple coats, and cover your entire lashes with the serum (brush them all the way to the end), it does help to grow longer lashes. In the beginning (first few years) I did that, but now I am happy with the results and don’t bother to work harder. My lashes grow thicker in several rows of lashes, I can see it using a 5x magnifying mirror.To summarize, I love Mavala as it gives me stronger and thicker eye lashes without eye irritation. It is made in Switzerland. The reason I give it four stars is because the price increase is too much! I started buying from Amazon in 2012. I just checked the price, it was only $15 in 2012... fast forward to recent years, $27.50 in 2019 and now $37 before tax!If you find this review useful, please give me an encouraging “helpful” pat on the shoulder. Like you, we all depend on meaningful reviews to help us in our buying decision. Happy shopping! It is expensive! Yes it is but it is ok to use. When I was pregnant with my son 30 years ago, I noticed my lashes were starting to thin/fall out.  I don’t know if it was hormonal or what.  They never really recovered.  Fast forward to about 10 years ago when I saw this reviewed on a makeup website.  I decided what the hell…it wasn’t super expensive.  I used for about 3 weeks before I saw results and it really worked!!!  I use it now as just part of my bedtime routine.  It sits on my nightstand and I just run the wand across the lashes on my closed eye.  I have longer and fuller lashes.  When I quit using it for a period of time about 5 years ago, my lashes went back to being more sparse and not as long.  So it’s just part of my routine now.  For me, I suffer zero side effects.  It’s not expensive and it does what it says….every product should strive for that and Mavala hit the nail on the head! The application brush is nice and dense the formula is white not clear so it leaves a bit of white if it dries on skin and I’m using it on my eyebrows also, so far I think is working infusing good stuff into hair shafts I must say that I have, indeed, seen a difference in my lashes since I have been using this product.  I haven't used other lash products so I can't compare the Mavala against others out there, but I know they make quality nail products and the price was very economical so I didn't think there was much to loose in giving it a try.  About three weeks have passed and I didn't see any difference for the first couple of weeks but was faithful in an every night application thinking at least its good nurishment against the mascara.  I have almost the most non-existant eyelashes ever and weak brows.  My lashes are short and sparse, and so light they are almost transparant.  Because they are so skimpy, wearing mascara always just emphasized how sparse they were - if I tried to remedy that with more mascara, it was just a gloppy, over-dramatic mess, even when using the really good mascaras.  After being without mascara for about a week recently (allergy season here in Virginia) but still using Eye-Lite each night, I took a second look, and then a third, to make sure I saw what I thought I saw.  To my surprise when I put on mascara my lashes actaully seem to have doubled in thickness and are also longer!  They are still almost transparent, and the Eye-Lite hasn't made them darker (Eye-Lite  doesn't claim to do so) but when I put on mascara the difference in my lashes was really noticable. I even feel more resistance when the wand goes through them, when I never noticed that before. (okay, maybe I'm splitting hairs saying that, no pun intended, but I am impressed!)  I am going to FAITHFULLY use this product - it is truly a mini-miracle for me. Five Stars is a high rating, and some people who already have good lashes may not see the difference in their lashes that I did - but all I can say is that I had few lashes before and now I have MORE, the product didn't irritate my eyes, price was very reasonable, and as always, it's easy and convenient to shop Amazon.  To me that all adds up to Five Stars.",1,5,-4

The last few mascara bottles I've had were the CoverGirl Professional in Very Black, which comes in the blue bottle and with a curved or straight brush. That mascara was good for everyday wear in the office. I really loved it because it separated my eyelashes, which are thick and curly, and didn't clump. However, I wanted a mascara that adds volume in addition to separating and a little bit of lengthening, so I tried this one. I love it! It's easy to put on, doesn't have a smell, doesn't clump, and is easy to take off in the evening. My only issue with the brush is that if I'm not extremely careful, I end up with some brush marks on my upper lid. This might be because I have a mono-lid and all mascara brushes tend to do that to me. For the price, I am sticking to this mascara. I have tried so many mascara s and finally found something that doesn't turn into raccoon eyes after a few hours.  This is marketed as smudge proof and I'd say they got this right.  Love that it easy washes off at the end of the day.  A ridiculously affordable mascara that I will buy again and again.  love that it has a good amount of ""work"" time before it starts to dry up. It's good mascara.  doesn't smudge and easy to apply.  I absolutely hate clumps, so I wipe the brush with a tissue before applying.  That's probably why I don't notice the 'super thick.' This is a good product, but no better than similar products marketed by other companies. It would depend on the price whether I would purchase this product again. The mascara is waterproof and the straight brush is my preference.  But the cap cracked the first time I used it -- couldn't put this in a travel or gym bag. This mascara goes on nicely and doesn't flake or smudge. It didn't perform as well as my usual brand (Clinique) at making my lashes look longer and thicker. Flakes - It is okay for mascara but it gives me raccoon eyes and flakes on my cheeks. This is a good mascara. It works well on its own and gives length and volume.",5,3,2

In my opinion and experience,  since this has been discontinued, I assume the current stock that is being sold is probably several years old and drying up and  sometimes you get one that will only last for a few times and then I have to wet the brush (and the color gets lighter) and hope it works, then sometimes you get lucky and you get one that will last several times. It's hit and miss. I love this product. I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that it doesnt last very long at all. I've been buying this for years. I ordered online because Walmart stopped carrying the brown/black color. Love that it glides on very thin & I havent been able to find another like it. BUT I hate the fact that I have to buy it often. I've had it now for about 3 weeks & already the color is looking watery. So, if you don't mind buying often, this liner is perfect. I have used this eyeliner for years, but it seems that the ones that I have received lately get watery more quickly than they used to. After what seems like a week or two they leave just a faint light brown line. Maybe I have to spend more to have an eyeliner that lasts for weeks of applications. I am going to try the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof and see if that lasts longer so I don't feel like I am constantly replacing them. Covergirl liner is waterproof and when the eyeliner is new and dark it is a good product so I may go back to it and just buy them more often. I've had great success with this liner.  I use it inside the lash line on my upper lid only.  It makes a subtle, natural looking base for lashes darkened with mascara.  Its usage depends on two things:  it should be shaken before each application to bring the product ""down"" onto the tip, and it must be warm to flow properly.  If it's stored in a cool place, it can be safely warmed by placing it, tightly capped, in a cup with an inch of warm water while  applying the rest of your makeup. I find it lasts as long as my tube of mascara, which is a couple of months.  I really like the small size of the tube; makes it easier to handle.  I'll be disappointed if I can no longer find it through Amazon. This product is no longer being manufactured and it is the only eyeliner I have ever really liked - and have tried literally dozens. So bought a few on amazon to stash away and just bought another. This one looked like it had been picked up at a garage sale after sitting in someone's garage for a few years. Package bent and dirty. Hopefully will not affect the product. the tube itself doesn't last that long- only about a couple weeks if you're putting it on every day. the tip dries out, and if you run it under hot water to get it flowing again, it is a lighter color. however, when you first get the product, it looks really nice. Easy on, easy off.  I'm 68 and light skinned and light colored hair so the brown is good on me...not too harsh. This was always my go-to eyeliner.  I loved it because it was a great color that went on with one stroke and never ran.  Something has changed.  Its not what it used to be.  Did Cover Girl change the formula?  It doesn't matter where I buy it...in the past 2 years every one I have bought feels like it is very watered down and it runs out so quickly.  There's no life or body to this eyeliner anymore.  :(",3,5,-2

It’s also very affordable and a little goes a  long way. It has never irritated my eyes / skin and it’s fairly easy to remove for it being waterproof. Try it ! Love the tiny brush and long lasting It’s waterproof and long lasting but not smudge-proof. I love this eyeliner best i have used yet Loved the price, easy to apply, brush is cheaply made so not thinking it will last long. Is waterproof, but at the end of the night it sorry of just peels off like latex paint. It doesn’t smudge, AT ALL This is my go to eyeliner for years.

recommend product goung middle age lady,"Maybelline New York Cover Stick Concealer, Light 2, 0.6 oz, Ivory, , 1.0 Count","This works great;  contrary to popular belief you should not match the concealer to your skin color. You should go 2-3 shades darker, when you’re using it to cover the under eye area. You can also use yellow which cancels out black (for those under eye bags) and green cancels out red. (for example, if you have a rudy complexion or red blemishes, the green will cover that well, and then go over it with the deep beige concealer and feather it, and fan it out in a circle pattern around the blemish and it works great. I just take the crayon stick and put it in a V pattern at the bridge of my nose area with The V wings that go above the eyebrows and then I put it in a full circle up and lower lid on the eye area and then I put it in the creases of my laugh lines, and one line clear underneath my chin from corner of the jawbone to the jawbone on the other side so that I can remove any shadows, so my face looks flawless, but virtually untouched. Light make up with no filter looks best.  Make sure to blend everything in so there  are no visible lines of demarcation. I've always had dark pigmentation under my eyes, starting in my teen years. Since then, I have tried hundreds of concealer products, potted creams, and lighter liquid varieties, all different types, brands, and price points. Out of all of them, the most natural-looking coverage is with Maybelline's NY Concealer Cover Stick. It's easy to apply, matches my skin tone perfectly, is long-lasting, and never pools up or creases into fine lines. It's an incredible value too at only $5.98. Can't beat that! I use this under my foundation to help lessen the redness caused by Rosacea. It definitely makes a difference! Perfect creamy inexpensive concealer! It's a less toxic cheaper dupe of Glossier's Stretch concealer. I will definitely be repurchasing. I purchased the Green cover stick. I've never tried it before. In fact I would of never believed a Green cover stick would even work. But it does, it's really an amazing product.  Coverage that works and lasts all day. Cover it up and forget it. 💚 very creamy, does the job There are a few spots on my face that are darker than the rest of the skin, like darker under eye splotches and reddish skin near nostrils. When I want to cover them, this stuff works great. It covers without drying out the skin. Lus, it’s not expensive- always a plus. My husband uses it to cover his purpora on his hands and arms -- does the trick better than anything else.",1,5,-4

It's not sticky and doesn't make my brows hard. Good purchase not a bad price. It is good as described I was looking for something like nyx brow glue with a bigger wand but I didn't find it with this. It's a very watery consistency so it will hold already up brows in place but it won't get them up which isn't the best. Easy to use. Brows looked natural and weren't crunchy! Good for eyebrows and lashes Dries nicely and doesn’t flake up like other brow gels I’ve tried. This has been my go-to clear bro gel since high school and I still love it. It smells nice, isn’t irritating and doesn’t leave a residue or pill up, and it doesn’t make your brows stiff or sticky either. It holds them in place while feeling light and natural! So I know technically this is a brow gel, *but I use it as both a brow gel AND a clear mascara (I've given up on colored mascara, really).  This product is AMAZEBALLS.  It goes on smooth, it's non irritating (and gurl my eyes are SENSITIVE), it's cruelty free, and it looks so nice and clean on the face.  I find it really ads polish to any makeup look I can create.  I did a smokey eye recently and I didn't know if the lash definition would hold up to the intense look but it DID.  Plus, I've been using this for months, and I believe it's been making my eyelashes grow.  I checked the ingredients and it is fortified with castor oil so that would make sense (and this was something I wasn't really expecting from the product so WIN).  But hands down, best brow and lash product ever, I don't ever want to go without it.  Tube lasts pretty long, too, so it's definitely worth it.  Treat yoself.",4,4,0

Stays on couple hours. For the color & price currently right now I would order again! :) I've loved Covergirl Continuous Color lipstick in the color Rose Quartz since the 1980s. It's still as beautiful as I remember it. The color is very flattering on my fair skin. Moisturizing. Feels a tad tacky but that’s part of the moisturizing feel. It does not transfer to cup or napkin. Lasts through eating, drinking hot drinks, brushing teeth and sleeping overnight. I did need olive oil to remove it gently the day AFTER I applied it because it had finally started to feel like it was flaking. If I had removed it at the end of the same day I applied it, I would never have known it could or would flake. It lasted me a full 24 hours and that’s saying a lot. Extremely sheer looking yet imparts the light pink I need to hide my very red natural lip tone. Went back to Amazon and bought sugared almond for a slightly different color. Love this lipstick! I’ve been looking for this color for a very long timeI wore this color as a teen and I can’t get enough of it Nice color a tad dry but overall this is a nice product easy to purchase here rather than the store. Goes on smooth and easy. It doesn't require a second coat either. Long lasting. Nice color, great product, fast delivery,good price. I recommend this product. !

The first time I tried it my eyelashes looked spidery. I realized I wasn't using the applicator correctly; for all mascaras, you have to roll up with the applicator, not just brush it on. (I mean ok, you could just brush it on, if that's the style you like.) To really get the most out of mascaras, you must be precise and take your time when applying the coats. Roll up a few times, try wiggling the brush, roll it up while blinking, etc. The results will be worth it! (I also sprayed on some makeup-lasting spray. How did women live without that??) Again, take your time and really be rigid when applying masacaras, and your eyes and lashes will look AMAZING! Best mascara I’ve used. I’ve ordered for years. The last four tubes were not correctly packaged. They were actually waterproof and I had to return. The packaging was identical to this one. This one is DRAMATIC VOLUME, SMUDGEPROOF. I am not a fan of the waterproof. I’ve been using this product for over 20 years and hard to find in stores. I’ve been using this mascara for 4 decades. This latest delivery is wrong. It doesn’t behave like MF 2000 calorie, at all. i bought this mascara because i ran out of the maxfactor mascara i have used since i was a teenager, (maxfactor lashmaker in a light blue tube), i moved to the states about 7 months ago and i brought with me two tubes but didn't realize they were about done, so i tried looking for an alternative. I use this mascara because i have very long lashes but very straight and with every other mascara, after i curl them they go back to being completely flat (it doesn't matter if i curl them before or after application), so with the maxfactor blue mentioned i would curl them so they had a nice curve and then apply one coat of mascara and i would be good to go. I know that having long lashes may not seem a problem to some, but even though they don't need as much product if I don't curl them properly they look like spider legs, just sticking up unevenly.I bought Clinique lash doubling mascara (14 at macys) i thought because clinique is such a respected brand i would give it a try, same problem.I also bought Covergirl natureluxe mascara (about 9 at walmart) i saw the commercial for it and it was advertised as being a very light mousse so i thought this may do the trick, no luck.I also got recently a makeup kit from Sheer cover minerals, and it came with a mascara, still the same problem.As a last resort, i tried looking for Maxfactor mascaras online and saw this one from Amazon, the mascara arrived much earlier than the estimate which was great, however the product is not as good as the Maxfactor lashmaker, even though it holds the curl in my lashes much better than all the other mascaras mentioned, it usually dries unevenly, by this i mean that some lashes dry quicker than others and i end up whit some up and some down :(At the moment what i'm doing is, i curl my lashes and i apply a light coat of my old mascaras ( i soaked them in hot water to get the last bit of product out), let lashes dry, and then apply a light coat of 2000 calorie mascara.The mascara does create a dramatic effect with a very light coat, i have found it a bit more difficult to remove than the other 3 mascaras, but overall i think this is a good product, i believe for someone than doesn't have the same problem as me would be satisfied with the length this mascara creates, i'm much happier with this purchase than with the Clinique mascara, which didn't do anything for my lashes, kind of make them look shorter! hope this helps! Glad to find this mascara on Amazon again, though some of the reviews aren’t too encouraging.I would like to say, for those who say it dries up quickly—I read a hint once and it greatly extended the life of my mascara. When it starts getting dry, add 3-5 drops of distilled water to the tube. It has worked great for me. Good luck! Been looking for a mascara with a good brush that doesn't clump and lump. So far this goes on easily with no clumps. However it is a little difficult to remove even with make up remover. I used to use this mascara years ago.  I was happy to see that you could now get it at Amazon.  I had not used it in quite some time so I forgot how it performed.  Compared to Two Faced- Better than sex, Benefit- They're Real and It -Superhero, it does not have as much drama.  I will say though that if you want a natural, everyday look, then this mascara fits the bill.  The applicator separates each lash for a natural, wispy look. I personally though like more drama and length, which I could achieve with this mascara, but I had to put on about 4 coats.  I tried putting a coat of It Superhero, followed by a coat of the 2000 Mascara and that works well.  It does come off easy, which is a plus.  However, it does not cake or smear.  Good mascara for the price.",5,4,1

I like it and have been using it everytime I apply makeup to see if It will become a fav. Don’t think so, although it is pretty, but I’m very fair complected and like a bit more pop of color in my blushes. One of my favorite brands, even over expensive ones. In fact I need to order another shade for a bronzer! Love this. This was much paler than I expected but should mix well with some products I already have. Not too much glimmer. Good quality and sturdy packaging. Just be sure you really want this light a shade! I use this high on my cheekbone with a slightly deeper tone on the lower outside edge. Lasts all day. Good color saturation. Good I love this product. Very natural looking. You can layer it if you want it darker but I’m 53 and need a more natural look to my makeup colors. Usually I've done well with ordering makeup on Amazon.  They usually package it is bubble wrap.  But this time, the blush was completely broken and crumbled.  I was pleased to get a refund without having to send it back.  The tender rose color is quite deep, so I'm not sure I would have liked it anyway.  I would go back to tender flush (light peach).",3,5,-2

Between this an a powder, I make my rosacea look like it’s “going away” even though it’s actually “freshly red”.  The only negative I had was that it took a few pumps to try to get a little out.  Not complaining about the little amount that does eventually come out since a small amount goes a long way, just that I really had to pump it multiple time to get anything and it made me think the bottle was defective at first. It's a bit expensive but worth it. I first bought it at Costco for a pretty good price ... but sadly, Costco stopped carrying it. I resisted buying it at the rather high price and tried a 'ton' of other primers In the hopes that I could find one as good. Nope ... not even close. The sheerness and how easy it goes on is awesome. I neither like it nor dislike it. The majority of the ingredients seem like they would be beneficial for sensitive skin. I don't use it regularly, but so far it feels fine on my skin.  It goes on light and fresh, and dries quickly. There is a scent, but it appears that is is from one of the natural ingredients and not an artificial synthetic one. I'm prone to scent nausea and am sensitive to fragrances, and this product doesn't affect me, though it did surprise me at first. The scent doesn't seem to linger nor is it unpleasant- just kinda strong at first.Although it feels fine on skin, I didn't really notice that it helped with the redness of my rosacea. Maybe I need to apply more than I normally would a primer.  I didn't expect it to conceal, but I figured it would tame the red more. So that being said, it is definitely not a concealer, and I am just say that because some might be thinking it will cover more..  so if you need more coverage you will need to look for a different product. I will continue to use it up, but it currently stands as being something I neither like nor dislike. I would give it 3 stars for that but the fine ingredients make it worthy of 4. I will add more information if need be after more continued and regular use. This primer does good things for my makeup and my skin. Bodyography's primer has that certain silky consistency that I love in a primer and sets a great base for my foundation. Not only does this extend the wear time of my foundation, but my skin seems to love the stuff.I initially tried the primer through a monthly subscription box. Taking the price into consideration, I wasn't all that impressed at first. Yes, the consistency was nice and it did help with my foundation, but I thought that it took too long to set. When this is applied, your skin will most definitely feel like there's primer hanging out on your face. Just sitting there, slowly setting. When it sets, it's glorious. However, it's the one thing that I still don't like about this product. Thankfully, I ended up just summoning up an ounce of patience and used the (generous) sample in its entirety over the course of a month or so. A little does go a long way, by the way.People commented on how smooth my skin looked while I was using it, and I had one of those weird moments where you look in the mirror and notice a big change in your appearance. When I ran out of the sample and tried some other primers, I noticed that my skin seemed to be steadily growing a bit rough around the edges.Needless to say, I quickly found my way back and I'm currently on my second bottle. I will be repurchasing again!Extra Information:I have combination skin. Moderately oily in some areas, extra dry around the nose and under the eyes, with the occasional hormonal breakout. The primer covers each of the areas very well. Fabulous face primer.  Very smooth on skin I have rosacea and it's difficult to find makeup that will cover it so it's not so prominent. I've tried a bunch of other green tinted makeup primers from the big box stores (elf, Cover Girl, Maybelline, etc.) but all of them didn't do anything. It was just like applying clear makeup. However, the Bodyography primer absolutely works as advertised. My face is like one of those before and after makeup pictures that you see in magazines. You can visually see that the redness is covered. This primer is also very lightweight and has no greasiness whatsoever. You can apply it and then apply foundation right away. It has a very smooth, matte feel rather than the wet liquidy feel of the drugstore brands.I have been using the Bodyography green tint primer and Bodyography Foundation #150 together and you can't see ANY redness at all when I'm done applying. Highly recommend for anyone who has an uneven skin tone. I have been using this primer since I owned my hair styling salon.Everyone of my clients asked for me to pick them up a couple,and they loved it also.I have tried others and this brand is the best, in my opinion.",5,5,0

And that was to dark for me.It is a little hard to find the right colors for me.but when you go in to the bare minerals on amazon they give you a decription of the colors. then all you have to know what looks good on.and once you know what looks good you know how to pick the colors for your self.I found another lipstick color that I like i just might get for myself. I have looked everywhere for Bare Essentials Bread Pudding lipstick without any luck (seems it has been discontinued).  I was so happy to have found several tubes of it through Amazon.  Someone at lunch yesterday asked me where I found my lipstick as the color looked so great on me.  She indicated that her own lipstick color had been discontinued and I suggested she try Amazon like I had. This is very creamy & moist. That's good because I have very dry lips. The downfall is, after I used it twice, the lipstick actually came out of the tube.  It cracked off at the bottom.  There was a post paid return slip with it when I received the purchase, but I misplaced it.  I would have returned it if I could have found the slip. I like this lipstick. It goes on really smooth and the color is pretty. The color is a lttle darker than I thought it would be. I layer some gloss or my burt;s bees lip shimmer over it. I like this lipstick smooth and no odor. Seems long wearing. slightly darker for fair people- will use for evening shade. probably good everyday for people with medium tones. Not too red-or pink-or brown. to me a perfect shade- This is the only place I can still find the Fig color, which is pretty much the only lipstick color that goes with my fair skin, red hair and green eyes without overwhelming me. It's a bluer-red that glides on with one swipe and lasts quite some time. I love the moisturizing benefits, and knowing it's paraben free makes it my choice of lipstick. I ordered 3, my favorite color.  My car was broken into and my purse was stolen and one was in there along with a new compact.  I think I was more upset about losing that than my purse.  Definitely not about the $300 for the new window!They arrived on time and in great shape. The color was a little darker than expected, but looks great and has a great feel on my lips, keeping them soft and moist.",5,2,3

If you use the primer, give it time to fully dry so that the powder doesn't get yucky from dipping the sponge back in it wet.  Oh, I also use Jane Iredale sponges to apply the powder.  They are also great.  The powder is amazing because it covers up redness, little dark spots, anything at all.  It's really, really the best powder ever, better than the most expensive powders out there that I've tried.  The color I use (natural) looks a little white when I first apply it, but by the time I put a little highlighter on my forehead and a little blush on (along with eye shadow, etc.), it looks, well, natural. This powder is very light & comfortable to wear!  You can wear it on your face for a light co vet age or heavier if you need it!  You will really like it. Not loose powder which is much better.  It is also refillable. I carry one in my purse also!  You will be glad you tried it!! This powder provides a smooth finish with nice coverage that is not too heavy. The powder provides a very natural look over the Jane Iredale tinted moisturizer I use. I’ve had break outs in the past with press powder, but I’ve never had a break out with this product. I also love that all of Jane Iredale‘s products are cruelty free and certified by leaping bunny. This was recommended to me by my dermatologist because liquid foundation shows the dry spots on my face. I really like this product. I got it for everyday wear to conceal my redness, and it doesn’t make me breakout. However, I’m not keen on the price. Hopefully this will last me awhile. It’s annoying the case doesn’t fit a puff to apply this on the go. You have to carry a brush or puff separately. Makes this not very portable. Color matches well, but it still feels too powdery when applied.  I like the refill option, less waste. Good product Great product - it's been my brides foundation of choice for years.",5,5,0

It covers slight discoloration and redness, without drying out or greasing up my skin! (I have dry-combo skin). It’s very easy to apply and lacks a strong fragrance, which is a plus because my skin is very sensitive. I haven’t attributed a single breakout to this foundation. When I use this product, I go right in with a damp beauty sponge, but you could certainly use a flat foundation brush as well. In short, I’d certainly recommend this foundation to someone with sensitive, dry-combo skin who is looking for a natural finish. Color is true to swatch. Coverage is excellent but not too heavy. Moisture content is balanced and not greasy/oily. I have used this for many, many years and love it! This is my favorite, it’s perfect for me. So happy that Amazon is carrying it because Walmart stopped carrying the lightest shade, the one I need. I’ve been using this foundation for years and I’m always being asked “What brand do you use ?” I’m in my late 60’s but younger woman have used it from my recommendation’s. It covers well, but not to heavy looking, it’s light. I always use Classic Tan as it gives my face a radiant look. Better than the more expensive brands, sad it’s pretty much online only now. Used this kind for a very long time I've used this item for years. It provides decent coverage, but still looks natural. It's just enough to even out skin tone, but not enough to cover blemishes, freckles, etc. It has a nice, creamy texture, goes on smooth, but what I like most is it doesn't cake in my fine lines. I can look in a magnifying mirror and still not see anything in the fine lines. Great for older women with aging skin. It is very smooth but too sheer. Does not cover dark undereye circles.",5,5,0

Mascara (Brown),"I really loved this Ecco Bella mascara but after 3 weeks it dried out, it's very thick and almost hard. What can I dilute this with???? Natural ingredients are most important to me and this mascara is very natural which makes me happy. The first time I wore it, it did run and I looked like Racky raccoon by the time I got home but I avoided any oils near my eyes after that and it wore well enough after that.It thickens nicely, looks good and is easy to work with. When you separate the lashes about halfway to being dry, it doesn't flake and looks very natural.Another so called ""natural"" mascara caused my lashes to thin, but this one, so far, isn't doing that, so overall I'm plate I have been using this mascara for years. It gives my lashes definition and average volume good for everyday wear. The brush is soft on my lashes and easy to use. The color is the perfect brown and doesn’t make my pale skin look washed out. Added bonus is the mirror on the tube - I can apply it without my glasses on without leaning over the sink to see in the bathroom mirror. Holy grail mascara and I will buy it again and again. Thank you for being cruelty free. I have been using this for ten or more years. I have allergies to fragrance, formaldehyde and dyes,  so all mascaras irritate my eyes. The fumes are too strong. This is the only mascara that doesn't bother me. Ecco Bella FlowerColor Plant Based Vegan Mascara (Black) goes on very light. I want volume, so I continued to dip the wand and apply. I found even more success for volume when I allowed it to dry for a little while before making another application. Dries well. Doesn't run or smudge.I'm very happy with how this looks and works.I found it was useful beyond mascara, that I can dab the tip of an eyeliner brush on the end of the mascara wand to collect some product and apply like a liquid eyeliner, another product I have struggled to find a safe version of.I have had NO symptoms or allergic reactions from this mascara. I even slept in it overnight and still no symptoms. It also stayed in place well too. Washed off easily with a washcloth.The reason I decided to give Ecco Bella Mascara a try was because of the guarantee and return policy. When there is a product claim for ""all-natural"" ""for sensitive eyes and skin,"" ""Vegan, Cruelty-Free, paraben-free, gluten-free and fragrance-free"" the 100% Satisfaction Guarantee gives me exactly what I need to take a risk.I have evaluated literally hundreds of mascara brands, scouring ingredient lists to ensure that known offenders wouldn't be in there. However, the problem for me are the unknown offenders. Uncovering problem ingredients seems to be a never-ending effort.This is why I need manufacturers to stand behind their product with satisfaction guarantees and a fair return policies, because usually it doesn't work out. Trying something new is an expensive proposition. So I won't even try something unless that is in place. I simply don't have that kind of money.Coming up empty handed in the marketplace, I tried making my own mascara -- which was clumpy if it wasn't runny. I just couldn't get a consistent formula. Making my own makeup is NOT what I want to do with my time. And I don't want to be sick, so I've not been wearing any for a long time.I wish I could say where I heard about this product. Maybe it was from my MCS group or from a Google Search on ""chemically safe"" or ""non-toxic"" mascaras. Whatever the path, I'm very glad I found it.It's everything I want in a mascara generally, but also everything I want as someone who has severe Multiple Chemical Sensitivities.I'm looking forward to see how long it takes for this to be used up or dried out and will revise this listing again when that happens so you can know about the shelf life I experience.As long as the company maintains its current formula and delivers this product as I am experiencing it now and also can also show me a decent shelf life, I will be a lifelong customer. I always use vegan and clean mascara and decided to try Ecco Bella’s brown mascara for the first time and had really high hope because of so many good reviews.  Applied it for the first time and didn’t like it immediately. Decided to give it a chance and tried it again twice, didn’t like it at all. The mascara container looks like empty or like when your product is about to run out and you are trying to get last drops out of it. Mascara itself is so dry while applying and after couple hours smudges under your eyes ,your face and cheek bones. It gives Zero volume to your lashes . There wasn’t any expiration date on the container so I wouldn’t know that mine is like this or this is the nature of the product.  For this price I had much much much higher expectations !!! I guess I go back to the brand I already have.",4,3,1

Loose Setting Powder, Absorbs Oil, Leaves Face Looking and Feeling Smooth, Helps Makeup Last Longer For a Flawless, Fresh Look","I’ve tried many setting powders in the search for the best one that would work for me. Most setting powders were too thick, still caused me to crease, the wrong color, or graying. For background, I’m South Asian with medium warm skin with a yellow undertone. I also have really stubborn hyperpigmentation. Unfortunately, after covering my hyperpigmentation the best I could with makeup, setting powder tended to make it prominent again. Very weird effect. This setting powder I found after some online research, I tried it, and it is better than even high end brands! I’ve tried so many: Fenty, Laura Mercier, Hourglass, etc etc and this one by far has my favorite application, lightweight, non-creasing. It still causes me to feel a little gray (I got the natural color), but I correct that by putting a loose foundation powder before setting powder, which helps a lot. My skin feels like nothing is on it with this setting powder, whereas other setting powders I can see on my face and creases extremely around my smile lines, and feels like another packed layer on top. I think this is best applied with a powder puff, which you can also get the triangle powder puffs from Amazon. I wouldn’t prefer using a brush if you want to see the smooth effective results. Oh, this also has a strong baby powder smell, so don’t inhale it lol, but I don’t think it’s bad or unbearable. Definitely smells better than the Laura Mercier powder.I would recommend trying this atleast once. A lot of people tend to get high end products but don’t realize other products could work just as well or better, and may be more beneficial to your skin as well (check the ingredients and compare, it depends on your preference). I use this concurrently with setting spray as well (which I spray between layers of makeup) As someone with deep smile lines + under eye fine lines (can’t afford my usual Botox at the moment) and severely combination to oily skin, I do not have the luxury of forgoing setting powder. If I don’t use setting powder, my face is a slippery, creasing disaster. Some of my HG powders include Huda Beauty Easy Bake, Pacifica Cherry Matte, Nars Translucent Crystal powder loose + pressed versions, and IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores Loose Powder (gorgeous but causes horrific flashback, full on Flashback Mary soo not flash friendly).I need to bake every time I wear foundation/concealer but what happens is I end up dehydrating my skin so bad that when I smile I form a bunch of fine lines that are not normally there. I can’t win. While my usually faves are $25+ (except one that is $12) they all have their issues so I’m constantly searching; now enter this Palladio rice powder.As a student, I’m poor to say the least but I’ll beg, borrow, and steal to cop any makeup that I need - regardless of that notion, it hurts to shell out tons of money that I don’t have for good makeup so when I saw $8.99 for a setting powder I became immediately intrigued. I’m familiar with rice powder and the benefits of using rice starch in makeup for its amazing oil absorbing capabilities so I felt confident in the product’s claims regarding its efficacy. I used it today and OMG, this is perhaps my new HG powder.Whenever I use setting powder, the severity/longevity of wear before my foundation forms creases determines my liking for it. One of my favorite foundations, IT CC cream, is one of the worst offending, easily creasing products on my skin because of its emollience - something remedied little by even baking. When I got this in the mail today I immediately ripped it open and started doing my makeup with IT CC cream, which to me, is the ultimate test of a powders setting capability. I was seriously so blown away. (PS I’m fair, so I used the shade translucent and the results really shocked me.)Usually as soon as I finish my makeup, ask anyone who lives with me, I will not SMILE at all until I’m at my destination as to preserve my look from creasing (if I’m driving, I’ll also blast the AC on my face to keep my skin matte too, how pitiful right?) In general, as soon as I have any movement on my face, it’s over within minutes no matter how sheer my application is. I used IT CC cream + IT concealer (super thick) and set it with this rice powder with 0 expectations, and well, I forgot all about it. I got a coffee, made a few long, hysterical phone calls, and even ate 20 blazin’ wings from BWW to only realize in my cars mirror after the fact that my makeup WAS STILL FLAWLESS, EVEN IN 95° HEAT!! I did have super super super faint lines in my smile lines but it disappeared the second I tapped it out with my fingers. UGH, Where has this been my whole life? It’s super mattifying and it doesn’t dry your skin! It does smell like flowery/floral something mixed with baby powder scent and it lingers for a very short period. I’m so hooked on this, I’m so glad it so affordable, truly a great product! I highly recommend this to anyone who struggles with similar skin/makeup issues. If i can just find another shade or two lighter, than I would have nothing at all to complain about. Smells amazing and is lightweight on face. The smell is kinda harsh but it's so beautiful on the skin! Doesn't intensify my large pores and dry patches. Made my makeup last longer than normal so definitely recommend it!! This power was just what I was looking for! it does just the job! El paquete llego en buen estado The right shade at the right price. I love the texture of the product. The ordered it in a whim ( the word RICE captured my attention). I will order this again. It is pancake powder. Better to grind your own favourite rice into powder and have it it.",1,4,-3

They changed something years ago and is no longer worth purchasing, sadly. Why they always ruin superior products is beyond me but they lost my business. Haven't found anything yet with the kind of coverage that this product used to have. I use to love this concealer, but something has changed. There is barely any product in this tube and it doesn’t roll up to produce anymore. It came with product below the rim. For $15?! It’s robbery! Don’t waste your time or money. This coverup is absolutely awesome at providing great coverage. I’ve tried many different ones and this is by far the best! I love love love this stuff. I have never found anything to work so well. It blends nicely, stays on all day, and provides a nice universal tone. It also lasts forever. My only complaint is that despite ordering the lightest shade both times, the product I received the 2nd time was noticeably darker. While its too dark to use under my eyes it still works well to even the skin tone on other parts of my face. I will try ordering one more time in the hopes that I can get a hold of the same lighter shade I originally purchased. Well it works ok but so does the one I got from the dollar store ! I'm 21 years old and I've had dark circles my whole life-- they're heriditary. I have never able to find a concealer to hide them, so I was really excited when I read the reviews for this stuff. I have medium/tan skin, so I ordered the ""light"" (as it was recommended to order a shade lighter than your skin for dark circles) and it's actually still too dark. The ""light"" isn't as light as I thought it would be and doesn't cover my circles very well. I'm kind of disappointed that I paid $13 for a ""miracle"" that doesn't really work for me.. I have a couple brown spots -- like a small, really dark freckle, not a larger more spread age spot -- on my fair skin on my face. Had them forever and whenever I get photographed, usually the photographer gets rid of them in the photo. I thought it was time I cover them before the next photography session ;)It worked beautifully! I dabbed a little on, smoothed it in, did my usual brush of a light mineral makeup and it blended well. If you get up close, you can see a little bit but not much at all.Plus, it's cruelty-free which is why I finally took the plunge and bought it. Glad I did! This really works for my sun spots. I use sunscreen first and it makes the right texture for this consealer.",5,3,2

My face looks good; after I apply it, my skin looks healthy. My pore shrinks in size. I’m a combination-normal and a bit oily on the T-zone. Photo one no primary or make up just cleanser and toner. Photo 2 primary, skin moisturizer and daytime make up. I read this was a good product from another site but when I have used it the product doesn't seem to do anything to make my face look any better from my makeup or stay on better.  Maybe I don't understand what's it supposed to do though. I've used a lot of makeup primers... among a few are: Philosphy's The Present, Smashbox (two different kinds), and Monistat Anti-Chafing gel, which several makeup artists swear by as an off-label primer. Philosphy's The Present was good but it contains lavender, which is not good in regards to creating sun-sensitivity (will give you spots!), the Smashbox left my 40-ish skin looking dry and, ""ewww, where the hell did those pores and wrinkles come from?"" The Monistat was impressive at first, until I broke out in painful, deep bumps.I've been using this for about three weeks now and I LOVE it!!! This is, by far, the best primer I've ever used. It goes on as silky as most primers do since they contain silicone, but the differences between the Reviva and all the others are:1. It sets up pretty quickly. I'm ready to apply my cream foundation a bit sooner than I was with the other brands.2. It never balls up, even if I use a bit more than I meant to.3. It ACTUALLY smooths out fine lines and the appearance of pores.4. Most importantly to me... six hours later my makeup still looks great, my pores are still diminished, the fine lines are still hidden or plumped or filled. I don't care what you want to call it... I don't see them!5. My sensitive, acne-prone skin likes it.6. As soon as I start blending it over my face, it just morphs from the gel consistency into a satin finish.I've been converted from using higher-end brands that cost three times as much as the Reviva and use all sorts of bad ingredients... no matter the percentage or how some manufacture's want to spin the ""preservatives"" that are known to be carcinogenic at the very least, I still want to avoid and eliminate as much as I can of the parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. I've also been using the Oh I do like this product, the way it goes on and feels so silky, and you don't need much. I don't like putting a mixed review because the seller was great and relatively fast, and I generally like Reviva.The downside to this (and all primers that I am aware of), is the first two ingredients, Cycloentasiloxane and dimethicone, are in the silicone family (siloxasanes). The other ingredients are fine (COQ10, olive oil, Vit d, and squalane.I've liked this Reviva line for years, and perhaps there is no way to really make a skin 'primer' without these ingredients? If so we need to figure out how to do without them because nothing is worth your health. We 'girly' type women (or men!) who enjoy products are already subjecting ourselves to so many risks with our personal care products, thus female cancer rates are higher in many instances...so we have to mitigate damage where we can/if we can. (I'm not prepared to go 100% 'natural' and forgo makeup and skin products, so I am always looking for something that is on the benevolent side and still works.)According to Environmental Working Group, (EWG), the most credible guide to chemicals in consumer goods and their human and environmental effects, these first two ingredients are in the ''moderate'' toxic hazard rating, but can bioaccumulate and interrupt with human hormones and fertility, just for starters. Apparently the absorption through the skin can be MORE toxic than consuming similar substances since they go straight into the bloodstream and no digestion as some kind of protection.For some reason I didn't check up on this before I ordered, and ironically my reasoning to use it was to protect my skin from absorbing other potential toxins that may be in my foundation (although I try to use as benevolent ones as I can find).I hope that somehow the olive oil may provide some barrier from absorbing the siloxanes, or that maybe the COQ10 de activates them, but that's probably wishful thinking on my part. While I am giving the PRODUCT  a 5 star rating, i am giving the packaging a 1 star.I love love love this product but I feel cheated.Glides on smoothly I have great skin and small pores but I wear glasses, so make-up and the sweating nose I have mess with my very minimal layer of make-up in that area. So I was applying this only to the area of my face that my glasses sit on to mattify and absorb the moisture throughout the day.  Works like a charm.Now to why I feel cheated. Despite this being at the perfect price point the issue for me was the glass bottle, as the product gets used the pump can only get what it is sitting in so all the product and there is a LOT  left on the inside sides of the bottle that I just cannot get out. For that alone I canno justify repurchase. In a tube you can cut the bottom open and get that product out..with this there is just so much waisted product because it cannot be ""tapped"" on the counter or shaken due to the constiey of the primer. God knows I would see this as my holy grail product because I had used this on bare skin mixing it with a strobe cream and I loved the effect on my skin, so I do know it has great potential.  Sorry guys, change the packaging and I will purchase a lifetime supply.",4,2,2

All will be well and I will almost be convinced....and then comes along the one person with a complaint, and that does it, this one sounded to good to be true, and you know what they say, but I took the plunge and ordered. I was VERY pleasantly suprised!!!It is all it says and more. I am passed middle aged and finding make up that looks natural and helps any flaws (why else do we wear it?)has been increasingly hard to find. Not so with this mascara, here is what it does. Makes lashes that have been curled with a eyelash curler, stayed curled, all day, keeps lashes soft feeling and looking natural, no clumps in sight, and no dull chalky color. it is wonderful. For every day wear, one coat is fine, for going out at night, I will use three to four coats and at the risk of repeating myself, NO clumps in sight, no brittleness, and no spider looking lashes.If there would be one drawback the brush is a little short and fat for my taste, but it's worth it, and makes my lashes look wonderful! Don't hesitate a moment longer order this product!!! OH and did I mention it's waterproof WOW!!!! I thought my friend was wearing eyelash extensions, but she swore by this mascara! Love the formula but hate the thick fat brush. Here's my fool-proof pain-free application method to prevent injuring the eyeball with the chubby brush.1. Curl lashes.2. Instead of brushing the mascara onto lashes, hold the brush steady, close to the eye, and blink furiously.3. Maneuver/move the brush into various angles to get the mascara all over.4. Dab powder to the bottom of my eye underneath my eyelash line, using brush or sponge to prevent tearing, racoon eyes5. (Optional) Apply more mascara focusing on the ends of lashes for longer wispier lashes - traditional method or blinking method. I LOVE this mascara! It curls and lengthens like no other. It doesn't really volumize on its own so I use it as a base mascara and then use a drug store brand volumizing mascara on top to finish it off.  You will most likely need to follow this 2 mascara routine to get the best possible look, but this regimen has given me better results than ANY high end mascara out there, including Diorshow, and it's one of the cheapest mascaras on the market so I can't complain about having to add another layer to get the full effect. It doesn't clump, not even when I add the second layer of mascara, and it's super long-lasting. Lash length and curl stays all day long into the night. This is definitely one of my go-to makeup items so I'm SO glad I stumbled upon it on Amazon. Beautiful length and volume and holds my curl all day! Love this mascara!Only down side is that the product has a weird, sort of toxic smell like motor oil or grease. Not sure if mine is a dud or outdated. The smell is not noticeable once dry, but it does make me wonder...but It works so well that I'll probably continue using it even if it gives me a giant eye tumor.I'll probably repurchase and see if they all have this smell. Overall, very happy with results despite off-putting odor. My beautician used this product to do my makeup for my wedding.  That should tell you something.  Afterward I went back to my old clumpy (and more expensive) brand.  Finally, after trying several brands that were supposedly the best (but they weren't), the light bulb went off, and I remembered Christian.  This mascara really makes my eyelashes look longer.  It stays on all day, and doesn't flake later, plus there is no smearing or smudging.  I thought I wouldn't like the fat brush, but it works extremely well.  I ordered the seven oils black, and am wondering what the other oils will be like.  However, I think I'll stick with what works well. ""Seven oils"" is more a fanciful name than a product description. This is your grandmother's mascara - petrolatum, beeswax, and parabens. At the bottom, it does say the mascara MAY contain several kinds of oil plus iron oxide.The inky black color is nicely saturated. Try not to blink until this dries or it will smear, but once on, it lasts pretty well - again, a lot like the old fashioned kind of mascara. It doesn't lengthen at all but may volumize a little if you put on several coats. Despite the waxy formula, it didn't make my lashes stiff.If you just need color, this is a nice black bargain option. If you need something that will enhance or treat your lashes, I'd say spend the extra money and try elsewhere. This is a nice mascara that I discovered 5 years ago in Hawaii.  I was happy to have found it on Amazon.  However, my joy quickly faded when I used the mascara.  Pros: It is long-wearing, waterproof and will lengthen your lashes and your lashes will get conditioned.  Con: little flakes would form allover my lashes and bits would get into my eyes.  The tube may have dried out a bit when I rec'd it.  But that may be the nature of the beast when it comes to waterproof formulas because that has happened to me with other brands (from high to low end too).  If you have short to medium lashes, you will like this mascara because it ""builds up"" the lashes quickly. This is a very buildable product. You will not get much from one layer. It seems a bit dry and oily but I think it helps so that you don't get gigantic globs and can actually layer it to you liking. It does add length but nothing to get excited about and it's definitely an all day Mascara. Doesn't clump and doesn't run which is a plus for me!",5,2,3

I have this on subscribe and save so I get one every month. So sad that the whole tip broke off and the rest will not come out the 2nd time I used it. It went on incredibly easy and thought it was something great. Maybe I just got a faulty one because it is a nice eyeliner the first time it worked. This has been my go to eyeliner since I started wearing makeup.  I can’t imagine having a pencil that has to be sharpened, this one is perfect Have used this product for years.  Very good! Not sure how this one works yet but I already have and used this product before and I love it. I bought my first one from Ulta beauty and decided to buy one from Amazon as a Christmas gift. When it got it I noticed that the sponge or smug part of the product is a lot smaller on the Amazon bought one. (The Amazon one is the still in the package). I love this to shade in my thinning eyebrows and outer eyelids. However if worn inside upper or lower lids it does smudge. Absolutely garbage!!!Didn't even draw 1/8 of my eye lid before a huge chunk fell out. Do not recommend.Flaked all day off until I could get home to remove iI. Quality isn't there.",1,3,-2

For Washable Definition and Shape in Longer-looking Lashes , 0.22 Fluid Ounce","I had used the Pink/Green Great Lash for years. When it was out of stock I begrudgingly purchased this. OMG!!!! Best mascara ever! It goes on smoothly with no clumps, lasts, doesn’t smear after wearing all day, gives great length! It does run out a bit quicker than my Great Lash, but I will keep using my new favorite mascara. Tip: it’s a little heavy for my total liking so I add a few drops of distilled water to loosen it up and I have a perfect consistency! I love Maybelline mascaras, for me they are one of the best ones. This one is very easy to use, bristles are so light and don't leave lumps what is really great. And the final effect is also amazing, and easy to remove it after a whole day 🙂 This has to be my favorite most affordable mascara. I like that it doesn’t run and smudge under my eyes, it doesn’t clump up and it lasts for a good amount of time. when I buy drugstore mascara the tube usually only lasts about 2-3 weeks and this one lasts atleast 5-7 weeks. I usually buy mac mascara but sometimes I’ll throw this one in the mix to save money because it is so budget friendly. Love this mascara. Easy to take off. Separates better than any other mascaras ive tried. I have used Maybelline define-a-lash for probably 8-10 years now. It's the only mascara I use. I love the applicator, it small and doesn't have the long, bottle-brush bristles that many of the other ones have. I have shorter, curled lashes, so the long bristle brushes just get makeup all over the place and over apply in one coat. Define-a-lash spreads evenly. I also love the control I have. I usually can get the perfect look I want in two coats (letting the first coat dry for a couple of minutes, then applying the second coat.) Highly recommend if you want more control, like natural looking lashes and don't want stuck-together spider legs on your eyes! Love this mascara.  Very light on my lashes. No lumps. Will definitely be buying it again. favorite mascara ever. nothing has ever compared. Very easy to use and stays all day.  Love it",3,5,-2
