0,B000XE1ZI4,"I would buy this again. exfoliates and lathers well. Don't think it actually lasted 20 washes though I loved these! I bought one for each of my friends for stocking stuffers. The scent is refreshing yet not overwhelming, and they are soft. Great product!  The moisturizing part of this product works great. It's the exfoliating part that didn't do anything for my rough feet. Still, I like the product because it helps to wash and moisturize my tootsies without feeling greasy or anything. Good product. I didn't smell anything so I can't comment on the scent. Cleans and softens my feet. It will not remove tough dry skin or callouses. More of a daily use to keep soft feet soft. I like the improvement in my feet. I’ve always had dry feet that accumulate dead skin quickly. This sponge with raw shea butter within weeks has been a game changer. Ty I thought it would be a little firmer , but I misunerstood that is was a like a real sponge.BUT IS SMELLS GREAT. THAT I LOVE !So if u want something firmer get a pumice stone or a rasp.It is a good foot wash..If that is what u want , I recommend this. Truth in packaging? Not! Half the size of the package.  Using in the shower, it's soft, scented and cleansing.  I guess for the price. It's not bad!"
1,B000052X9G,"I’m told that for many people, 2 Nullo a day (1 in the morning and 1 at night) work great to reduce body odors. If you’ve new to Nullo you might find it will work different for you. You might need more or less than the standard 2-a-day. Everybody’s body chemistry is different so you’ve got to be patient and test it out for several weeks. I’ve been using Nullo for years, and I take just 1 pill a day, in the morning. Nullo pretty much eliminates my body orders and any, a-hem, bathroom smells. I do use underarm deodorant every other day. But besides that, it’s just Nullo keeping me non-stinky. If I skip a day, usually because I’ve forgotten to take my pill, I can still get by if I remember to take my pill the next day. I find I start becoming a stinky human after 2 days without the pill. Other people I know who take Nullo will become stinky unless they are very strict about taking 2 pills a day. So if you decide to try Nullo out, bemindful of 2 things: 1-Expiriment with the dosage as you give the product a few weeks to work and, 2-It will turn your pooh green. I ordered Devron and nullo. Long story but nullo was delivered elsewhere because we were going to be on vacation when it arrived. Devron came right away so I started taking them. I lost the bottle that sat on the table by my bed. I think it got knocked into the trash can. SO, I started on the nullo. It made me sick but it took several days for me to realize what was causing the upset stomach. I stopped nullo & within 48 hrs, my upset stomach was gone. I had a few Devron in my pill keeper so I've taken them & just ordered another bottle of Devron.The difference in the two pills is Devron are light colored capsules. nullo are dark brown caplets & the dosage says 2 daily. I followed directions. Devron recommends 1 or 2 capsules 2  times per day. I took 2 in the am and 2 at night. It never upset my stomach. Warning: If you've never taken nullo or Devron ~ it changed the color of your stools drastically so don't let it alarm you. I have very strong underarm odor and even with strongest deoderant/antiperspirant available on the market, they seem to offer no solution to my embarassing problem.  Lately,  I have discovered that chlorophyll works for me to eliminate my offensive smell.  I was using another chlorophyll brand supplement which worked very well until I ran out and used nullo as a backup until I could get more ordered. I started taking Nullo and on the second or third day I noticed the oder subsided completely. This stuff works! However, It does turn your stool green. Also, I found that I had to take the pills with food or I would get stomach cramps taking it on an empty stomach. I did fine on 3 tablets per day (about every 2-3 days), for 300-lbs bodyweight. The chlorophyll must be given time to spread through the entire digestive tract, turning all content green. It does suppress most of the fumes, especially the unpleasant ones.You will still have some flatulence, but it should not drive people from the room. (Broccoli clusters should be microwaved about 30-seconds, before consumption, do decrease their bacterial activity in the gut.)A week or so after you stop taking Nullo, your flatulent odors should return with seemingly more volume and heavier odors. (But that experience is subjective, since you have gone a time with very little volume & odor.)(Magnesium supplementation will help your bowels move, if you are prone to constipation. The magnesium allows your system to leave more fluid in the fecal matter, allowing normal elimination. If you take too much, however, you will do like Cartman, in the WoW episode.) I finally found something that eliminates the smell I am otherwise unable to get rid of by any other means, and believe me I've tried EVERYTHING!!  I feel more confident being around others and by watching their reactions it works.  Before Nullo most if not all people would gasp in horror wondering who farted or quietly hold their breathe hoping for fresh air.  I can't explain why I was suddenly struck with this horrible problem, but I can tell you Nullo has made dealing with it much easier and I am not ashamed to go in public anymore.  I wish I would have found this product years ago  instead of suffering in silence and causing others to suffer from the stench.Thank You Nullo! While the product readily reduced the odor of flatulence and BM's to basically nil, I did not purchase it for that purpose. It's active ingredient has been shown to address multiple GI issues, a few of which I have had into my 30's. After roughly 4 days of 1/2 pill with breakfast I am experiencing a solid, regular stool, less (TMI apologies) leakage, and eradication of diarrhea, all with no change in diet. My wife has had similar results as well. Can't recommend enough. This worked pretty nicely but you do have to take it for at least a couple of days before seeing a noticeable effect.  Tablets are tiny and easy to swallow with water.  I found that one tablet a day wasn't enough, so I went to two, which upset my stomach pretty badly.  That's still an improvement over some other brands, where I can't even take one without ill effects.  So now I break these in half (they have a line down the middle and snap easily) and take anywhere from a half tablet to two whole tablets, depending on what I've been eating (garlic, onions, etc), how sensitive my stomach feels, and how many days I've skipped taking it. My son has had problems with body odor from the time he reached puberty.  It doesn't make any difference how many showers he takes in a day.... it is still a problem.  After extensive research on his situation, I believe my son has (by my own diagnosis) what is known as ""trimethylaminuria"", a metabolic disorder.  Just recently I discovered this product and sent it to my son who lives out of state.  After taking Nullo as directed he says he cannot believe how well it works.  Most days he takes only one and some days he takes two (I believe due to his diet).  All I can say is thank you Nullo for helping my son lead a normal life!"
2,B000TUC9AA,"Hubby got this for shower use. He says its a little awkward but he adapted. (We are in an RV and he has a shoulder issue which may be contributing factors) No complaints on the scrubbiness or size. Wish they had model with a longer handle, maybe 22-24 inch long for my use, other than that is the best back brush I have ever had ,  thank you This bath brush will reach down your back, better than any other. I have purchased many that claim to be long. This brush blows them all away. Trust me, Swissco is the best! The brush is well made, but a bit stiffer than I like. I am going to try putting a wash cloth over the bristles when I see use it again.  The handle is a good length. So, what's missing in modern society today is a real back brush for the shower.  This one comes close.If you are looking for a soft brush to caresse the perfumed lotion off of your skin, or to get the beauty powder off of your nether-region, look elsewhere.  If you want a stiff brush for scraping the barnacles off of your back you've come to the right place.  This is a good brush for showering after you've toiled in the fields, or pumped iron all day.It has stiff plastic bristles for some good friction, a nice, big, solid brush head to remove debris and toughen your skin into elephant hide.For some reason, they paired it with a long, thin sloping handle (-1 star).  The handle is too dainty for this brush head.  You can't get the necessary skin-peeling force with a long, thin handle.  It really should have a 2 inch wide by 1 inch deep, hearty handle.  It does have a nice reach though.Overall I expect to break it in over 2 years to get the bristles about right.  Since I won't be pounding railroad ties with it, I expect the handle will hold up.  I'll still be on the lookout for a vintage brush, but for a new one, this is as close as I've found so far.  I got the clear version too, for the other bathroom. The brush is not as stiff as I had hoped but it's good enough. This is my second brush.  My first is still PERFECT after over 3 years but I like to use the brush for my body not just my back and the long handle makes that hard.  I bought this one, cut off the handle and now use it as a body brush in the shower.  The bristles are maybe a bit too rough for some but I like it and they just don't wear out.  SUPER WELL MADE! Should have rubber on handle. Slippery when wet and soapy.."
3,B000MZX6QI,"I absolutely loved this scrub, I was actually hesitating on whether to buy this since nobody else i knew bought it but it was worth it. I usually throw away or end up washing and then boiling my wash clothes to get rid of bacteria but this one has little holes and cleans so well. I do however pop it in the washer sometimes but never the drier. If your thinking about buying this, then do it before you regret. This all has to do with if you want to really scrub yourself.  If you push hard with this it will feel like you are scrubbing with 80 grit sandpaper.  It is long, good for getting to the back, but not great when you are trying to do legs and arms.  Just fold it double or triple.  I like to put a sliver or sometimes the whole bar, in between the layers while I scrub so I get lots of bubbles.  But all you really have to do is make the material all wet first then rub lots of soap on the middle.Give it a few tries, you will get the hang of it.  I wouldn't use it on my face though.  No mater how lightly you push it's still too rough. Needed something harder than a rag but this was too hard for everyday use.Perfect if you need the occasional exfoliation but I needed something at least 25% softer on my skin. The texture and material are a bit abrasive a first but you eventually adapt. It won't strip your skin and draw blood but it might be jarring if you're used to fabric washcloths. You'll definitely feel like you've been thoroughly exfoliated. In my time using it I definitely feel that my shoulders, elbows and knees have become smoother.It holds a lather pretty well when you bunch it up in your fist like a loofa. When stretched out flat, it holds enough of a lather to run across your back and shoulders.I can leave it hung up like a towel after I shower in the morning and it will be dry by the time I use it again in the evening, even in a humid bathroom. It travels well as you can pack it into small pockets or fold it down to lie flatter than any towel. It rinses so well that I haven't needed to run it through the washing machine, yet. Love this product. Now I can scrub my back myself. Absolutely loved this cloth! We’ve had it a few weeks now and it hasn’t gotten that funky wet rag smell. My husband uses it and says he loves that it doesn’t stretch and the roughness exfoliates great! Will totally keep buying it to replace it every other month. I love this wash cloth.  It works so well for making your skin super soft and smooth.  The cloth is pretty rough so if you are super sensitive to scratching you will probably hate it but the texture makes it great for exfoliating.  It is the size of a large hand towel which makes it great for stretching across your back to scrub it (I'm a larger woman (sz28) so it's good for almost everyone) or you could make a loofah or multiple cloths out of it.  I use it one my face also, I barely brush it against my face when I do though because of how rough it is but that is all you need and your face is as soft and smooth as when you were a kid. I started using this in around 1975 in Japan(Nishi-Ogikubo, Tokyo). I have used other look-alikes but nothing replaces it. It was easy to spot what people are using in Sentou(neighborhood bath house), even back then the bright colored wash cloth was very popular, so I went out to get one myself.I have not used this new one yet, so the star rating is for the Salex I have used in the past.(See my photos in the gallery)The material has changed, so did the package. The lady on the front used to have her hair up. I have seen imitations used exact the same photo on their package, that maybe the reason they changed the lady.What set Salux apart from others, other products may have one or some of the characteristics but not all in one,* Invigorating* Generates lots of suds(saves soap)* Long lasting(nearly life time if you don't mind using bad looking ones)* Very hygienic, rinses easily and dries quickly.* Light weight, you won't mind packing it when you are traveling.* You don't have any body part you can't reach and wash with this(as long as it's outside of the body, in case you are wondering)...I see many reviewers got a wrong product from some sellers. They should post the names of those dishonest sellers as well as good ones.I got mine from M.V. Trading Co. and as far as I can see, it's a genuine Salux."
4,B001ECQ5FC,"This is my favorite deodorant and I would have absolutely no complaints if I had known when I ordered this product that the scent I had wanted was on back order. Not knowing that, I ended up having to change my order at the last minute(the last date it was supposed to ship, I was made aware) to a scent that, while it smells good, is not what I wanted or even my second choice in scents that Dove carries.Other than that, I have no complaints. I can't begin to describe how much I love this product. I am a pretty athletic woman, regularly working out, hiking, and taking the dog on long walks. I also work as a Physical Therapist Assistant, so my typical day involves me running around with my pediatric kiddos and performing higher intensity strengthening workouts with my adults patients. Needless to say, I sweat a lot. I had been using Dove Ultimate go fresh Cool Essentials antiperspirant for YEARS, when suddenly it disappeared on drugstore shelves everywhere. I was so disappointed. I have tried so many different drugstore deodorants/antiperspirants (Degree, Secret, Suave, SpeedStick, etc.), and none of them seemed to do the job. I even went the natural route and purchased the Native brand deodorant. I loved the light smell of Native, but after two weeks of routinely using it I got so sick and tired of being self-conscious of my smell, when I never had a problem with stinky pits before. Not to mention, Native left horrible chalk-like stains on my clothes, and some of those stains never came out. I am a regular shopper on Amazon, and after all of my failed attempts with antiperspirants, I figured, ""what the hell, I guess I'll check and see if Amazon carries it."" BINGO!! I bought the 4-pack and it has not let me down. I only have to apply it once a day and my armpits stay clean smelling and dry. No need to apply a ton of strokes (I typically use 3), otherwise it leaves a little bit of white residue. Either way, the residue is nothing like the kind from the others I had listed above. I hope I can continue to purchase this deodorant on Amazon, because the Dove Advanced Care version of this deodorant is just not the same. As long as they keep making it, I'll continue to buy it. This is great stuff...enough said! This is not regular Dove Gofresh (pictured is the older style which we thoughtwe were ordering).  This is the Dove Advanced Care version.  I'm keeping it because the picture inside the listing does show Advanced Care,  works fine for me (but not fo my husband for whom the older version works great).This isn't so much of a problem with the seller (other than they need to update the listing photo, but the mistakewas mine), but just to advise buyers to be aware that this is the Advanced Care version. Without the use of this anti-perspirant/deodorant, my wife would probably smell bad AND have sweaty armpits... Which possibly could result in our marriage crumbling... Which would eventually lead me to start dating again... Which would lead to me having to shell out a bunch of money for a new sports car along with fancy and exotic dinners with women I hardly know. I would have to pretend to like their weird friends and crazy family. I would have to deal with my kids acting up because they don't want a new ""mommy."" By now the divorce settlement had been finalized. Now I'm broke, my awesome sports car gets repossessed, my girlfriend leaves me because I was a lot more fun when I spent my money frivolously, but now I have some serious alimony and child support payments... I have to explain to the kids that ""mommy #2"" is gone... Now they hate me...  My life is in a downward spiral........ All because I didn't dish out a couple of bucks for some simple hygiene products. Do yourself and your significant other a favor and buy this anti-perspirant/deodorant and save yourself money, years of regret and heartache... I should also mention that this Cucumber and Melon Dove has a very pleasant scent and actually works well to keep my wife's armpits dry during the day. I not only recommend this product, I insist on it. BEWARE! Received a completely different item that was listed! An 8-pack of tiny ones instead of a 4-pack of the size listed and they are all labeled NEW FORMULA instead of what's shown in the picture. I specifically was looking for the old version of this deodorant. Also ""MADE IN RUSSIA"" and looks totally different from the deodorant I currently have. Doesn't even list the size.What a scam! I bought this based on the good reviews from other users and because I love the smell of the other Dove products in the cucumber scent. I figured it would smell nice and work like any other deodorant or anti-perspirant on the market, no big deal. It works BETTER than any other product I've used before and it smells fantastic! No greasy feeling when you apply it, no marks at all on your clothes after you apply it, it goes on dry and stays that way. Even in the high humidity and heat of east Texas combined with a day full of chasing dogs and horses around I did not find I had to reapply three or fours into my day. By the end of my day, I still felt and smelled fresh and clean. The Dove does cost more than other brands which at first glance is a negative, but then again in the long run I'm using less of it so it's a wash. (pun intended.) I've been using this deodorant for 2 years now. I am a person that shops by smell when buying deodorant, so other features don't matter much to me. I first got a small sample of this deodorant and brought it along on my vacation. I came back associating my vacation with the smell of this deodorant. It smells amazing and reading the other reviews here, I felt compelled to write my bit in agreement. When I put this deodorant on, I feel like it would last until the end of the day. I would never have to worry about re-application (""24 hour protection""). It gives you confidence and makes you feel good knowing that you smell great, not to mention that it is composed of 1/4 translucent moisturizer (""smoother underarms in 5 days. go sleeveless!"")."
5,B0006FMKB6,"My dermatologist recommended this bath oil to me because I have dry, sensitive skin and don’t usually like using moisturizer because of after effect of greasiness or heavy feeling on my skin. I also typically don’t use oils in the shower due to the slipperiness of the shower floor once the excess moisturizer is rinsed off before exiting shower, but RoBathol is different! It gives me a nice moisturized feeling without excess heaviness, and does Not make my shower floor slippery after use! It is made from cottonseed oil, is unscented so safe for my sensitive skin, and does the job it’s supposed to without all the extra stuff. I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin and who hates the feeling of heavy cream or oily moisturizers. Love this bath oil for eczema. Its super calming and moisturizing. A little bit goes a long way. When I say we’ve tried EVERYTHING on the market for eczema relief I mean everything. This  was a gaaaaame changer for us! His outbreaks are very minor now and usually go away overnight with a good bath with this in it! I Moved up north after living in Florida for 60 years. My beautiful dry skin took a beating for two years before I discovered this bath oil.The smell isn't that bad, for us extra sensitive people, and it really stops me from scratching until I'm bloody.Yes, it's oily in the tub, however my skin loves it. A doctor told me about it. There wasn't anything they prescribed to stop the itch! This did.  I hope if you try it, it will work for you, as well, as it did me! I 💃🏿 Bought this as my dermatologist recommended it. Use it at night after showers. Product seems to help my eczema/dry skin. I only use it once a day, but my skin is not as red and is smoother. Doesn’t really have a scent that I notice. It does take a little bit to “soak” in so you may have to wait to change clothes, go to bed, etc to prevent getting the oil on something. I will be buying again. Love it. I have suffered from Atopical Dermatitis for 3 years on my face and Body! Vanicream simply makes the best soothing products for skin! Trust me I have tried Truly expensive everything out there to get rid of this. Vanicream Thank you! Actually getting ready to buy another bottle to have in! This truly works miracles! I put some of the oil on around my hairline daily and wow it worked! Thank you Thank you! I absolutely love this bath oil for moisturizing my skin. In the winter especially my skin is so dry, flaky and itchy! This takes care of it all!!! I used to be able to get it at my local pharmacies but not anymore. I have to order it online. Best bath oil ever!!!!!"
6,B000EZOC1O,"Exactly what I ordered and works as expected.  Cleans, smooths and gently exfoliates. Very easy to clean, too. This long cloth can exfoliate everywhere. I do dry exfoliating before my shower then use it with soap (or without) in the shower. Great for my back and legs with two hands and for my upper arms with one hand. I get hairs in my legs that grow straight under the skin. I have to flick them out with a pin or else I end up picking at them with my fingernails and creating bumps. Someone recommended this cloth, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to help the issue. However, I've kept using the cloth every time I shower because it feels good! I was afraid it would irritate the sensitive skin on my legs because it feels very rough, but it actually seems to be helping them be less dry and itchy. I do wish the tag was a loop so I could hang it up securely on my door hooks, but it dries really fast so I don't have to leave it hanging up for very long. Washing with a bar of soap alone always leaves me feeling a bit grimy. No matter how much I rinse, it doesn't really exfoliate dead skin cells, etc. A mesh pouf is ok for exfoliating but 1) you can't scrub your back 2) They fall apart WAY too easily 3) to get a good scrub (as opposed to just lathering your body) you have to hold the pouf in a tight bundle and rub it against your skin 4) it's not really good for scrubbing your face.I came across this washcloth when I was buying a showerhead, it was one of those ""people who bought this, also bought that"" kind of ads. Seeing 4+ star reviews despite hundreds of reviews, it sounded like it was worth checking out. So I clicked, I read, I was still confused. ""It's just a nylon cloth,"" I thought, ""right?"" It claimed to have won some kind of invention award but didn't say what award and that made me suspicious. Anyway, I ordered it since it was cheap and if it did what it claimed it would be worth it.THIS THING WAY EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. As hard as it was for me to understand the other reviews, it will be hard for me to explain but I'll try... It's great at exfoliating but not abrasive (won't leave your skin red and raw like a cloth washcloth). It's long enough to soap up and get your back (probably the first time since I was a kid that I had a good back scrub in a strictly bathing situation). It won't fall apart like a pouf. It's a lot easier to rinse and get the soap out than a pouf so you won't get bacteria. It doesn't hold water when rinsed like a cloth so you won't have to wait for it to dry--in other words, it's good to go if your hubby or someone else wants to shower right after you. Finally: It's great for your face--gentle but effective. Your face will feel SQUEAKY CLEAN after you're done. All the makeup, blackheads, whiteheads, skin bumps, and dead skin will be washed away but you won't be sore or re-faced. I SWEAR you will be feeling your skin after you're done the first time using it saying, ""wow, that's so smooth!""Are you getting the idea? I don't know if this REALLY won an invention award but it should have. This is a must have for anyone who showers, woman or man (my boyfriend loves it too). This is what I've been waiting for my entire life!.. Which is a very dramatic thing to say for a wash cloth, but it's honestly how I feel; I could preach the greatness of this product for the rest of my days the way some people preach about their religion, it's that good:) I even bought some to give to my sisters and they love it too.With your conventional plastic loofahs, the ones that come at the end of a bamboo brush, even the fancy natural ones that grow on trees, they're just not effective. I always had residual dead skin that wouldn't wash off but I would see on my legs later after I was done drying myself off. I would then spend more time just scrubbing myself in the shower and getting annoyed at the extra time and effort it was taking to really get myself squeaky clean sometimes with very little effectiveness... and I don't have any skin conditions. My skin's actually pretty nice. Now it's even nicer with this! I fold up the cloth so it fits in my hand, douse it with some fancy castle soap and scrub away. I now spend less time in the shower now and my skin feels so dang smooth when I get out.. I absolutely love it. I also read somewhere that this won an invention of the year award (or something like that) in Japan and I can totally understand why.I've been using this product for over 6 months and the only thing is that the edges are starting to fray a little bit.  2 ends are sewn up but the 2 long edges are not.  If I had a sewing machine I would do this myself but so far it's still just as effective to use as day 1, not to mention that I bought this in a pack of 3 so this will last me a while.Another bonus is that it's super easy to pack on trips because it takes up such little space. I swear by those scrubbies that are made of a similar material.  they do a great job of exfoliating and you only need a relatively small amount of bath gel with them.  This product, however, gets that part of the back that just can't be reached with your hand and it does it better than any brush that I have ever tried. I have problems with my shoulders and I can't reach back and around like I need to to wash my back.  Even when using brushes I can't seem to get the leverage to scrub like I want to.  I tried these and I am thrilled!  I wet them, fold them, apply the body gel and squish it into the material.  I then open it up and I scrub my back with it by holding it like a towel when I dry my back.  There is no torquing of my shoulder and it takes no strength at all.  Plus I get a semi massage that feel wonderful!  I gave my neighbor one of these and she absolutely LOVES it!  She is disabled and has a hard time with her shoulders and strength and this does the trick for her as well.  It is more abrasive than those scrubbies but common sense will dictate how you use them. The only thing that I have found is that the gel washes out of the product VERY quickly when the shower water hits it so unless you want to scrape the skin off your body and/or wash with hardly any soap try to use this away fro the shower stream.  On the other hand, they rise out very well! Enjoy!"
7,B000052YJC,"I have used exfoliating facial sponges for years.  I find that my fairly sensitive skin tolerates them much better than harsh chemicals or peels.  My face always feels super clean after use, with the day's grime, makeup and dead skin cells massaged away.I usually use an off label brand but unable to find any, I decided to give this Buff Puff brand a try, despite the higher price tag.The quality of the sponge is great.  It kept its shape for quite some time, lathered wonderfully, and performed as expected.  Lasts longer too, so might even justify the higher cost.  It was just too 'gentle' for me.  For reference I'm a 50+ female.  I will give the 'regular' type a try next time. I have very dry skin and in the winter, it is even dryer. This body buff puff is great for ridding yourself of dry flaky skin! I love these sponges so much. They exfoliate without being too much, yet you can feel it scrubbing still.  Which I like to feel it, I know iits working that way lol I love this buff puff. I use it with a charcoal cleanser on my face daily, and it lasts a good amount of time. The price is pretty good too. There disposable, which I like, though they last way longer then you’re store bought puffs! I have dry skin and prefer to use liquid body wash rather than a bar of soap when I shower. This bath scrub goes perfectly with that as you can use a small amount of body wash and it stays on the surface rather than soaking into a loofah or the bristles of a scrub brush. The exfoliation you get with this scrub is perfect-removes the top layer of dead skin cells (I know...yuck...but truth) without feeling like you are sanding the skin. It is the perfect size to fit in one hand without slipping and it easily rinses out after use. I replace these every month (yay for Subscribe & Save pricing) but you could probably go longer, if needed. I've been using these daily for at least 2-3 years and still give them 5 stars. I love the way it has 2 different sides.  It makes my skin very soft. I would be lost without my Buff Puff, more so for my arms and legs than anything else, but I do very gently use it on my face in a slow circular motion about once a week with a good facial cleanser that suds up to clean and smooth my skin, as well as Biore Pore strips as needed.  The combination really works wonders and makeup goes on so much better. I have always believed It is so important for a woman to use good products from an early age, gently cleaning and moisturizing as a daily lifelong routine."
8,B000I20Q72,"I purchased this scrubber as I felt my back was not as smooth as the rest of my body. This easy-to-use scrubber has made a difference just in the first few uses.  I've had no issues at all with it bunching up of not smoothly going across my skin on the chosen side.  I rinse it well and air dry for a couple of days in between uses.  Great product! Just the right length the right abrasion easy to use, it feels great. It works very well except that it bunches up together sometimes. Works great for my backne! Easy to use , works as it should , reaches hard to get places . I’d buy it again I honestly didn't think I would use this much but now I love it. Good for back or use to scrub feet without having to bend down I actually got this for shoulder range of motion because I have two artificial shoulder joints.  It's perfect, the ""handles"" make it easy to use, much better than the rolled towel the therapist used.  Great for scrubber your back, too! As advertised; nice exfoliating 😊"
9,B000RTDUOW,"Man this powder is very reasonable and expensive and it smells so good, for all the large breasted females you understand that in the summer and even in the colder months because your breast is Big you have a sweaty smell like sweat socks in your bra, I could not tolerate this any longer this product definitely help with the smell I purchase some soap and it help with the skin infection. I know this may sound odd...but some women can get an itchy rash under their breast from sweat. This will solve your problem forever.....never anymore rash!  I have been using this for years and it works for this purpose 100 percent. I can’t believe how silky smooth this stuff makes my skin! And no more chafing between the thighs!! The smell is pleasant and not overpowering. I work 12 hour shifts at a hospital and this keeps things fresh all night! I only use it when needed since doctors recommend that we do not use any of the Powders especially scented. Feels fresh Just as seller described, value for money, great scent, make me feel dry all day. Will surely buy again Very good for sensitive skin. Pleasant feel and smell I use it all over"
10,B00008O2X5,"I've always had sensitive skin but never had a problem with store bought Deodorant until last year. All of a sudden they all gave me a painful rash. Took me forever trying new products to find one that didn't irritate my skin. This one works! No rash since using it. My only 2 problems with it is that I think it smells like tap water (if that makes sense) better than smelling bad. And 2 is that I can't find it in stores so that sucks. Still on the hunt for one that I can find in stores that smells decent or no scent at all. But this will do for now. My favorite deortant. I have very sensitive skin and I don't break out from using this product.I do feel that the package is misleading in size. It looks like you get more but when you look at the inside you will see it is a lot of empty space Not irritating.  Let dry before putting on clothes. I used to use the Kosas roll on deodorant in the green tube for months, it was the best. Then after repurchasing from Sephora, my armpits started getting super itchy, red, and would burn immediately after applying. I think the formula may have changed, but it was so uncomfortable. Then I purchased this and another to see if it would help, and this Almay one gave me immediate relief. A night and day difference.It seems to help with odor, though I’ll find out as time goes on. The anti-perspirant part didn’t matter to me, it was more to get rid of the reaction I had and to control odor. If anything changes, I’ll update my post, especially if my body starts to adjust to it.As others have stated, it can crumble, but I think it depends on how much is applied, at least from trying it out for a few days. I do as thin of a layer as I can and it still works throughout the day. However, I noticed that it does transfer on my black t-shirts that go into my armpit, but I’m not sure if it would for lower armed clothes like tank tops, strapless tops, etc. that are darker. It’s not been an issue for me so far though, so that’s okay.My only concern is that it arrived over half empty. It’s only $3, so it’s not a big deal. A little goes a long way as well, so it’s not like it’s going to run out super fast. It just feels a bit deceiving as the product images show a full stick of deodorant, and I received one that was missing most of its contents.I highly recommend giving it a try if you’ve suffered from some kind of reaction to another deodorant like I have, especially since this is so cheap compared to other brands. It completely helped my skin and, is now allowing my armpits to heal, while still being able to act as a deodorant. Hopefully it continues to work! I am allergic to many deoderants. This one doesnt bother me and stops odor. Good price. I love ittt. There’s no scent which I love because the smell of deodorant usually sticks to my clothes and bothers me. It last so long, there’s no white streaks on my clothing, and it dries so quickly. Instantly become my favorite brand I didn't realize this was a clear deodorant until I received it and usually they don't work for me, but, I was pleasantly surprised by this one...it works rather well, I'll be purchasing again.There is no scent, which was originally off-putting, but, it allows my perfume to be the main character and I like that. I'm not allergic to fragrances, but I don't want my deodorant fragrance to ""fight"" with my perfume.  This deodorant works beautifully.  You do have to be careful to make sure you don't apply too much though.  As a gel, it can get sticky."
11,B000CSDDDG,"Once you try it, you will never go back. I had my doubts but I took a chance to try it and have been completely blown away how well it works. I tell my wife that I have completely new skin every time I get out of the shower.Now I need another one because my wife is jealous of my pro level exfoliator. I really like the length of this product.  It allows the person to have more control when it is used on the back and lower body.  However, it could be better if it was a little softer.  The roughness is a challenge on some skin areas.  Maybe after multiple use, it does get softer.  I guess time and usage will tell. This is one of those products you didn't know you need in your life until you have it. I'll tell you why:--Normally I just use a poof, or a wash cloth- but there is only so far one can comfortably reach. . While I CAN contort my elbow joints to reach the middle of my back, I prefer not to, especially when soap and slick shower floors are involved. I kinda hate the scrubbies with a handle, they really don't reach better than a twisted elbow. I'll take my chances on the latter. And wash cloths are one time uses for me. The thought of their wet bodies dangling from a shower knob, barely drying in time for my next shower grossed me out. So I go through a lot of wash cloths. Loofah/poofs are better, but they are sometimes still damp. Yuck. Which brings me to this glorious piece of material that I recommend to everyone..--This bath cloth is like a good shower poof, except it's flat and long. The netting it tighter and does some serious sudsing up with minimal soap/body wash. It suds up soaps into some serious mega lather.--It rinses real easily, too.--And the BEST?  It dries quickly!! I can hang in up and it just dries within a few hours. I haven't timed it, but it is never even a little damp by next shower. This would be GREAT for travel or camping.--Another thing?  It can reach places easily that a little hand held poof can't. Remember that contorted elbow? totally not used for this anymore.--Do you like skin brushing? It works great for those that like some skin stimulation as this netting material is tighter than a typical poof. Great for getting the circulation going. I love it on my legs.-Speaking of legs; since this material does such a good job at lathering up soap, I find it easier to keep my legs lubed up for shaving. I otherwise go through way too much soap trying to use a washcloth.--Did you buy this cheap little thing and absolutely hate it (how could you??), then cut it up and use it to scrub your bathroom, or wash make up brushes, or exfoliate your feet, or whatever one would use to scrub at something.!!DO NOT use this on your face. You shouldn't be rubbing any material across delicate skin like that, but if you do, please be super gentle.DEFINITELY use a light hand while rubbing it across your skin. Make sure it is wet, make sure you are wet, make sure you have some soap on it. Then proceed to enjoy a lather filled shower experience where you can reach all of your body parts, and know that this material will rinse clean, and dry quickly- certainly in time for your next use.--Anyway, after trying mine for the first time, I want to give one to everyone around me. It is such a simple yet glorious product.I LOVE IT!!Once you try it, you will realize that you needed this in your life. You're welcome 😊 I have purchased multiple back exfoliators to use in the shower. This one has real, oh so soothing, exfoliating power. And it is easy to use without any handles to deal with. I can finally reach my back 🙌Lathers nicely and rinses thoroughly.Better than scrubber brush! I like this better than the nylon loofah I sometimes use.  It rinses out easily which is a big plus.  It also is long enough that I can scrub my back.  It feels so good!  I give it 4 stars because there is no way to hang it easily in the shower.  I ended up cutting off a strip at the hem, re-hemming it, and then using the piece I cut off as a loop and attaching that to it.  I slip the loop over a hook in the shower.  I’m going to buy another. I just got this. I love it so far. Haven't had long enough to comment on durability, but my skin is so soft and I feel so clean after using this. Highly recommend. Much better than a loofah...more hygienic. Nothing I have ever used exfoliates like these do, they’re incredible."
12,B0013EBM22,"It doesn't leave my skin green like I imagined it would. It doesn't leave a ring around my tub, it doesn't smell awful either. It actually looks like little crumbled sea salts that are colored various shades of green. I don't know what exactly I was expecting it to look like, but I was happy it didn't look like seaweed in my tub, lol. It's not a very big bag, & you only need 1/2 a cup for one bath, so I'm guessing one bag will be about 15 or so baths maybe? Not sure just yet, I'm just trying to give you guys an idea of the size of the bag & the amounts of baths you'll get out of it. I can honestly say that I don't necessarily feel anything especially fantastic is going on when I sit in the tub with this, it doesn't make your skin tingle, or anything like that. I guess you'll get a warm fuzzy feeling inside of your head because you know you're doing something good for yourself. So I soak in the tub for a while, wait my 20 minutes, then hop out, pat dry as the directions say, wrap myself in my fuzziest long robe, lay down in bed, & wait another 20 minutes. Again, I don't really know that you get any miracle feelings or sensations. It actually feels like a whole lot of nada, but after the 20 minutes are up, I feel like I've just had lengthy massage at a high end spa. And I don't feel like jumping up & tackling my to-do list, I just feel very relaxed, & just sort of wonderful. I don't really know how it works, or why it does. I know seaweed is great for your skin, & for detoxing. All I really know is that I love it. And I think if you try it, you'll probably love it too. I'm happy I tried this, I will definitely re-buy once I start running low. I really did enjoy soaking in this bath... I noticed that my skin was softer and it was very relaxing.  I like the idea of detoxing and of using something more natural than most of the chemical bubble baths out there.  The smell was not bad either, as I had feared.  When I opened the package I was afraid my bathroom was going to smell like seaweed all night, but that was not the case.  The only problem I had with this is that it does not dissolve very well.  There are little chunks of seaweed that float around and don't make it very aesthetically pleasing.  I chose to ignore that, but also noticed that it was less relaxing as I had hoped because I needed to wash the tub out immediately after bathing in order to rinse away the little pieces of seaweed and get rid of the green water line that formed around the tub each time.  Other than being a little messy, it is very enjoyable and I would recommend it. After reading other reviews, which included complaints about having to clean out all the bits of seaweed from the bathtub, right off I got some cheesecloth and cut off a piece large enough for me to put the seaweed and salt in it and tie it up tightly. After a short time in the bath water, the salt had melted. leaving only the seaweed in the cheesecloth bag. Once I was in the bath, I simply squeezed out the cheesecloth while it was in the water, and all the strained seaweed essence came out--but no leaves. I have had some very relaxing baths this way, and there's no more cleanup necessary than with a normal bath. I like it and will probably buy more when I run out. I used it with a seaweed mask that was fishy smelling so I'm not sure if the bath contributed to that fishy smell yet or not, will probably continue to use both at the same time but it was very refreshing feeling, very detoxifying so I can get past the smell...just best done in private. With the combination of the seaweed bath and mask, it provided the same relaxation and comfort of a spa seaweed wrap, only much cheaper and private. Good idea to rest afterward as it feels like it's still ""working"" so to speak after the bath.I would buy this again. I love how the seaweed turns the bathtub a nice shade of green. It sort of feels like I have been transferred to a spa. The seaweed salt is relaxing and makes my skin feel more firm. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the price/quantity ratio. It is expensive but nice for special treat. I really like this bath salt. I usually mix it with various salts, oils and essential oils to make my own bath salts. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. My one complaint is you have to rinse well after using, or risk having tiny flakes of seaweed stuck to you. I wanted to really like these bathsalts but when I soaked in them it didn't feel like anything special at all.  The salts were unscented (except for a very light seaweed scent) so it didn't have that spa feeling and my skin didn't feel particularily soft afterwards.  The seaweek also leaves a mess in the bathtub since they don't dissolve (used it 3x's so far) so you definitely need to rinse your tub after soaking.  I'll use the rest of the bag but doubt i'll get another. I am a regular bath taker. I love baths, and I love salts. Experimented with an abundant of natural bath salt configurations. But this is one of my favorite. Yes, it leaves a residue of seaweed on the tub. But after I take a bath in this I feel like a friggin' mermaid or magical sea creature- and I don't normally feel like that. Yeah, I normally feel kinda square, but these salts are from another world. Buy them for your loved ones and for you. Amazing!"
13,B000WZRBOQ,"I just discovered an old original bottle of Jean Nate After Bath Splash. After using it I decided I would use it all the time. So I was searching for a place to purchase more. I found it here. After reading some of the reviews I was afraid I had made a mistake. I was anxious for it to arrive so I could compare the 2 ""nose to nose"". The old was a little more floral and the new was a little more citrusy. But when I put the new one on I honestly couldn't tell the difference. So I'm very happy and relieved because I put the 30 oz. bottle on Subscribe & Save!!! Love the fragrance. Bought 2 for my mom and will most likely buy her more as she needs. She has used Jean Nate since I can remember. I only wish it smelled as good on me! Jean Naté is a favorite.  I give it a a gift to some special folks.  It brightens their day every time. I just love Jean Nate,  I always feel fresh and clean when I use it after a shower. It also makes the skin feel silky smooth and soft and you smell wonderful too! Muy buen producto me fascinó su fragancia, muy exquisito . This reminds me of my childhood I loved the smell then & still love it now,smells the same Great stuff, hard to find. Light scent, not too perfumy. Good price. Very happy The bottle I got was too bg"
14,B0001TSWWS,"This works for me and the herbal scent is not too strong. A bit pricey. I've tried probably 10 different brands of natural and safe deodorant, from the odorless ""crystal"" ridiculousness to more mainstream brands like Tom's. So far, none stood up until I found Home Health Herbal Magic. I know every person's pH is different and that it can change in small amounts, so I sometimes chalked other brands failures up to that, but regardless I've never had an issue with Home Health and I have not had to change it since I started using it over 2 years ago. I keep track of how long my products last so I can truly see if I'm paying more in the long run for all natural and Home Health lasts 4 months or longer. I use it every day and even reapply after I go the gym or yoga and have to shower again. I recommend sticking with the Herbal scent as the Jasmine has a very strange smell once applied to the skin. Enjoy!p.s. For the record the Jason brand worked well for me for awhile until my pH changed, and it works well for many of my nutrition clients. Also, Everyman Jack works well for my husband. Trick is to keep trying and don't give up! Eliminating the toxic ingredients that are found in mainstream brands is so important for your health! So i've tried lots of different natural deodorants from the silly ""crystal"" to ""Herban Cowboy"" ( which actually made me smell worse than just not applying anything at all).  Im pretty pleased with this product. I would have to say you may need to apply it once more throughout the day. But if you apply it in the morning before work, you should be good until you get off. As the scent wears off, it will eventually turn into a non-scented formula under your pits. Also when you apply it initially, expect some ""sticky"" feeling but this will subside after you put on clothes. Nonetheless, Im happy I finally found the best natural deodorant on the market that works for me. Highly recommendable. For men, steer away from the jasmine scented version of this brand. The herbal scent seems to work the best for long days with moderate sweating. This isn't just the best natural product, it is the best deodorant I have used.  Living in Las Vegas, I sweat a lot! Summers here are miserable,  but this deodorant keeps me smelling fresh until the end of the day.  It used to be available at a health food store here until they changed ownership.  Was very happy to find it on Amazon, and for a better price.  It also never irritates my sensitive skin like other deodorants I've had to use.  First heard about it from Oprah, and so glad that I decided to give it a try.  Need to stock up on them, since I always miss it when I run out. I’ve been using this product for many years.  I love it.  No chemicals or aluminum that block pores associated with causing breast cancer.  I used to get it at Whole Foods but they stopped carrying it.  Glad to have found it on Amazon.  Life saver. Works well, nice scent, lavender and original. The problem with this deodorant is that there is an older version with the label shown, and a newer version with an updated label and scent. I liked the old scent which is very subtle and the new one is much stronger and tangier. I ordered the same thing twice and got different versions. I don't want to take chances anymore so I'm done. If you like the scent, the product itself is ok. I'm shocked to find this works well for me. I do have to reapply after around eight hours, when it's hot out,but it's a minor inconvenience. It has a very pleasant scent, too. I will keep reordering as long as it's available."
15,B0012F4OPO,"it always the same, it has not been changed I love bubble baths & want great bubbles in there with me.  I tested an almost embarrassingly huge # of bubble bath products- from  v expensive to v reasonable- looking for: 1) good smell, 2) silky feel, and 3) long-lasting bubbles. This is the best one I tried by far. The most critical component is that the bubbles outlast me & that is darn impressive. Please keep these in stock! I have used this bubble bath for years. It is soothing to the skin, and the bubbles stay throughout my 30 minute baths. Works as well as the products I receive as gifts, at 1/3 the cost. Just want to tell everyone to order some of this Village Naturals White Tea Milk Bath.  This is the greatest and I searched everywhere to find it after the place I bought it quit having any and the online place where I found it also has an out of stock notice.  On E-Bay, sellers wanted about twice the $ for this.  I kept searching and to my delight found it here on Amazon.  It is the best ever!!!  The scent is mild and very nice.  It makes lots of bubbles and they last until you get out of the tub.  No bathtub ring and moisturizes too. Just great and the 28 oz bottle lasts a long time!  Can't go wrong with this.  I like Jasmine best; but the Melon is also nice. Nice Scent and good price This milk bath makes my skin feel incredibly soft! It has a very light scent, so if you are sensitive to smells this is perfect for you. I have really sensitive skin and this bath is just really nice and calming. It makes a moderate amount of bubbles. I have used this for so many baths and the price is great! Will definitely order this again. ...I also use the village naturals white tea and jasmine bath salts with the milk bath to give it a little something extra and to keep the scent going a little longer. Its a really nice combination. I love how it made my skin soft and smelling good and I noticed my skin rashes going away. I will definitely buy this product again. I really like the scent way it feels in the water"
16,B001EJOPTS,"I use this in the shower for exfoliating.  It’s perfect as a body sponge. Long lasting!😍Highly recommend it! I’ve been using the Buf-Puf for years! Thank goodness I can purchase this online. I panicked when I stopped seeing it in the stores. Everyone always tells me how soft my skin is. Nothing gets you cleaner. My skin is gently exfoliated everyday. I use the green side all over, except for my face, where I use the softer white side.WONDERFUL Product! Removes dried skin softly without scrubbing hard. This is why it lasts a good 2 1/2 months.A great value. Like so many other reviewers, I have a long and storied history with Buf Puf, probably going back to when they were first introduced.  As a young adult prone to acne at the time, they kept my acne in check better than any topical medication available back then.  Over the years, they've kept my skin smooth and glowing.  A few years back, the local retail supply had pretty much dried up even in the urban and urbane community where I reside.  I believe they fell out of favor with the flood of professional microdermabrasion procedures and newer topical treatments, some of which I've tried.  That said, I can honestly say there is no current product or procedure of which I'm aware that provides better results for dollar spent, and thankfully they are now readily available online.The Buf Body Scrub is the perfect solution for overall exfoliation with its dual surfaces.  The white surface should be gentle enough for all but those with extremely sensitive skin, while the blue surface will tackle the rougher areas such as elbows, knees and feet.  It may take a little time to determine the right amount of pressure to use for your skin type, but your face and body will look and feel much better for the effort.I just did some calculating and determined I've been using Buf Puf for over 40 years now.  I think that qualifies me to speak to their quality and effectiveness. The double-sided Buf Puf is an excellent product but not easy to find. I’ve ordered it from Amazon over the years as it’s readily  available there. With a body wash, it’s easy and effective and lasts a month or longer using it once or twice a week. It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I’ll be crushed if it ever becomes unavailable! Best product i've ever used for this purpose I've been using these for years, and I've never replaced them as often as the package says to do so.  Just be sure to rinse them out after each use.  Once they finally wear out, they are useful for household cleaning. Great to use instead of a washcloth. Dr yes out quickly.  Keeps skin smooth. Long lasting."
17,B000NU2OOM,"Great product! Will NOT purchase again due to the enormous price increase of $20!! I paid 6.99 when ordered in 2021! I don't think this is good for use on the face, it's not gentle enough, but it's good for other areas of the body that need to be exfoliated.  You get a lot for the money. It gets the job done well!  My recommendation is and this what i do...cleanse your face first, next take two or three drops of olive oil (cold pressed) or Avocado oil on pat your face thoroughly, next put the same cleanser you first used now wet the sponge and squeeze out excess water (NOTE: make sure your face is over the sink because the sponge soaks up quite a bit of water and even after you squeezed out the excess water runs out the bottom) Next, softly in a round motion begin to use the sponge...focus more on the dark areas of your face.  If you have textured skin, be extra careful and use your ring finger to apply enough pressure...if you feel the sponge scratching use lighter pressure...the main thing to remember is go light, very light pressure with this sponge.  After you are done rinse your face in warm water, pat dry, use toner, then a moisturizer (dime sized amount) with a drop, one drop of your desired oil (lavender or mint) or use hydrating moisturizer of your choice.  In the morning rinse with warm water...use a sunscreen...and your are set to go.  Adjust or use products your skin loves.  Hope this helps. I use these for my face generally- cutting them in half extends the bang for buck as well! Mixed feelings about these.  I have traditionally used a Buf Puf with glycerin soap to lightly buff the little flakes of skin caused by regular Retin-A use off my skin.  On the one hand, you get twelve of these for approximately the price of one Buf Puf. Gotta love that, right.  These *are* a little more abrasive (courser) than the standard (blue box) Buf Puf, but I don’t think super-significantly rougher. Certainly nothing I couldn’t easily adjust for by just using lighter pressure with it while scrubbing it about my face.  No, that’s not my issue with it.  My issue is that it seems like it’s going to wear out faster than a typical Buf Puf.  How much faster is what I’m unsure of yet.  If you are used to using a Buf Puf, you know that after a number of uses they start to flatten out and bend in the middle, etc.  They are still usable for a quite a while even after this starts to happen, but they do get a little worn looking and feeling with extended use.  So, this product just seems to be degenerating into that condition at a faster rate than my Buf Puf.  On the other hand, there are twelve of them instead of one for the same price.  So, I guess I’m going to work my way through this twelve-count bag and then decide whether to stay with this or go back to Buf Puf.  I’m leaning toward staying with these (again, twelve for the price of one so even if each wears out faster, I’ll probably still get longer use from the bag of them overall as compared to one Buf Puf).  This will be an ongoing experiment as I work my way through the bag. These pads are the perfect scrubbing consistency for me.  Before I gave up gluten - which in doing so miraculously restored my skin and cleared up the REALLY BAD dermatitis I had around my nose, lips, and between my eyebrows - these were my savior in helping to slough off flaky skin and let me leave the house.I still use them too - although not as religiously as I just don't need to anymore.  I used to apply Baobab oil to the affected areas, let it soak a bit, then take a dry puff - you heard right - DRY - and rub and slough off the flaky dry red skin.  Then I would be able to put on moisturizer and make-up and go about my day.I still use them dry with baobab oil to now much more gently scrub my face leaving it smooth and silky.Plus - once they get soft and sort of oily from my routine (takes a while actually) - I throw them in the washing machine with some towels and they come out much less firm but then turn into the perfect soft consistency to use to cleanse my entire face.  They pull double duty for me in this way and last me forever! Can’t use on face, pretty rough It works as expected. Not suitable for people with sensitive skin, especially before you break it in. Works great for everyday deep cleansing."
18,B000HGFGKG,"I’ve been using these for a YEARS/decades. You won’t find better gloves. I wash them regularly and while they don’t retain their beauty, they maintain their usefulness.The older gloves were a little bit better quality than this version (which has been around for years now) but these are still 5 stars.The one problem (not at all a dealbreaker) is that every pair I’ve owned has had one of the loops fall off on one glove only. Every. Single. Pair.Highly recommended. Love these, glad to find themOn Amazon Great exfoliating gloves but there are softer than I was expecting them to be. I like my exfoliating gloves to be more corse but if you are looking for a gentle skin exfoliating glove this is for you. If you like gloves to sandpaper the first layer of your skin off like me- maybe pass LOL I put a bar of soap inside this mitt and I use it for scrubbing when I am in the shower. This keeps the shower soap from falling down and creating a danger for me when I try and bend down to pick it up. I shower alone so safety is the only requirement for me. Gloves fit my small hands well even with acrylic nails on. They have a little roughness to them but doesn’t scratch my skin. It feels good overall. These gloves are too small for my hands which hasn’t been an issue for me with other gloves. There also isn’t anything to hang your gloves from like a little loop which I didn’t even think to look for when purchasing.I’ll try using them for a while, but kind of annoying. Bought this for a friend and she loves them. Getting more for myself and other friends. This was my first time purchasing them off of Amazon bc it’s literally the only thing I buy from the Body Shop these days and I wanted that free Prime shipping. Well, I’m disappointed and I’m hoping that this is just bad stock.The gloves are not as coarse as they used to be and as many others have mentioned, they no longer have a loop to allow you to hang them easily.They are only a touch better than the ones you get at dollar tree or Target but don’t hold a candle to the ones the Body shop sold in 2020. I bought a few back then and finally had gotten rid of my last pair. Now I’m wishing I would’ve held out until I found a suitable replacment because these are not it!"
19,B001ECQ4RG,"I don’t use a lot of make up but I use this cold creamer a little eye liner lipstick and I am out the door.Love this product my mother and grandmother both used it. That you could get a 3 pack I’ve been using this for 40 years to take off my makeup I’m 60 with hardly any wrinklesThis is a great price for 3 9oz! I have tried many, many different types of cleansing and make-up removing creams, gels, liquids, foams and oils.  Despite this, I have never come across anything as effective and gentle as Pond's Cold Cream...This stuff was invented in the late 1800s and probably was in every household by the early 1900s...  I remember as a child my grandmother always had it on her dressing table...  I've used it on and off for most of my life (currently late forties)...  And yet, I am always looking for something better, the new-and-improved, a completely natural alternative or the latest innovation out there because it's in my nature...Look at the label and you'll see many ingredients that are less than ideal such as mineral oil, beeswax, carbomer, ceresin, acetyl alcohol, et cetera...  Things that must surely clog pores or cause rashes and issues for my sensitive skin...  And yet......somehow it doesn't.  It does not cause me to break out or get rashy even when I use it every day... EVEN when I used it when I was a teenager.  How is that possible?  I have no Idea, but it's true.I've tried the ""Burt's Bees"" cold cream but besides the comparatively high price tag, the texture is too thick and waxy and leaves my skin feeling stripped and dry.  The texture is also NOT conducive to removing eye make-up without much manual rubbing which is round on my eye lashes and delicate eye skin...I've tried the ""Noxzema Deep Cleansing Cream Plus Moisturizer"" but it burns my eyes so bad, I dread using it and I don't want cleaning my face to involve many steps and products, vis-a-vis a eye make-up remover before I cleanse my face with the Noxzema and rinse my face with water and on and on... Ponds doesn't require a running water rinse...So I keep coming back to this ridiculously simple, super cheap, easily found basic solution...When I get home from work I put up my hair or otherwise pull it back and put a huge doll of Ponds on my dry face with clean hands and rub it all over my face, neck and chest.  It feels nice and removes every trace of make-up and grime including waterproof mascara and eyeliner with no effort.  If it gets in my eyes as it often does, there is no irritation what-so-ever although if I'm wearing my contacts, it gets a little blurry...  In the past I've just wiped it off with a dry soft cloth which works fine but recently found out a much better way is to use a warm damp cloth instead...  Specifically I use, ""Plush MojaFiber Microfiber Face Cloth: Ultra Dense 3 Pk - 12""x12"" which I also bought on Amazon and LOVE!  This little routine feels really nice, very relaxing...  It leaves me skin so soft and so clean and moisturized but not greasy.  Then, given my face tends to be on the dry side, I put on a moisturizer...  If I wash my face again in the shower I take before I go to bed, well it feels like overkill and bothers my sensitive skin so I just wash the rest of me and go to bed.The nicest thing about this product is it's versatility...It functions as both make-up remover and cleanser and in a pinch, moisturizer as well with no break outs or irritation...although if your skin is oily or combination, using it as a moisturizer may feel greasy for you.When I go camping it's amazing as a one step product before I go to bed, no rinsing needed, just wipe it off with a dry cloth.When I travel internationally I take a tiny jar of Ponds which weighs virtually nothing and alittle goes a long way.  Liquids are so heavy... I have been using this product for at least 1 1/2 years. I had every intention of writing a product review after about 6 months but time got a way. Today, I really wanted to share my review because I know how important reviews are to me especially with skin care products. For many years, my skin always looked wonderful. I used the same skin care products didn't have a need for makeup and then one day it all changed. I ended up with some dermatitis that was diagnosed as perioral dermatitis finally getting that cleared up through a dermatologist but then ended up with Rosacea. What happened I asked myself? Could it be menopause related?  Possibly!  Fortunately, I found a dermatologist that helped me maintain.However, along the way I was recommended to many different skin care products that only made my skin look red and more red. I just didn't have any luck with a recommendation from them on a cleansing product or moisturizer that wouldn't make my skin look worse. I researched and researched. I bought and bought. Natural, expensive and not so expensive, I have tried. Then, I thought why not Pond's cold cream. My grandmother used it.  So I bought a small jar and gently placed it on my very sensitive skin. I know better than to place all over my face any new product. I started with sections of my face and then eventually applied all over. I can't believe it is a year and a half later and I can say I actually found a skincare cleanser that works for my skin. The product does look like a moisturizer in some ways which made me a little skeptical as well. However, for my skin it does not act like it is overly moisturizing. I think it actually balances my skin. Even though I have Rosacea, I do not consider myself having dry skin. Also, I do not rub my skin. Something I know not to do with my Rosacea. I wet my face and gently apply Ponds with my fingers, I rinse my face and pat dry with a towel. So glad I found Ponds cold cream cleanser. I've been having trouble finding any brand of cold cream in local stores, even store brands or non-Ponds clones. A couple fruitless shopping trips drove me to Amazon, and I found this great deal. I was a bit skeptical, since some other retailers I'd ordered from recently said Oh yes, it's in stock, then after they had my order, informed me it *might* take longer, due to supply chain issues. Sheesh!So, this was actually a big deal for me -- I received 3 containers of Ponds cold cream, well wrapped, no leaking, on the date they said they were due!I love this Seller. I love Ponds. I love this order! ;) Very good at removing makeup. I have been using Ponds Cold Cream since I started wearing makeup 39 years ago. It removes makeup better than any other product. My grandmother used and my mom still does. I believe it is the reason my skin is not so wrinkled."
20,B000VLH8W6,"Pretty graphic review but I have an issue where the legs meet the pelvis in the groin area gets red and irritated. To the point of vivid red line of pain. To cracking and peeling, and the smell is of stinky balls. I SHOWER DAILY. I am a construction worker and I shower EVERY DAY. I exfoliate down there and sometimes until its raw and bleeding. And maybe that's my problem. I went through multiple jock itch creams over the counter and I went through prescription steroidal cream as well. I've WENT TO DOCTORS about my skin issue down there. Sometimes healed and nice, sometimes I go through episodes of couples weeks of chronic pain. Instead of just dealing with it I bought this.Day 1: Chronic pain. Moist. Red. Cracking skin. Raw. Walking hurts. Underwear contact is both a pain and a relief to reduce chaffing.Day 2: Received this body powder for men. Used once in the evening. Instant chaffing results.Day 4: No more swelling, no more moistness, no more red. Completely got rid of it faster than any anti fungal cream. I can't say the smell really helped though. It's not like this product cleans the fungus or whatever the heck this jock itch issue stems from. But with daily showers, good drying, and a daily application (morning) of this powder, you're good to go.PS I have chronic sweating problems so this may be excessive care for someone battling a terrible jock itch that I spent multiple doctor visits trying to address. TO ALL THAT ARE MISINFORMED:Talc does not cause cancer. Prior to 1970, the US, and other countries were relying heavily on Asbestos. Sadly, many talc powders come in contact with asbestos--Which is why you must buy highgrade. Given the fact asbestos is naturally forming, you cannot simply get rid of it. And it is still used by the Navy to strengthen the seals on the ships.However, for sexual intercourse, vaginal or anal, you want to make sure talc doesn't get inside the body; from my research, it would require a great deal of exposure to increase the risk of cancer even through this form of contact.---But I still wouldn't wish to challenge it. As for external use, its safe--With any salts, powders, and such, I do advise not actively breathing it in.Fresh Balls is NOT safer than Balla Powder. As a chemistry nerd, I seek to inform you of a chemical compound in Fresh Balls that is incredibly unhealthy, especially if you use the cream after shaving. This chemical compound is called Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate. This so called ""natural"" preservative will irritate sensitive skin. And it will irritate the eye for an incredibly long time. I suggest you research this.Please do not make false claims as to something causing cancer, when it doesn't. More over, google talc + asbestos + cancer, to get a better understanding.Talc in its free form is made up of hydrated magnesium silicate. Merely a salt of magnesium. The links between pure magnesium silicate and cancer are not truly known. Magnesium is a critical element in biological synthesis.It is worth noting that crayola, prang, and roseArt all use talc in their crayons which have been tested for asbestos, and DO contain it.WARNING:THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS POWDER IS EXPENSIVE. IT IS EXTENSIVELY TESTED FOR ASBESTOS---THUS COSTS MORE THAN GOLD BOND.BALLA POWDER IS SAFER THAN FRESH BALLS I am very sensitive to smell due to chronic migraines. so there for my husband is very limited on body products he can use. This powder is not overwhelming it’s nice and a masculine but clean. This stuff works wonders. I work in a warehouse most of the time and it gets hot when you're throwing furniture and large electronics around all day. A big issue I had was discomfort in the jewels due to the sweat sticking to my thigh, and don't even get me started on the smell when I get home. I put a little on this on my sack and thighs every morning after I shower and I no longer deal with that. I work 10-14 hour shifts usually and this still holds up very well. I forgot to put it on once and it was most uncomfortable shift ever. The only issue I had with it is that I got a slight skin reaction when I first started using it. That's just me though, as I come from a family with sensitive skin it was of no surprise. This works wonders for me, it is pricey but I wanted pure talc. I read that good bond occasionally is laced with asbestos due to the facilities it's packaged in and if I'm using this primarily on my prizes possessions then I'd rather not have something like that around. As far as how long this lasts, I've only been using it for 1 month so I'll update when I run out. Great stuff though Ok, I never had ""bat wings"".  Never ever knew what they were, but not I will definitely not have them.  I received the original scent in a travel size as a promotional item.  I looked at the package and laughed, but I tried it.  Now I am a true believer.  I use this every day.  In fact, I have it on right now.  For Christmas I gave out a few of these at a get together.  (Great cheap gift!)  Everyone laughed.  Then maybe a week later I was thanked several times over.As to the product.  Well, talc is talc.  Maybe I am ignorant but I don't see powers varying too much in effectiveness.  This is the only one that I have tried.  But I have smelled others.  I won't use em!  This one smells great, manly but sophisticated.In summary:  Not only do I love it and wear it every day, but everyone I have given it to says the same.  (Who wouldn't appreciate staying and smelling fresh down there all day long.)BTW, the ""bat wings"" reference comes from the back of the product.  It has to do with part of your anatomy being stuck to your leg.  (yes I had to look this up.)"

22,B0006NYCT6,"This bubble bath was a great purchase. Spent a little bit more than I wanted too, but glad I did! It smells wonderful and the deep blue adds to a nice long soak. Will purchase again. It smells so fresh and turns the bath water an intense shade of blue. I'm not one to fuss over the price of anything, but I must say that reviewer ""J. Swofford"" made a point that almost made me skip this purchase (at $24.70/bottle). He/she (that is to say I'm not sure. I'm not implying that ""J. Swofford"" is trans-gendered) said ""People in the US that know about it, think of it as something exotic, though in Germany it is sold in drugstores and supermarkets"". I felt that this was useful to know, because it's probably best not to encourage the 3rd party sellers to overcharge on this product. If It was $15 fine, but at almost $25 for this, I had to wonder if it was really worth it.However, my girlfriend (who likes to sit in a bubble bath reading her Kindle), had recently expressed concern about the bubbly-ness  of whatever stuff we got from Sephora. So, I got the Algemarin stuff for her as a surprise. She WAS surprised.PRO:* It Smells GREAT (says my GF)! I have no sense of smell, so I can't comment on this, but many other reviews support this opinion.* It makes a generous amount of bubbles...but you have to dump a generous amount of product under the running water to get this.* Turns the water a Smurfy blue.CON:* Mo' produc = mo' bubbles. It's not necessarily negative, but the cost-to-benefit starts to become harder to justify if you're looking for crazy-dense super-bubbles.* A little overpriced for an item that is COMMON in Germany. I'm get that it's imported, but its also ""just"" soap (and it's common soap). I truly hope you understand what I'm trying to convey. I've bought plenty of imported (NOT from Asia) items in my lifetime (perfumes, foods, clothing, jewelry, etc.).Bottom Line:This stuff is GREAT for a person who likes a great non-baby smelling bubble bath, but who doesn't need soooo many bubbles that you could keep an anvil afloat.  :-) I had never heard of this brand before and bought it purely based on the reviews. I love it! It smells excellent (kind of herbal, a scent that doesn't feel gendered in any way) and turns the water soooo blue. It does not stain the tub or your skin blue. It makes the water feel SO soft... gives you that feeling of getting into clean sheets with freshly shaved legs, only you don't have to shave!It makes a decent amount of bubbles, maybe slightly disappointing, but my bubble expectations are based on movies, and to get such delightful mountains of foam you need to use like half a bottle of*any* bubble bath. IIt's ridiculously expensive but I actually think it is worth it.. Very soothing. Soft scent. Love itWe order often It's a neutral clean ocean scent, colors the water a pretty blue, and thick foamy bubbles. Definately leaves skin moisturized too. Concentrated- little bit goes quite a ways, you only need 2 capfuls for a tub, or more if you're feelin fancy. Blast from the past... just like I remembered my omi buying me this for me & my kids we thought we where royals when we got this pre... the smell is so clean and fresh it’s great for bubble bath or shower soap whatever your in the mood for the smell last for a long time it’s a great soaking spa also... the only drawback is the price it’s kinda pricey but hey I get it... it’s the real deal!!! Love it FR but you won’t like it so don’t buy it that way they always have it in stock for me... lol 😂 It's a German product and I'm German. I loved the product sind my early childhood. Unfortunately, since 2018 it was not longer produced in Germany as there wasn't any market any longer. A bottle with 750 ml was about round 5 US$. I ask the manufacturer and what's funny: it's still produced in Germany und will then exported to Canada exclusively. For two bottles I paid 95US$ with shipping and customs.But I love it too much."
